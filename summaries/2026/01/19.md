The `c:\Users\91965\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json` file, representing Visual Studio Code user settings, was updated on January 19, 2026, at 12:18:52 PM.

Key changes and configurations include:

*   **Editor Formatting and Behavior**: The global default formatter is set to `esbenp.prettier-vscode`. `editor.formatOnSave` is enabled, and `editor.insertSpaces` is set to `false`. For Python, `editor.formatOnType` is enabled. Specific formatters are configured for HTML (`vscode.html-language-features`) and JavaScript React (`vscode.typescript-language-features`). `files.autoSave` is set to `afterDelay`. `editor.mouseWheelZoom` is enabled, and `editor.accessibilitySupport` is turned `off`.
*   **Code Runner**: The `code-runner` extension is configured to run code in the terminal and automatically save all files before execution.
*   **Version Control Integration**: Enhanced accessibility for Git Graph is enabled, Git terminal editor is activated, and GitLens current line features are enabled with a specific date format. GitHub Copilot's next edit suggestions are also enabled.
*   **C/C++ Development**: The `C_Cpp.updateChannel` is set to "Insiders," and `C_Cpp.codeAnalysis.updateDelay` is configured.
*   **Miscellaneous Settings**: The `workbench.colorTheme` is set to "Visual Studio Dark - C++". `explorer.confirmDragAndDrop` is disabled. Live Share sounds are disabled, and Live Server's tag verification is turned off.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:

*   There is a strong emphasis on **automated code formatting**, with `formatOnSave`, `formatOnType`, and specific default formatters for multiple languages configured.
*   The settings show a clear intent to **enhance developer productivity** through tools like Code Runner, GitLens, and GitHub Copilot.
*   Multiple default formatter settings for JavaScript/React and HTML, some commented out, indicate **fine-tuning of language-specific development environments**.
