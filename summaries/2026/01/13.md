# Activity Summary for 1/13/2026

## 9:23:08 AM
The `FileManagerGridItem.jsx` file, updated on `1/13/2026, 1:00:02 AM`, introduces a React functional component designed to display individual file items within a grid.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManagerGridItem.jsx`):**
The component imports various icons for download, delete, edit, and preview functionalities, along with utility functions for displaying file type icons (`iconObj`) and web tracking (`trackWeb`, `EVENTS`). It renders a list item (`<li>`) containing file details such as title, creator, size, and last modified date.
Key actions available for each file are:
*   **Preview**: Always visible, triggers a modal for preview, and tracks the "Preview File" button click.
*   **Edit File Name**: Conditionally rendered based on `permissions?.edit_case_document`, allowing users to edit the file name.
*   **Download**: Always visible, triggers a download modal, and tracks the "Download File" button click.
*   **Delete**: Conditionally rendered based on `permissions?.delete_case_document`, allowing users to delete the file.
Each action button calls a `handleModal` prop with the action type and file data, centralizing the modal logic in a parent component. File titles are displayed with an appropriate icon based on their extension.

**Timestamp of Significant Changes:**
The single recorded change occurred on `1/13/2026, 1:00:02 AM`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
*   **Permission-based rendering**: Actions like "Edit File Name" and "Delete" are only shown if specific permissions (`edit_case_document`, `delete_case_document`) are present in the `data.permissions` object.
*   **Centralized Modal Handling**: All file actions (preview, edit, download, delete) are delegated to a `handleModal` prop, suggesting a common modal management system in a parent component.
*   **Web Tracking Integration**: Click events for "Preview File" and "Download File" are explicitly tracked using `trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED, { buttonName: "...", entityId: trackingId })`, indicating a consistent approach to analytics for user interactions.
