# Activity Summary for 1/17/2026

## 1:42:19 PM
The changes log details updates across two main components: `Files.tsx` and `Calendar.tsx`, with a related `FileManagerGrid.tsx` component also receiving updates.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (1/16/2026, 3:08:21 PM):** This component was introduced as `Files` for managing contract documents. It included features like search, sorting (latest/oldest), pagination, download, and delete actions. It initialized its `files` state with a static array of mock data and integrated various Ant Design components for UI. It also rendered a `FileManagerGrid` component.
    *   **Minor Debugging (1/16/2026, 6:00:06 PM - 6:00:25 PM):** Small changes were made to introduce and then refine a `console.log` statement for `access_token` retrieved from `localStorage`, likely for debugging authentication flows. No functional changes to the file management logic itself.
    *   **Major Refactoring Attempt (1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM):** The component underwent a significant change. The entire original code was commented out, and a new implementation was introduced. This new version aimed to fetch file data dynamically from an API (`${ROOT_URL}/contract-documents`) using `axios` and a `useEffect` hook, relying on a `document_id` obtained from `useSearchParams`. The static mock data was removed in favor of this dynamic fetching.
    *   **Significant Rollback (1/17/2026, 11:47:21 AM):** Shortly after the refactoring attempt, the component largely reverted to its previous state from 1/16/2026. The dynamic data fetching logic using `useEffect`, `useSearchParams`, and `axios` was removed, and the `files` state was re-initialized with the original static mock data. The large commented-out block was also removed. This indicates the dynamic fetching feature was either not ready, encountered issues, or was temporarily sidelined.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\Calendar\Calendar.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup with Commented Calendar (1/16/2026, 5:08:58 PM):** This component established a calendar view with filter options (contract start, end, renewal, execution, obligation). It used Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) to manage filter states (`calendarFilters`, `teamFilterKeys`). Notably, the core `CalendarModule` component was commented out, preventing the calendar display.
    *   **Calendar Module Enabled (1/16/2026, 5:09:13 PM):** A quick update followed, uncommenting the `CalendarModule` component and passing the necessary filter props, making the calendar display functional.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx`**
    *   **Temporary Disablement (1/17/2026, 11:44:29 AM):** The entire component's code was commented out, effectively disabling its functionality. The commented code shows a sophisticated file manager grid capable of displaying files in a tree-like folder structure, managing selections, and providing actions (edit, delete, download) for both files and folders.
    *   **Restoration (1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM):** Within minutes, the `FileManagerGrid.tsx` component's code was uncommented and fully restored, bringing back its complete functionality for hierarchical file display and management.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/16/2026, 5:09:13 PM:** The `CalendarModule` component in `Calendar.tsx` was re-enabled, making the calendar functional after being commented out.
*   **1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM:** A major overhaul to `Files.tsx` began, attempting to switch from static data to dynamic API fetching.
*   **1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM:** `FileManagerGrid.tsx` was fully restored after being temporarily commented out.
*   **1/17/2026, 11:47:21 AM:** `Files.tsx` reverted its API integration attempt, falling back to static data. This happened very close in time to the `FileManagerGrid.tsx` restoration, suggesting interconnected development or a shared point of temporary instability.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Ant Design and React Hooks:** All components extensively use Ant Design for UI and React hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`) for state and lifecycle management.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Debugging:** The close proximity of timestamps for multiple commits (e.g., within seconds or minutes) suggests active, rapid development cycles, quick fixes, and debugging efforts. The `console.log` changes and the temporary commenting/uncommenting of entire components or sections of code further support this.
*   **Temporary Feature Toggling/Disabling:** The pattern of commenting out entire components or significant code blocks (`CalendarModule`, `Files.tsx` refactor, `FileManagerGrid.tsx`) suggests features were temporarily disabled for development, testing, or troubleshooting, then quickly re-enabled or reverted.
*   **Data Management Strategy:** There's an evident struggle or transition in `Files.tsx` regarding data sourcing, moving from static mock data to an API integration attempt, and then reverting to static data. This suggests that the backend API for file management might still be under development or integration challenges were faced.
*   **Component Interdependence:** The timing of changes to `Files.tsx` and `FileManagerGrid.tsx` implies they are closely related, with changes in one often coinciding with changes in the other.
