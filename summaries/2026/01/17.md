# Activity Summary for 1/17/2026

## 1:42:19 PM
The changes log details updates across two main components: `Files.tsx` and `Calendar.tsx`, with a related `FileManagerGrid.tsx` component also receiving updates.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (1/16/2026, 3:08:21 PM):** This component was introduced as `Files` for managing contract documents. It included features like search, sorting (latest/oldest), pagination, download, and delete actions. It initialized its `files` state with a static array of mock data and integrated various Ant Design components for UI. It also rendered a `FileManagerGrid` component.
    *   **Minor Debugging (1/16/2026, 6:00:06 PM - 6:00:25 PM):** Small changes were made to introduce and then refine a `console.log` statement for `access_token` retrieved from `localStorage`, likely for debugging authentication flows. No functional changes to the file management logic itself.
    *   **Major Refactoring Attempt (1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM):** The component underwent a significant change. The entire original code was commented out, and a new implementation was introduced. This new version aimed to fetch file data dynamically from an API (`${ROOT_URL}/contract-documents`) using `axios` and a `useEffect` hook, relying on a `document_id` obtained from `useSearchParams`. The static mock data was removed in favor of this dynamic fetching.
    *   **Significant Rollback (1/17/2026, 11:47:21 AM):** Shortly after the refactoring attempt, the component largely reverted to its previous state from 1/16/2026. The dynamic data fetching logic using `useEffect`, `useSearchParams`, and `axios` was removed, and the `files` state was re-initialized with the original static mock data. The large commented-out block was also removed. This indicates the dynamic fetching feature was either not ready, encountered issues, or was temporarily sidelined.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\Calendar\Calendar.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup with Commented Calendar (1/16/2026, 5:08:58 PM):** This component established a calendar view with filter options (contract start, end, renewal, execution, obligation). It used Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) to manage filter states (`calendarFilters`, `teamFilterKeys`). Notably, the core `CalendarModule` component was commented out, preventing the calendar display.
    *   **Calendar Module Enabled (1/16/2026, 5:09:13 PM):** A quick update followed, uncommenting the `CalendarModule` component and passing the necessary filter props, making the calendar display functional.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx`**
    *   **Temporary Disablement (1/17/2026, 11:44:29 AM):** The entire component's code was commented out, effectively disabling its functionality. The commented code shows a sophisticated file manager grid capable of displaying files in a tree-like folder structure, managing selections, and providing actions (edit, delete, download) for both files and folders.
    *   **Restoration (1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM):** Within minutes, the `FileManagerGrid.tsx` component's code was uncommented and fully restored, bringing back its complete functionality for hierarchical file display and management.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/16/2026, 5:09:13 PM:** The `CalendarModule` component in `Calendar.tsx` was re-enabled, making the calendar functional after being commented out.
*   **1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM:** A major overhaul to `Files.tsx` began, attempting to switch from static data to dynamic API fetching.
*   **1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM:** `FileManagerGrid.tsx` was fully restored after being temporarily commented out.
*   **1/17/2026, 11:47:21 AM:** `Files.tsx` reverted its API integration attempt, falling back to static data. This happened very close in time to the `FileManagerGrid.tsx` restoration, suggesting interconnected development or a shared point of temporary instability.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Ant Design and React Hooks:** All components extensively use Ant Design for UI and React hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`) for state and lifecycle management.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Debugging:** The close proximity of timestamps for multiple commits (e.g., within seconds or minutes) suggests active, rapid development cycles, quick fixes, and debugging efforts. The `console.log` changes and the temporary commenting/uncommenting of entire components or sections of code further support this.
*   **Temporary Feature Toggling/Disabling:** The pattern of commenting out entire components or significant code blocks (`CalendarModule`, `Files.tsx` refactor, `FileManagerGrid.tsx`) suggests features were temporarily disabled for development, testing, or troubleshooting, then quickly re-enabled or reverted.
*   **Data Management Strategy:** There's an evident struggle or transition in `Files.tsx` regarding data sourcing, moving from static mock data to an API integration attempt, and then reverting to static data. This suggests that the backend API for file management might still be under development or integration challenges were faced.
*   **Component Interdependence:** The timing of changes to `Files.tsx` and `FileManagerGrid.tsx` implies they are closely related, with changes in one often coinciding with changes in the other.

## 2:42:18 PM
The log details changes across several frontend components and a user configuration file.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup (1/16/2026, 3:08:21 PM)**: The `Files` component was set up with React hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`) for managing search text, selected items, pagination, and sorting. It initially used hardcoded mock data for `files` and provided basic UI elements for searching, filtering, downloading, and deleting files, leveraging Ant Design components.
    *   **Access Token Logging (1/16/2026, 6:00:06 PM - 6:00:19 PM)**: Minor changes involved adding code to retrieve `access_token` from `localStorage` and log it to the console for debugging purposes.
    *   **Attempted API Integration and Subsequent Revert (1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM - 1:51:48 PM)**: A significant change was introduced to fetch file data from a backend API (`${ROOT_URL}/contract-documents`) using `axios` and the `useSearchParams` hook to get a `document_id`. The component's `files` state was updated to be populated dynamically. However, this entire API integration logic was then commented out and the component reverted to using its initial mock data setup, retaining the commented-out API integration as inactive code. Multiple subsequent timestamps (1:49:00 PM, 1:49:40 PM, 1:49:52 PM, 1:51:21 PM, 1:51:48 PM) show identical code, indicating repeated saves or minor, unrecorded edits during this revert period.
    *   **New Utility and Redux Imports (1/17/2026, 1:55:09 PM - 2:26:28 PM)**: Further changes included attempts to import `useOnlineStatus` (initially with incomplete paths, later corrected) and successfully importing `useDispatch` from `react-redux`, even though Redux isn't actively used in the provided snippet of this component's code.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\Calendar\Calendar.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup with Disabled Calendar Module (1/16/2026, 5:08:58 PM)**: The `Calendar` container component was established, utilizing Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for state management of calendar filters (contract start, end, renewal, execution, obligation). The main `CalendarModule` component was commented out and thus not rendered.
    *   **Calendar Module Enabled (1/16/2026, 5:09:13 PM)**: The `CalendarModule` component was uncommented, activating its rendering and passing various filter and state management props to it.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx`**
    *   **Component Commented Out (1/17/2026, 11:44:29 AM)**: The entire `FileManagerGrid` component was commented out, effectively disabling its functionality. This component is responsible for rendering file data in a grid, including folder structures, search, selection, and delete/download actions.
    *   **Component Restored (1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM)**: The `FileManagerGrid` component was uncommented, restoring its full functionality, including its complex tree-like display for folders and files, checkbox-based selection, and integration with a `DeleteModal`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\utils\functions\useOnlineStatus.ts`**
    *   **New Online Status Hook (1/17/2026, 1:54:26 PM)**: A new React hook `useOnlineStatus` was created. This hook tracks and exposes the user's internet connectivity status by listening to `online` and `offline` browser events, with considerations for server-side rendering (SSR).

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Frequent Code Commenting/Uncommenting**: There's a noticeable pattern, particularly in `Files.tsx` and `FileManagerGrid.tsx`, where entire component logic or significant sections were commented out and then uncommented. This suggests active development, testing, or temporary disabling of features.
*   **Ant Design UI Library**: All modified React components extensively use Ant Design components (e.g., `Input`, `Button`, `Select`, `Pagination`, `message`, `Dropdown`, `Checkbox`), indicating a consistent choice for the UI framework.
*   **Debugging with `console.log`**: Repeated use of `console.log("access", access_token);` in `Files.tsx` highlights a focus on debugging authorization tokens during development.
*   **State Management with React Hooks and Redux**: `useState` and `useMemo` are fundamental for local component state, while Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) is used for global state in the `Calendar` component.
*   **Module Organization**: Components are organized logically under `components/Contracts/Files` and `containers/Calendar`, with utilities in `utils/functions`.
