# Activity Summary for 1/6/2026

## 1:49:29 PM
The changes span two files, `app\layout.tsx` and `components\_constants\about.ts`, with distinct types of updates.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\layout.tsx` underwent a significant update on **1/5/2026, 4:25:09 PM**. Key changes include:
*   Importing a global CSS file (`globals.css`).
*   Defining application-level metadata, setting the `title` to 'MikeLegal Services Private Limited' and `description` to 'MikeLegal | AI-powered Legal Solutions'. The `metadataBase` is set to `https://www.mikelegal.com/`, and a favicon is specified.
*   Integrating a local font, 'SF-Pro-Display', with various weights (400, 500, 600, 700).
*   Adding an inline JavaScript `script` within the `<head>` section. This script implements a delayed fade-out effect for a page loader element after 1.5 seconds.
*   Commented-out components for `Loader`, `GoogleAnalytics`, and `CookieBanner` are present in the `<body>`, suggesting they might be enabled or removed in future iterations.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\about.ts` saw a rapid series of updates on **1/5/2026**, starting from **9:02:21 PM** and continuing until **9:49:34 PM**. These frequent modifications primarily targeted the `teamData` array, while the `mediaTestimonialData` array and the `ArrowProps` interface remained unchanged across all entries.
Key patterns and changes in `teamData` include:
*   **Designation Updates:** Numerous team members had their job titles adjusted, such as "Gaurav Ashish" from 'Finance Controller' to 'Accounts Manager', "Sangita Sarkar" to 'Global Sales Executive', "Lakshmi Seetharaman" to 'Customer Success Manager', "Tanya Chaitanya Mishra" (originally Paula Ghose) to 'Marketing Manager', "Vishal Dhiman" to 'IT Product Manager', "Mohit Sharma" to 'Product Manager', "Aniket Rathore" to 'Senior Backend Developer', "Rajnis Kumar" to 'Backend Developer', "Anamika Singh" to 'Anamika Singh Kant' with designation 'SDET', and "Kriti Kalpa Saha" to 'Front End Developer'.
*   **New Team Members & Name Clarifications:** Several new individuals were added to the team list, including "Nitin Kumar Sharma", "Aayushi Singh", "Gopal Krishna", "Ayush Chandra", "Abhijeet Singh", "Ammar Abdur Raheman", "Salwyn Joseph Mathew", "Priyanshu Maurya", "Sandip Saha", "Anuj Kumar", and "Sharvari Shashikant Kothawade". Some existing names were refined (e.g., "Rohit Pal" to "Rohit Singh Pal", "Priyanshu" to "Priyanshu Maurya", "Parth Prajapati" to "Parth Rasikbhai Prajapati").
*   **Extensive Image Refactoring:** A prominent and recurring pattern involved a significant consolidation of image assets. Many individual image imports (`paula`, `shreyanshu`, `nitin`, `deeksha`, `akriti`, `anand`, `vijit`, `monojit`, `parth`, `rohit`, `salwyn`) were removed from the import statements in several steps between **9:19:42 PM** and **9:49:25 PM**. Concurrently, the `img` property for numerous team members in the `teamData` array was changed to reference `angsuman` instead of their original, unique images. This suggests a shift to using a common placeholder or default image (likely `angsuman.webp`) for many team profiles. There were temporary re-introductions of specific images for new entries, which were then also often reverted to `angsuman` or removed from imports.
*   **Reordering and Deletion:** Entries within the `teamData` array were reordered multiple times, and a previously existing entry for "Monojit Das" was commented out and subsequently removed entirely from the array.

The changes log shows concentrated activity on January 6, 2026, across several React components related to file management within a "CaseTrack" frontend application. The updates primarily focus on enhancing file upload, download, deletion, renaming, and preview functionalities, often involving interactions with a backend API for document storage.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple identical entries from 1/6/2026, 12:00:30 PM to 1/6/2026, 12:09:33 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** The code content remained consistent across these timestamps. This component serves as a versatile file upload grid, supporting uploads, downloads, renames, and deletions for various document types (Expense, Payment Received, Timesheet Log, Task). It uses Redux for state management, Ant Design for UI, `axios` for API calls, and `JSZip` and `file-saver` for folder operations. It includes detailed logic for handling file/folder changes, modal interactions, and tracking web events.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManagerGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Two identical entries from 1/6/2026, 12:10:57 PM to 1/6/2026, 12:11:08 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** The code content remained consistent across these timestamps. This component provides a file manager grid specifically for "NOTICE_DOCUMENT" types. It handles file deletion, renaming, and folder operations (download/delete) with size calculations (`parseSizeToBytes`, `formatBytes`). It builds a hierarchical tree structure for file display and integrates with Ant Design for user feedback.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\FilePreviewModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Several significant updates between 1/6/2026, 12:34:45 PM and 1/6/2026, 1:03:40 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** This component is responsible for previewing various file types (images, PDFs, and office documents via `iframe`).
        *   Initial versions handled PDF password prompting using `window.prompt` (12:34:45 PM, 12:45:04 PM).
        *   There were transient attempts to refactor the PDF password handling using `useRef` and `useState` for a dedicated password modal, but these were commented out or reverted in subsequent saves (12:43:26 PM, 12:50:36 PM).
        *   The logic for handling `window.prompt` responses for PDF passwords was refined multiple times:
            *   Initially, an empty password would show an error or close the modal (12:34:45 PM).
            *   Later, it allowed empty passwords to pass or closed the modal without explicit error on empty password (12:51:25 PM, 12:51:58 PM, 12:52:28 PM).
            *   **Significant Change (1/6/2026, 12:57:00 PM):** A `while(true)` loop was introduced within the `onPassword` callback. This loop repeatedly prompts the user for a non-empty password if they click "OK" with an empty input, or it closes the modal if the user cancels the prompt. This improves the robustness of password handling for encrypted PDFs. The content at 1:03:40 PM is identical to this.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\TDSATDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Updates between 1/6/2026, 1:12:41 PM and 1/6/2026, 1:15:44 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** This component displays detailed information for TDSAT cases, including cause list, proceedings, and orders. The `FileManager` component (presumably for case-related documents) was repeatedly commented out and then re-included, suggesting active testing or conditional rendering adjustments for the file management section within TDSAT case details.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple identical entries from 1/6/2026, 1:14:18 PM to 1/6/2026, 1:38:18 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** The code content remained consistent across these timestamps. This `FileManager` component specifically handles file uploads and downloads for "CASE_DOCUMENT" types. It uses S3 pre-signed URLs for efficient uploads, tracks upload progress with cancellation functionality, and manages file lists. It includes a `multiLevelPath` utility for directory paths.

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\SupremeCourtDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Two identical entries from 1/6/2026, 1:15:56 PM to 1/6/2026, 1:25:42 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** The code content remained consistent across these timestamps. This component displays Supreme Court case details, using a `useSupremeCourtDetails` hook. Similar to `TDSATDetails.jsx`, it includes the `FileManager` and `NotesManager` components within its structure, indicating integrated file and note management for Supreme Court cases.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 1/6/2026, 1:38:48 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** This is another `FileManager` component, distinct from the `case_status` one, and is tailored for "NOTICE_DOCUMENT" management. It shares core upload/download logic with the other file managers but incorporates Sentry for error reporting and explicitly defines a `Dropdown` menu for file and folder upload options. It includes a centralized `handleAxiosError` function.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent API Interaction:** All file management components communicate with a backend API at `${ROOT_URL}/upload_documents/` using `axios`, typically sending `document_for` (e.g., `CASE_DOCUMENT`, `NOTICE_DOCUMENT`, `EXPENSE_DOCUMENT`) and an entity ID. Authentication uses `Bearer` tokens obtained via `getValidAccessToken()`.
*   **Centralized Error Handling:** `message.error` and `console.error` are prevalent for user feedback and debugging. `handleAxiosError` is used across multiple file managers for consistent Axios error processing, with Sentry integration in `all_notices/FileManager.jsx` for enhanced error tracking.
*   **UI/UX Consistency:** Ant Design components (Modal, Dropdown, message, Pagination) are extensively used across all file-related components, ensuring a uniform look and feel. Custom UI components (Loader2, ConfirmationModal, FilePreviewModal, UploadProgressBar) are also reused.
*   **File Operations Standardization:** The core functionalities of uploading (single file, folders), downloading (single file, all files in a folder/case), deleting (single file, folders), and renaming files are implemented uniformly across relevant components.
*   **Web Event Tracking:** `trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED, ...)` is consistently employed for analytics on user interactions with file management features.
*   **Upload Management:** Components dealing with uploads implement progress tracking (`uploadStatus`), modal visibility (`isUploadModalVisible`), and cancellation logic (`AbortController`). A `isUploadingRef` is used to prevent concurrent uploads.
*   **Hierarchical Data Structures:** File managers for `all_notices` and `NewFileUploadGrid` use functions to build tree structures for organizing files and folders, enabling operations like calculating folder sizes and collecting files within a folder recursively.
*   **Dependency Management:** Monorepo paths like `@case-track-mono/Configs`, `@case-track-mono/Store`, and `@case-track-mono/Utils` indicate a structured project setup with shared utilities and configurations.
