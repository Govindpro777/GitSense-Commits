# Activity Summary for 1/6/2026

## 1:49:29 PM
The changes span two files, `app\layout.tsx` and `components\_constants\about.ts`, with distinct types of updates.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\layout.tsx` underwent a significant update on **1/5/2026, 4:25:09 PM**. Key changes include:
*   Importing a global CSS file (`globals.css`).
*   Defining application-level metadata, setting the `title` to 'MikeLegal Services Private Limited' and `description` to 'MikeLegal | AI-powered Legal Solutions'. The `metadataBase` is set to `https://www.mikelegal.com/`, and a favicon is specified.
*   Integrating a local font, 'SF-Pro-Display', with various weights (400, 500, 600, 700).
*   Adding an inline JavaScript `script` within the `<head>` section. This script implements a delayed fade-out effect for a page loader element after 1.5 seconds.
*   Commented-out components for `Loader`, `GoogleAnalytics`, and `CookieBanner` are present in the `<body>`, suggesting they might be enabled or removed in future iterations.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\about.ts` saw a rapid series of updates on **1/5/2026**, starting from **9:02:21 PM** and continuing until **9:49:34 PM**. These frequent modifications primarily targeted the `teamData` array, while the `mediaTestimonialData` array and the `ArrowProps` interface remained unchanged across all entries.
Key patterns and changes in `teamData` include:
*   **Designation Updates:** Numerous team members had their job titles adjusted, such as "Gaurav Ashish" from 'Finance Controller' to 'Accounts Manager', "Sangita Sarkar" to 'Global Sales Executive', "Lakshmi Seetharaman" to 'Customer Success Manager', "Tanya Chaitanya Mishra" (originally Paula Ghose) to 'Marketing Manager', "Vishal Dhiman" to 'IT Product Manager', "Mohit Sharma" to 'Product Manager', "Aniket Rathore" to 'Senior Backend Developer', "Rajnis Kumar" to 'Backend Developer', "Anamika Singh" to 'Anamika Singh Kant' with designation 'SDET', and "Kriti Kalpa Saha" to 'Front End Developer'.
*   **New Team Members & Name Clarifications:** Several new individuals were added to the team list, including "Nitin Kumar Sharma", "Aayushi Singh", "Gopal Krishna", "Ayush Chandra", "Abhijeet Singh", "Ammar Abdur Raheman", "Salwyn Joseph Mathew", "Priyanshu Maurya", "Sandip Saha", "Anuj Kumar", and "Sharvari Shashikant Kothawade". Some existing names were refined (e.g., "Rohit Pal" to "Rohit Singh Pal", "Priyanshu" to "Priyanshu Maurya", "Parth Prajapati" to "Parth Rasikbhai Prajapati").
*   **Extensive Image Refactoring:** A prominent and recurring pattern involved a significant consolidation of image assets. Many individual image imports (`paula`, `shreyanshu`, `nitin`, `deeksha`, `akriti`, `anand`, `vijit`, `monojit`, `parth`, `rohit`, `salwyn`) were removed from the import statements in several steps between **9:19:42 PM** and **9:49:25 PM**. Concurrently, the `img` property for numerous team members in the `teamData` array was changed to reference `angsuman` instead of their original, unique images. This suggests a shift to using a common placeholder or default image (likely `angsuman.webp`) for many team profiles. There were temporary re-introductions of specific images for new entries, which were then also often reverted to `angsuman` or removed from imports.
*   **Reordering and Deletion:** Entries within the `teamData` array were reordered multiple times, and a previously existing entry for "Monojit Das" was commented out and subsequently removed entirely from the array.
