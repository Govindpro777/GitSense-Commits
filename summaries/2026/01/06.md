# Activity Summary for 1/6/2026

## 1:49:29 PM
The changes span two files, `app\layout.tsx` and `components\_constants\about.ts`, with distinct types of updates.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\layout.tsx` underwent a significant update on **1/5/2026, 4:25:09 PM**. Key changes include:
*   Importing a global CSS file (`globals.css`).
*   Defining application-level metadata, setting the `title` to 'MikeLegal Services Private Limited' and `description` to 'MikeLegal | AI-powered Legal Solutions'. The `metadataBase` is set to `https://www.mikelegal.com/`, and a favicon is specified.
*   Integrating a local font, 'SF-Pro-Display', with various weights (400, 500, 600, 700).
*   Adding an inline JavaScript `script` within the `<head>` section. This script implements a delayed fade-out effect for a page loader element after 1.5 seconds.
*   Commented-out components for `Loader`, `GoogleAnalytics`, and `CookieBanner` are present in the `<body>`, suggesting they might be enabled or removed in future iterations.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\about.ts` saw a rapid series of updates on **1/5/2026**, starting from **9:02:21 PM** and continuing until **9:49:34 PM**. These frequent modifications primarily targeted the `teamData` array, while the `mediaTestimonialData` array and the `ArrowProps` interface remained unchanged across all entries.
Key patterns and changes in `teamData` include:
*   **Designation Updates:** Numerous team members had their job titles adjusted, such as "Gaurav Ashish" from 'Finance Controller' to 'Accounts Manager', "Sangita Sarkar" to 'Global Sales Executive', "Lakshmi Seetharaman" to 'Customer Success Manager', "Tanya Chaitanya Mishra" (originally Paula Ghose) to 'Marketing Manager', "Vishal Dhiman" to 'IT Product Manager', "Mohit Sharma" to 'Product Manager', "Aniket Rathore" to 'Senior Backend Developer', "Rajnis Kumar" to 'Backend Developer', "Anamika Singh" to 'Anamika Singh Kant' with designation 'SDET', and "Kriti Kalpa Saha" to 'Front End Developer'.
*   **New Team Members & Name Clarifications:** Several new individuals were added to the team list, including "Nitin Kumar Sharma", "Aayushi Singh", "Gopal Krishna", "Ayush Chandra", "Abhijeet Singh", "Ammar Abdur Raheman", "Salwyn Joseph Mathew", "Priyanshu Maurya", "Sandip Saha", "Anuj Kumar", and "Sharvari Shashikant Kothawade". Some existing names were refined (e.g., "Rohit Pal" to "Rohit Singh Pal", "Priyanshu" to "Priyanshu Maurya", "Parth Prajapati" to "Parth Rasikbhai Prajapati").
*   **Extensive Image Refactoring:** A prominent and recurring pattern involved a significant consolidation of image assets. Many individual image imports (`paula`, `shreyanshu`, `nitin`, `deeksha`, `akriti`, `anand`, `vijit`, `monojit`, `parth`, `rohit`, `salwyn`) were removed from the import statements in several steps between **9:19:42 PM** and **9:49:25 PM**. Concurrently, the `img` property for numerous team members in the `teamData` array was changed to reference `angsuman` instead of their original, unique images. This suggests a shift to using a common placeholder or default image (likely `angsuman.webp`) for many team profiles. There were temporary re-introductions of specific images for new entries, which were then also often reverted to `angsuman` or removed from imports.
*   **Reordering and Deletion:** Entries within the `teamData` array were reordered multiple times, and a previously existing entry for "Monojit Das" was commented out and subsequently removed entirely from the array.

## 2:06:46 PM
The changes log shows concentrated activity on January 6, 2026, across several React components related to file management within a "CaseTrack" frontend application. The updates primarily focus on enhancing file upload, download, deletion, renaming, and preview functionalities, often involving interactions with a backend API for document storage.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple identical entries from 1/6/2026, 12:00:30 PM to 1/6/2026, 12:09:33 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** The code content remained consistent across these timestamps. This component serves as a versatile file upload grid, supporting uploads, downloads, renames, and deletions for various document types (Expense, Payment Received, Timesheet Log, Task). It uses Redux for state management, Ant Design for UI, `axios` for API calls, and `JSZip` and `file-saver` for folder operations. It includes detailed logic for handling file/folder changes, modal interactions, and tracking web events.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManagerGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Two identical entries from 1/6/2026, 12:10:57 PM to 1/6/2026, 12:11:08 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** The code content remained consistent across these timestamps. This component provides a file manager grid specifically for "NOTICE_DOCUMENT" types. It handles file deletion, renaming, and folder operations (download/delete) with size calculations (`parseSizeToBytes`, `formatBytes`). It builds a hierarchical tree structure for file display and integrates with Ant Design for user feedback.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\FilePreviewModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Several significant updates between 1/6/2026, 12:34:45 PM and 1/6/2026, 1:03:40 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** This component is responsible for previewing various file types (images, PDFs, and office documents via `iframe`).
        *   Initial versions handled PDF password prompting using `window.prompt` (12:34:45 PM, 12:45:04 PM).
        *   There were transient attempts to refactor the PDF password handling using `useRef` and `useState` for a dedicated password modal, but these were commented out or reverted in subsequent saves (12:43:26 PM, 12:50:36 PM).
        *   The logic for handling `window.prompt` responses for PDF passwords was refined multiple times:
            *   Initially, an empty password would show an error or close the modal (12:34:45 PM).
            *   Later, it allowed empty passwords to pass or closed the modal without explicit error on empty password (12:51:25 PM, 12:51:58 PM, 12:52:28 PM).
            *   **Significant Change (1/6/2026, 12:57:00 PM):** A `while(true)` loop was introduced within the `onPassword` callback. This loop repeatedly prompts the user for a non-empty password if they click "OK" with an empty input, or it closes the modal if the user cancels the prompt. This improves the robustness of password handling for encrypted PDFs. The content at 1:03:40 PM is identical to this.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\TDSATDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Updates between 1/6/2026, 1:12:41 PM and 1/6/2026, 1:15:44 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** This component displays detailed information for TDSAT cases, including cause list, proceedings, and orders. The `FileManager` component (presumably for case-related documents) was repeatedly commented out and then re-included, suggesting active testing or conditional rendering adjustments for the file management section within TDSAT case details.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple identical entries from 1/6/2026, 1:14:18 PM to 1/6/2026, 1:38:18 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** The code content remained consistent across these timestamps. This `FileManager` component specifically handles file uploads and downloads for "CASE_DOCUMENT" types. It uses S3 pre-signed URLs for efficient uploads, tracks upload progress with cancellation functionality, and manages file lists. It includes a `multiLevelPath` utility for directory paths.

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\SupremeCourtDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Two identical entries from 1/6/2026, 1:15:56 PM to 1/6/2026, 1:25:42 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** The code content remained consistent across these timestamps. This component displays Supreme Court case details, using a `useSupremeCourtDetails` hook. Similar to `TDSATDetails.jsx`, it includes the `FileManager` and `NotesManager` components within its structure, indicating integrated file and note management for Supreme Court cases.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 1/6/2026, 1:38:48 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** This is another `FileManager` component, distinct from the `case_status` one, and is tailored for "NOTICE_DOCUMENT" management. It shares core upload/download logic with the other file managers but incorporates Sentry for error reporting and explicitly defines a `Dropdown` menu for file and folder upload options. It includes a centralized `handleAxiosError` function.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent API Interaction:** All file management components communicate with a backend API at `${ROOT_URL}/upload_documents/` using `axios`, typically sending `document_for` (e.g., `CASE_DOCUMENT`, `NOTICE_DOCUMENT`, `EXPENSE_DOCUMENT`) and an entity ID. Authentication uses `Bearer` tokens obtained via `getValidAccessToken()`.
*   **Centralized Error Handling:** `message.error` and `console.error` are prevalent for user feedback and debugging. `handleAxiosError` is used across multiple file managers for consistent Axios error processing, with Sentry integration in `all_notices/FileManager.jsx` for enhanced error tracking.
*   **UI/UX Consistency:** Ant Design components (Modal, Dropdown, message, Pagination) are extensively used across all file-related components, ensuring a uniform look and feel. Custom UI components (Loader2, ConfirmationModal, FilePreviewModal, UploadProgressBar) are also reused.
*   **File Operations Standardization:** The core functionalities of uploading (single file, folders), downloading (single file, all files in a folder/case), deleting (single file, folders), and renaming files are implemented uniformly across relevant components.
*   **Web Event Tracking:** `trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED, ...)` is consistently employed for analytics on user interactions with file management features.
*   **Upload Management:** Components dealing with uploads implement progress tracking (`uploadStatus`), modal visibility (`isUploadModalVisible`), and cancellation logic (`AbortController`). A `isUploadingRef` is used to prevent concurrent uploads.
*   **Hierarchical Data Structures:** File managers for `all_notices` and `NewFileUploadGrid` use functions to build tree structures for organizing files and folders, enabling operations like calculating folder sizes and collecting files within a folder recursively.
*   **Dependency Management:** Monorepo paths like `@case-track-mono/Configs`, `@case-track-mono/Store`, and `@case-track-mono/Utils` indicate a structured project setup with shared utilities and configurations.

## 2:49:43 PM
The changes log details updates across three files, predominantly focusing on `components\_constants\about.ts`.

**Overall Summary:**
The log indicates initial setup and styling in `app\layout.tsx`, followed by numerous, rapid iterative changes to team and media testimonial data in `components\_constants\about.ts`, and minor structural edits in `components\About\TimeLine.tsx`. A key pattern observed is the repeated modification of team member details, including designations and image assignments, leading to several instances of image reuse and some potential inconsistencies.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`app\layout.tsx` (Timestamp: 1/5/2026, 4:25:09 PM):**
    *   This file defines the root layout for the Next.js application.
    *   It imports global CSS, favicon, Google Analytics, Cookie Banner, and a Loader component.
    *   Metadata for the site is set, including `title` as 'MikeLegal Services Private Limited', `description` as 'MikeLegal | AI-powered Legal Solutions', and `metadataBase` to `https://www.mikelegal.com/`. Favicon is explicitly linked.
    *   A local font (`SF-Pro-Display`) is configured with various weights.
    *   The `RootLayout` component includes an inline script to manage a page loader's fade-out and display removal after 1.5 seconds.
    *   Components like `<Loader />`, `<GoogleAnalytics />`, and `<CookieBanner />` are present but commented out within the `<body>`.

*   **`components\_constants\about.ts` (Multiple timestamps between 1/5/2026, 9:02:21 PM and 1/6/2026, 10:00:26 AM):**
    *   This file exports `mediaTestimonialData` (an array of media mentions) and `teamData` (an array of team members).
    *   **Rapid Iterative Changes:** This file experienced frequent modifications within a concentrated timeframe (approximately one hour) on 1/5/2026, indicating active development or data entry.
    *   **Team Data Updates:**
        *   Numerous team member designations were updated:
            *   `Gaurav Ashish`: 'Finance Controller' to 'Accounts Manager' (9:03:14 PM).
            *   `Mukesh Verma`: 'Data Support and Admin' to 'Data Entry and Support Specialist' (9:03:35 PM).
            *   `Sangita Sarkar`: 'Senior Legal-Tech Consultant - Sales' to 'Global Sales Executive' (9:04:17 PM).
            *   `Lakshmi Seetharaman`: 'Customer Success Executive' to 'Customer Success Manager' (9:05:33 PM).
            *   `Paula Ghose`'s entry was renamed to `Tanya Chaitanya Mishra` and her designation changed to 'Marketing Manager' (9:13:37 PM).
            *   `Akriti Garg`'s entry was effectively replaced by `Nitin Kumar Sharma` (designation initially 'Head Of Content & Communication', later 'LegalTech Consultant') (9:15:17 PM).
            *   `Shitika Bhagotia`'s entry designation changed to 'Senior Legal Associate', then its image was effectively used for `Ayush Chandra` (9:16:11 PM).
            *   `Nitin Sharma`'s original entry was replaced by `Gopal Krishna` (9:16:19 PM).
            *   `Anamika Singh Kant`'s designation changed from 'SDE Test' to 'SDET' (9:17:13 PM, and again at 9:47:05 PM).
            *   `Vishal Dhiman`: 'Engineering Manager (IPSuite)' to 'IT Product Manager' (9:33:54 PM).
            *   `Mohit Sharma`: 'Assistant Product Manager (IPSuite)' to 'Product Manager' (9:35:32 PM).
            *   `Aniket Rathore`: 'SDE II (Backend)' to 'Senior Backend Developer' (9:36:32 PM).
            *   `Rajnis Kumar`: 'SDE I (Backend)' to 'Backend Developer' (9:37:38 PM).
            *   `Abhishek Kathal`'s designation changed from 'SDE I (Backend)' to 'Senior Backend Developer' (1/6/2026, 10:00:26 AM, but also appears as 'SDE 1 Backend' at 9:38:18 PM).
            *   `Kritikalpa Saha`: 'SDE I (Frontend)' to 'Front End Developer' (9:43:55 PM).
            *   `Parth Prajapati`'s name was updated to `Parth Rasikbhai Prajapati` (9:44:23 PM).
        *   **Additions/Removals of Team Members:**
            *   `Monojit Das` was initially present, then commented out and fully removed, and later an entry for `Abhijeet Singh` (SDE II Frontend/SDE 1 Backend) was added using the `monojit` image (9:20:41 PM, 9:35:32 PM, 9:38:06 PM).
            *   `Aayushi Singh` was added as 'Legal Tech consultant' (9:15:54 PM).
            *   `Ayush Chandra` was added as 'Senior Legal Associate' (9:16:11 PM).
            *   `Gopal Krishna` was added as 'Legal Tech Consultant' (9:16:19 PM).
            *   `Priyanshu` (later `Priyanshu Maurya`) was added as 'SDE I (AI)' / 'SDE AI' (9:42:56 PM).
            *   `Sandip Saha` was added as 'SDE I (Frontend)' (9:44:55 PM).
            *   `Anuj Kumar` was added as 'SDE I (Frontend)' then 'SDE Test' (9:45:39 PM, 9:46:34 PM).
            *   `Sharvari Shashikant Kothawade` was added as 'SDE Test' / 'SDET' (9:47:46 PM).
            *   `Vijit Shrivastava` was removed (9:48:44 PM).
    *   **Image Path and Import Management Issues:** A significant pattern is the frequent reassignment of image paths within `teamData` and the removal of corresponding `import` statements.
        *   Multiple team members (e.g., `Tanya Chaitanya Mishra`, `Nitin Kumar Sharma`, `Aayushi Singh`, `Gopal Krishna`, `Ayush Chandra`, `Anweshak Sidharth`, `Priyanshu Maurya`, `Ammar Abdur Raheman`, `Salwyn Joseph Mathew`, `Sandip Saha`, `Anuj Kumar`, `Sharvari Shashikant Kothawade`) were at various points assigned the `angsuman` image (initially imported for `Angsuman Ray`). This led to the removal of several individual image imports (`paula`, `akriti`, `shitika`, `deeksha`, `nitin`, `anand`, `rohit`, `salwyn`).
        *   There is an inconsistency where the `shreyanshu` import is removed at 9:49:13 PM, but the `Shreyanshu Shekhar` entry in `teamData` still references `img: shreyanshu` in the final log entry for the file, which would cause a reference error if the import is truly gone.
    *   **Reordering:** Entries for `Gaurav Ashish` and `Mukesh Verma` were moved to the end of the `teamData` array (9:09:00 PM).

*   **`components\About\HeroSection.tsx` (Timestamp: 1/6/2026, 12:21:39 AM):**
    *   Introduces a hero section with company branding and a brief description.
    *   Features two "hero cards" for `Anshul Gupta` (CEO, Co-Founder) and `Tushar Bhargava` (CLO, Co-Founder).
    *   Each card displays an image, name, designation, LinkedIn link, and email link.
    *   A potential bug exists where `Tushar Bhargava`'s email link is incorrectly set to `anshul@mikelegal.com`.

*   **`components\About\TimeLine.tsx` (Multiple timestamps between 1/6/2026, 11:38:16 AM and 1/6/2026, 11:48:41 AM):**
    *   This component outlines the company's "About Us" section with a timeline image.
    *   A previously commented-out `h3` element was removed (11:38:23 AM).
    *   The component consistently contains a duplicate `<article>` section explaining the name 'MikeLegal', with minor styling adjustments to its margin (`mb-16` to `mb-32`, then inline `marginBottom: "40px"`) over time. The redundant content was not removed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **High Volatility in `about.ts`:** The `components\_constants\about.ts` file shows extremely frequent and granular updates, especially to the `teamData` array. This suggests ongoing, rapid iteration or correction of team member information.
*   **Image Management Challenges:** A significant recurring pattern in `about.ts` is the inconsistent handling of images. Many unique team member images were initially imported, but then several team members were reassigned to use the `angsuman` image. This led to the removal of unused imports, but also created potential issues if the original images were still intended for use or if a new image was not properly imported/assigned.
*   **Content Duplication:** The `components\About\TimeLine.tsx` file prominently features duplicated textual content about the company name's origin, which persists through all recorded changes for this file.

## 3:06:46 PM
The log entries primarily detail changes across several React components related to file and document management, notably focusing on upload, download, deletion, and preview functionalities within a `CaseTrack-frontend` application. All timestamps are consistent, dated 1/6/2026, which may be a placeholder or development environment setting.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`**
    *   Across multiple timestamps from **12:00:30 PM to 12:09:33 PM**, the code content remained identical. This component handles general file and folder uploads, downloads, renames, and deletions, featuring Redux integration for state management (e.g., `updateExpenseFiles`, `updatePaymentsReceivedFiles`). It uses `axios` for API calls, `antd` for UI elements, `JSZip` for folder zipping, and tracks web events. The stability of its code content across these logs suggests no functional changes were committed to this specific file during this period.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManagerGrid.jsx`**
    *   At **12:10:57 PM** and **12:11:08 PM**, the code content remained identical. This component is responsible for displaying and managing files in a grid format, including folder structure, size calculations, and actions like delete, rename, and download for notice-related documents. It interacts with the backend for file operations and uses Ant Design components.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\FilePreviewModal.jsx`**
    *   This file experienced the most active changes, primarily concerning PDF password handling:
        *   **12:34:45 PM:** Initial implementation for file preview, supporting images, PDFs, and Office documents via `iframe` and `react-pdf`. PDF password handling involved a simple `window.prompt`, closing the modal if the user cancelled or entered an empty password.
        *   **12:43:26 PM:** A significant, albeit temporary, refactor attempted to introduce more controlled PDF password input using Ant Design's `Input` and custom modal states (`passwordModalOpen`, `pdfPassword`, `passwordCallbackRef`), commenting out the old `window.prompt` approach.
        *   **12:45:04 PM:** The refactor was reverted, returning to the `window.prompt` logic from 12:34:45 PM.
        *   **12:50:36 PM - 12:52:28 PM:** Several minor iterations on the `onPassword` callback logic with `window.prompt`. These iterations adjusted how empty or cancelled password inputs were handled, sometimes leading to inconsistent user experience (e.g., not displaying an error message for an empty password or incorrectly closing the modal).
        *   **12:54:30 PM - 12:54:54 PM:** The `onPassword` logic stabilized, returning to the original behavior where cancelling or providing an empty password would close the preview modal.
        *   **12:57:00 PM - 1:03:40 PM:** The PDF password handling was refined to be more robust. It introduced a `while(true)` loop within the `onPassword` callback, forcing the user to either enter a non-empty password or explicitly cancel, which would then close the modal. This ensures a password is provided if required.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\TDSATDetails.jsx`**
    *   This component integrates various case details and managers. Its notable changes revolved around the inclusion of the `FileManager` component:
        *   **1:12:41 PM:** The `<FileManager />` component was commented out, temporarily removing its functionality from the TDSAT case details view.
        *   **1:13:12 PM:** The `<FileManager />` component was uncommented and restored.
        *   **1:15:44 PM:** The `<FileManager />` component was commented out again. This back-and-forth indicates active development, testing, or a decision process regarding whether to include a `FileManager` directly within the TDSAT details view.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\SupremeCourtDetails.jsx`**
    *   At **1:15:56 PM** and **1:25:42 PM**, the code content remained identical. This component, similar to `TDSATDetails.jsx`, displays court-specific case details, but consistently includes the `<FileManager />` component in its layout throughout these logs.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   Across multiple timestamps from **1:14:18 PM to 1:38:18 PM**, the code content remained identical. This `FileManager` component provides comprehensive file management for case documents, including S3 signed URL generation, multipart form data uploads with progress tracking, handling existing files (replace status), and directory uploads. It also supports downloading all files related to a case. No functional changes occurred in this file within the logged period.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   Only one entry at **1:38:48 PM**. This component offers similar file management features to its `case_status` counterpart, specifically for notice-related documents. It includes error handling with Sentry and detailed logic for file and directory uploads, signed URL generation, and progress tracking.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent File Management Architecture:** Multiple components (`NewFileUploadGrid`, `FileManager` in `case_status`, `FileManager` in `all_notices`) share a common pattern for handling file operations:
    *   Utilizing `axios` for robust HTTP requests, often with authorization headers (`Bearer ${await getValidAccessToken()}`).
    *   Interacting with a `ROOT_URL/upload_documents/` endpoint for various operations (`DATA`, `DOWNLOAD`, `ADD`, `S3_SIGNED_URL`, `DELETE`, `RENAME`).
    *   Implementing file and folder upload mechanisms, including progress tracking (`UploadProgressBar`) and handling for existing files.
    *   Providing download, rename, and delete functionalities, often with confirmation modals.
    *   Using `message` from Ant Design for user feedback.
    *   Tracking web events (`trackWeb`, `EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED`) for analytics.
    *   `useRef` is frequently used to manage file input elements and abort controllers for uploads.
*   **Modular UI Components:** The application relies heavily on modular React components (e.g., `ConfirmationModal`, `FilePreviewModal`, `Loader2`, `TagList`, `ShowMoreItems`, `StatusTable`).
*   **Redux Integration:** Several components (`NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`, `FileManager.jsx`) use `react-redux` (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) for state management, particularly for storing file data and user information.
*   **Error Handling:** A consistent `handleAxiosError` function is used across `FileManager` components to centralize error reporting (including Sentry) and user notifications.
*   **PDF Viewing:** `FilePreviewModal.jsx` demonstrates a dedicated effort to improve the user experience for viewing password-protected PDFs, evolving from basic `window.prompt` to a more robust looping prompt mechanism.
*   **Conditional Component Rendering:** The `TDSATDetails.jsx` file shows dynamic inclusion/exclusion of the `FileManager` component, suggesting a feature toggle or ongoing design decisions.
*   **No sensitive information (keys/env files) were found or summarized.**

## 3:49:27 PM
The code changes primarily involve updates to a Next.js web application, focusing on the main layout and a constant file for "About Us" page data.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\layout.tsx` (Timestamp: 1/5/2026, 4:25:09 PM):**
    *   This file defines the root layout for the Next.js application.
    *   It imports global CSS, a favicon, Google Analytics, Cookie Banner, Next.js Metadata, and a custom local font (`SF-Pro-Display`).
    *   Metadata for the site (`title`, `description`, `metadataBase`, `icons`) is configured, setting the title to "MikeLegal Services Private Limited" and description to "MikeLegal | AI-powered Legal Solutions".
    *   A custom `sf_pro` local font is loaded with different weights, referencing OTF font files from `public/fonts`.
    *   An inline JavaScript snippet is added to the `<head>` section. This script implements a delayed fade-out effect for a `.page-loader` element, setting its opacity to 0 over 1 second after an initial 1.5-second delay, and then hiding it.
    *   `Loader`, `GoogleAnalytics`, and `CookieBanner` components are imported but commented out within the `<body>`, suggesting they are temporarily disabled or pending activation.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\about.ts` (Multiple timestamps from 1/5/2026, 9:02:21 PM to 9:50:50 PM):**
    *   This file acts as a central data store (`_constants`) for the "About Us" page, holding information for media testimonials and team members.
    *   It imports a large number of `.webp` image assets from `public/assets/About/` and `public/assets/MediaMensions/`.
    *   The `mediaTestimonialData` array, which lists various press mentions and their details (id, image, link, publisher, text), remains largely consistent across all log entries for this file.
    *   The `teamData` array, containing team members' `tabkey`, `name`, `designation`, and `img` (image reference), undergoes numerous rapid changes:
        *   **Initial state (9:02:21 PM)** contains a diverse team list with various roles.
        *   **Designation Updates:** Several team member designations are updated, such as "Gaurav Ashish" from 'Finance Controller' to 'Accounts Manager' (9:03:14 PM), "Mukesh Verma" from 'Data Support and Admin' to 'Data Entry and Support Specialist' (9:03:35 PM), "Lakshmi Seetharaman" from 'Customer Success Executive' to 'Customer Success Manager' (9:05:33 PM), "Vishal Dhiman" to 'IT Product Manager' (9:33:54 PM), "Mohit Sharma" to 'Product Manager' (9:35:32 PM), "Aniket Rathore" to 'Senior Backend Developer' (9:36:32 PM), "Rajnis Kumar" to 'Backend Developer' (9:37:38 PM), "Kriti Kalpa Saha" to 'Front End Developer' (9:43:55 PM), and "Anamika Singh Kant" to 'SDET' (9:46:34 PM and 9:48:03 PM, with a brief reversion).
        *   **Name Changes:** "Paula Ghose" is changed to "Tanya Chaitanya Mishra" (9:13:37 PM), "Akriti Garg" to "Nitin Kumar Sharma" (9:15:17 PM), "Deeksha Jaiswal" to "Aayushi Singh" (9:15:54 PM), "Nitin Sharma" to "Gopal Krishna" (9:16:11 PM), "Shitika Bhagotia" to "Ayush Chandra" (9:16:11 PM), "Rohit Pal" to "Rohit Singh Pal" (9:38:55 PM), and "Parth Prajapati" to "Parth Rasikbhai Prajapati" (9:44:23 PM).
        *   **New Team Members Added:** "Abhijeet Singh" (SDE 1 Backend) (9:38:06 PM), "Ammar Abdur Raheman" (SDE 1 (Backend)) (9:40:10 PM), "Salwyn Joseph Mathew" (SDE I AI) (9:41:24 PM), "Priyanshu Maurya" (SDE I (AI)) (9:42:56 PM), "Sandip Saha" (SDE I (Frontend)) (9:44:55 PM), and "Anuj Kumar" (SDE Test) (9:45:39 PM), "Sharvari Shashikant Kothawade" (SDET) (9:47:46 PM).
        *   **Image Assignments:** A notable pattern is the frequent re-assignment of `img` properties for several team members to `angsuman` (e.g., for `Tanya Chaitanya Mishra`, `Nitin Kumar Sharma`, `Aayushi Singh`, `Gopal Krishna`, `Ayush Chandra`, `Priyanshu Maurya`, `Sandip Saha`, `Anuj Kumar`, `Sharvari Shashikant Kothawade`). This suggests the use of a placeholder image or a temporary bulk change. Some original image imports are removed when their corresponding team member entries are modified or their `img` field is changed.
        *   **Reordering and Commenting:** Some entries are reordered or temporarily commented out and then restored.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\About\HeroSection.tsx` (Timestamp: 1/6/2026, 12:21:39 AM):**
    *   This component defines the hero section for the "About" page.
    *   It imports local CSS, Next.js `Image` component, specific hero images for "Anshul" and "Tushar," a LinkedIn icon, and `next/link`.
    *   It displays a main heading "We are MikeLegal" and a tagline.
    *   It features two profile cards for the co-founders, "Anshul Gupta" (CEO, Co-Founder) and "Tushar Bhargava" (CLO, Co-Founder), including their images, names, designations, LinkedIn links, and email links. There's a minor error where both email links initially point to `anshul@mikelegal.com`.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\About\TimeLine.tsx` (Multiple timestamps from 1/6/2026, 11:38:16 AM to 11:48:41 AM):**
    *   This component provides the "About Us" section with a timeline.
    *   It imports local CSS and a timeline image (`timeline.png`), with a responsive source for mobile.
    *   It includes a general description of MikeLegal's purpose.
    *   It features a section explaining the company name, "MikeLegal," inspired by the TV show 'Suits'.
    *   **Content Refinement:** An initial descriptive paragraph ("It all began...") is commented out (11:38:23 AM).
    *   **Structural Redundancy & Styling:** A duplicate "And what's with the name..." article is temporarily added (11:39:20 AM). Styling adjustments are made to the margin-bottom of this section, changing from `mb-16` to `mb-32` and then to an inline `style={{marginBottom: "40px"}}` (11:39:40 AM, 11:40:14 AM, 11:48:41 AM). The duplicate article is eventually removed.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **January 5, 2026, 4:25:09 PM:** Initial setup of the root `layout.tsx` with metadata, custom fonts, and a loader script.
*   **January 5, 2026, 9:02:21 PM - 9:50:50 PM:** A concentrated period of frequent updates (many within seconds/minutes) to the `about.ts` file, primarily adjusting team member designations, names, and adding new members.
*   **January 6, 2026, 12:21:39 AM:** Creation of the `HeroSection.tsx` component with co-founder profiles.
*   **January 6, 2026, 11:38:16 AM - 11:48:41 AM:** A series of minor content and styling adjustments to the `TimeLine.tsx` component, including commenting out text and refining margins.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration on `about.ts`:** The `about.ts` file experienced numerous very small, sequential changes, suggesting active and granular updates to the team directory, possibly during an onboarding or profile review phase.
*   **Image Path Consistency:** Image imports consistently use `../../public/assets/About/` and `../../public/assets/MediaMensions/`.
*   **Team Data Structure:** The `teamData` array consistently uses `tabkey`, `name`, `designation`, and `img` for each team member.
*   **Placeholder Image Usage:** A recurring pattern in `about.ts` is the temporary or possibly erroneous assignment of `img: angsuman` (CTO's image) to multiple other team members' entries, indicating a placeholder might have been used during updates, or image assets for new members were not yet finalized.
*   **Styling via CSS Modules and Inline Styles:** Both CSS module imports (e.g., `styles.hero_section`) and inline style objects (e.g., `style={{ maxWidth: '250px', height: 'auto' }}`, `style={{marginBottom: "40px"}}`) are used for styling.
*   **Next.js Features:** The project utilizes core Next.js features like app router (`layout.tsx`), image optimization (`next/image`), and local font loading (`next/font/local`).
*   **Code Commenting:** Components or sections are sometimes commented out (e.g., `Loader`, `GoogleAnalytics`, `CookieBanner` in `layout.tsx`; a descriptive paragraph in `TimeLine.tsx`), implying ongoing development or feature toggling.

## 4:06:54 PM
Across the provided log entries, the majority of changes for a given file appear to be identical code commits within a short timeframe, suggesting frequent saves or minor non-functional alterations rather than distinct functional updates between each timestamp. However, specific functional changes and patterns can be identified.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 1/6/2026, 12:00:30 PM to 1/6/2026, 12:09:33 PM.
    *   **Key Information:** This React component is responsible for a comprehensive file and folder management system. It integrates with Redux (`updateExpenseFiles`, `updatePaymentsReceivedFiles`, `updateTimeSheetLogFiles`, `updateTaskFiles`) for state management, uses Ant Design for UI, and `axios` for API interactions (download, delete, rename). It supports both file and folder uploads, tracks upload status, and provides modals for confirmation, preview, and renaming. Despite the numerous log entries, the code content for this file remains consistently the same, indicating no functional changes within this period.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManagerGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/6/2026, 12:10:57 PM and 1/6/2026, 12:11:08 PM.
    *   **Key Information:** This component displays a file manager grid specifically for "notice documents". It includes logic for building a file/folder tree structure, calculating folder sizes, and handling delete, rename, and download operations. It also utilizes `JSZip` for folder downloads. The code is identical across both timestamps.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\FilePreviewModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 1/6/2026, 12:34:45 PM to 1/6/2026, 1:03:40 PM.
    *   **Key Information:** This file underwent the most significant and iterative changes.
        *   **Initial Implementation (12:34 PM):** Introduced functionality to preview various file types (PDF, image, office documents via iframe) and included a basic `window.prompt` for password-protected PDFs. If a password was not provided or canceled, it would show an error and prevent modal closure.
        *   **Attempted Refactor (12:43 PM):** A brief, commented-out section showed an attempt to implement a custom password input modal instead of `window.prompt`. This was not fully realized and immediately superseded.
        *   **Iterative Password Handling Refinement (12:45 PM - 1:03 PM):** The subsequent changes focused heavily on refining the `onPassword` callback for `react-pdf` using `window.prompt`. This involved several modifications to improve user experience when dealing with password-protected PDFs:
            *   Ensuring the modal closes correctly if the user cancels the password prompt (`pwd === null`).
            *   Implementing a `while (true)` loop to re-prompt the user if an empty password is submitted, preventing progression with invalid input without explicitly showing an Ant Design message.
            *   Reverting conflicting changes that would incorrectly close the modal or pass empty passwords.
        The overall pattern shows a dedicated effort to make the PDF password handling robust and user-friendly.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\TDSATDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/6/2026, 1:12:41 PM, 1:13:12 PM, and 1:15:44 PM.
    *   **Key Information:** This component displays details for TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal) cases. The primary change pattern here is the repeated toggling of the `FileManager` component's rendering within the `content-manager-root-container`. It was initially commented out, then uncommented (activated), and finally commented out again, suggesting ongoing development or a decision process regarding its integration into this specific court detail view. The `NotesManager` component was uncommented and remained active after the 1:13 PM timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\SupremeCourtDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/6/2026, 1:15:56 PM and 1/6/2026, 1:25:42 PM.
    *   **Key Information:** This component renders Supreme Court case details. It consistently includes both `FileManager` and `NotesManager` components. No functional changes are observed between these timestamps.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 1/6/2026, 1:14:18 PM to 1/6/2026, 1:38:18 PM.
    *   **Key Information:** This `FileManager` component is designed for general "case documents." It handles fetching documents, uploading files and folders (using S3 pre-signed URLs, managing progress, re-upload, and cancellation with `AbortController`), and provides a "Download All" feature. Despite many log entries, the code content for this file remains consistently the same, indicating no functional changes within this period.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 1/6/2026, 1:38:48 PM.
    *   **Key Information:** This entry introduces a distinct `FileManager` component specifically for "notice documents." It largely duplicates the functionality found in `case_status/FileManager.jsx` but includes explicit Sentry error reporting and a more detailed `handleAxiosError` function. This indicates a separation of file management concerns based on the document type, with specific error handling for notice-related files.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Consistent File Management Features:** Across multiple `FileManager` and `FileUploadGrid` components, there's a recurring need for robust file operations: upload, download, delete, rename, and preview. This functionality is implemented with shared patterns like using `axios` for API calls, `getValidAccessToken()` for authorization, and Ant Design `message` for user feedback.
2.  **Monorepo Utilities:** The use of `@case-track-mono/Configs`, `@case-track-mono/Store`, and `@case-track-mono/Utils` indicates a monorepo architecture, promoting code reuse and standardized practices (e.g., `ROOT_URL`, Redux actions, `trackWeb` for analytics, `getValidAccessToken`).
3.  **UI Framework Preference:** Ant Design is the primary UI library, used for components like `message`, `Modal`, `Dropdown`, and `Pagination`.
4.  **React Hooks Usage:** `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useMemo` are fundamental to managing component state, side effects, and performance optimization.
5.  **Modular Component Design:** Logic is encapsulated into reusable components (e.g., `CaseDetails`, `StatusTable`, `NotesManager`, `FileManagerGrid`).
6.  **S3 Integration:** File uploads often involve obtaining S3 pre-signed URLs and handling multipart form data uploads, complete with progress tracking and cancellation capabilities.
7.  **PDF Handling:** `react-pdf` is specifically used for PDF previews, with dedicated logic for managing password protection.
8.  **Redundant Saves:** A prominent pattern is the frequent saving of identical code, particularly evident in `NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`, `FileManager.jsx` (case_status), and `SupremeCourtDetails.jsx`. This suggests active development environment where files are saved often without substantial code changes between commits.

## 4:49:42 PM
The log details changes across two main files: `app/layout.tsx` and `components/_constants/about.ts`, with a minor update to `components/About/HeroSection.tsx` and some duplication in `components/About/TimeLine.tsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\layout.tsx` (Timestamp: 1/5/2026, 4:25:09 PM):**
    *   The global CSS import path was updated.
    *   Metadata was refined, setting the title to 'MikeLegal Services Private Limited', description to 'MikeLegal | AI-powered Legal Solutions', and establishing `metadataBase` to `https://www.mikelegal.com/` with a `/favicon.ico` icon.
    *   A custom `localFont` (`sf_pro`) was implemented, loading multiple font weights (400, 500, 600, 700) from `public/fonts/SF-Pro-Display-*.otf`.
    *   An inline JavaScript snippet was added to the `<head>` to manage a loading animation: it delays a fade-out effect for an element with class `.page-loader` after 1.5 seconds, then hides it completely after another 1 second.
    *   Components like `Loader`, `GoogleAnalytics`, and `CookieBanner` are commented out in the `<body>` of the `RootLayout`, suggesting they are either temporarily disabled or were being considered for removal/refactoring.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\about.ts` (Multiple timestamps between 1/5/2026, 9:02:21 PM and 9:50:50 PM):**
    This file saw frequent updates, primarily focused on refining the `teamData` array, which lists employees with their `tabkey` (role category), `name`, `designation`, and `img` (image reference).
    *   **Designation Updates:**
        *   `Gaurav Ashish`: `Finance Controller` changed to `Accounts Manager`.
        *   `Mukesh Verma`: `Data Support and Admin` changed to `Data Entry and Support Specialist`.
        *   `Sangita Sarkar`: `Senior Legal-Tech Consultant - Sales` changed to `Global Sales Executive`.
        *   `Lakshmi Seetharaman`: `Customer Success Executive` changed to `Customer Success Manager`.
        *   `Vishal Dhiman`: `Engineering Manager (IPSuite)` changed to `IT Product Manager`.
        *   `Mohit Sharma`: `Assistant Product Manager (IPSuite)` changed to `Product Manager`.
        *   `Aniket Rathore`: `SDE II (Backend)` changed to `Senior Backend Developer`.
        *   `Abhishek Kathal`: `SDE I (Backend)` changed to `Senior Backend Developer`.
        *   `Rajnis Kumar`: `SDE I (Backend)` changed to `Backend Developer`.
        *   `Anamika Singh`: `SDE Test` changed to `SDET`, then to `Anamika Singh Kant` as `SDET`.
    *   **Personnel Changes and Re-assignments (often with image reuse):**
        *   `Paula Ghose` (`Sr. Legal Tech Consultant`) was replaced by `Tanya Chaitanya Mishra` (`Marketing Manager`), initially reusing `img: paula`, later updated to `img: angsuman`.
        *   `Akriti Garg` (`Head Of Content & Communication`) was replaced by `Nitin Kumar Sharma` with the same role, initially reusing `img: akriti`, later updated to `LegalTech Consultant` and `img: angsuman`.
        *   `Deeksha Jaiswal` (`Legal Tech consultant`) was replaced by `Aayushi Singh` (`LegalTech Consultant`), initially reusing `img: deeksha`, later updated to `img: angsuman`.
        *   `Shitika Bhagotia` (`Legal Tech Consultant`) was replaced by `Ayush Chandra` (`Senior Legal Associate`), initially reusing `img: shitika`, later updated to `img: angsuman`.
        *   `Nitin Sharma` (`Legal Tech Consultant`) was replaced by `Gopal Krishna` (`LegalTech Consultant`), initially reusing `img: nitin`, later updated to `img: angsuman`.
        *   `Monojit Das` (`SDE II (Frontend)`) was commented out, then effectively replaced by `Abhijeet Singh` (`SDE 1 Backend`), initially reusing `img: monojit`, later updated to `img: angsuman`.
    *   **New Team Members Added (with image reuse):**
        *   `Priyanshu Maurya` (SDE I (AI)) using `img: salwyn`.
        *   `Sandip Saha` (SDE I (Frontend)) using `img: angsuman`.
        *   `Anuj Kumar` (SDE Test) using `img: angsuman`.
        *   `Sharvari Shashikant Kothawade` (SDET) using `img: angsuman`.
    *   **Typo Corrections:** `Rohit Pal` was briefly changed to `Rohit Pa` before being corrected to `Rohit Singh Pal`.
    *   **Image Management:** Several specific image imports (e.g., `akriti`, `paula`, `deeksha`, `shitika`, `nitin`, `anand`, `shreyanshu`, `monojit`, `rohit`) were removed from the import list, and their corresponding `img` references in `teamData` were largely consolidated to `angsuman`. This indicates a significant shift in how employee images are managed, possibly moving towards a generic placeholder or a different asset loading strategy. One exception is `Salwyn Joseph Mathew` who uses `salwyn`.
    *   Some entries were reordered within the `teamData` array, particularly in the Sales & Marketing and Engineering sections.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\About\HeroSection.tsx` (Timestamp: 1/6/2026, 12:21:39 AM):**
    *   The `CLO, Co-Founder` entry for `Tushar Bhargava` contains a minor bug in the initial log where the displayed email text is `tushar@mikelegal.com` but the `mailto` link's `href` is `anshul@mikelegal.com`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\About\TimeLine.tsx` (Multiple timestamps between 1/6/2026, 11:38:16 AM and 1/6/2026, 11:48:41 AM):**
    *   An introductory paragraph ("It all began with the idea...") in the "About Us" section was commented out.
    *   A complete `<article>` block explaining the origin of the "MikeLegal" name was accidentally duplicated. Subsequent changes involved modifying CSS classes (`mb-16`, `mb-32`) and adding inline styling (`marginBottom: "40px"`) to the duplicated block, rather than removing it or merging the content.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/5/2026, 4:25:09 PM:** Major structural updates to `app/layout.tsx`, including metadata, custom font loading, and a client-side loader script.
*   **1/5/2026, 9:02 PM - 9:17 PM:** Initial round of `teamData` updates in `components/_constants/about.ts`, focusing on role adjustments and early personnel changes.
*   **1/5/2026, 9:19 PM - 9:22 PM:** A significant batch of changes in `components/_constants/about.ts` where many individual image imports were removed, and several team members' `img` properties were standardized to `angsuman`, indicating an image asset consolidation effort.
*   **1/5/2026, 9:33 PM - 9:48 PM:** Further intensive modifications to `teamData` in `components/_constants/about.ts`, including more designation changes, new hires, and typo corrections.
*   **1/6/2026, 11:38 AM - 11:48 AM:** Content and structural adjustments in `components/About/TimeLine.tsx`, notably commenting out a text block and duplicating an entire section, suggesting ongoing content refinement and potential refactoring errors.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent granular updates:** The `about.ts` file experienced numerous commits within a short timeframe, indicating iterative changes to team details.
*   **Personnel and Role Management:** A recurring theme in `about.ts` is the updating of team members' designations, replacement of individuals in roles (sometimes with image reuse from the previous person or a generic placeholder), and the addition of new hires.
*   **Image Consolidation:** There's a clear pattern in `about.ts` of streamlining image references by removing specific imports and assigning a generic `angsuman` image to multiple team members, likely as placeholders or a simplification strategy.
*   **Content Duplication/Commenting:** In `TimeLine.tsx`, a content block was commented out, and another section was duplicated, suggesting ongoing content editing and potential issues in managing repeated content.
*   **Next.js specific features:** The use of `next/image`, `next/font/local`, `Metadata`, and `app/layout.tsx` structure highlights a Next.js application.
*   **MikeLegal branding and mission:** Consistent use of "MikeLegal" in titles and descriptions, and the specific narrative in `TimeLine.tsx` about the company's name origin (inspired by 'Suits'), reinforce the company's identity and vision.
