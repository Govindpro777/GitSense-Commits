# Activity Summary for 1/11/2026

## 1:41:13 PM
The code changes primarily focus on styling and data management for "About" sections, specifically concerning "Our Approach" and "Media Mentions" components. The modifications occurred rapidly on January 9, 2026, suggesting an intensive period of UI/UX refinement and data population.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\About\approach.module.css`**:
    *   **Early Morning (9:57 AM - 10:01 AM):** Initial CSS for `.approach_section` and its children was defined. Styles for `.approach_section_inner .title` were commented out and eventually removed, shifting title styling responsibility elsewhere.
    *   **Mid-Morning (10:02 AM - 10:08 AM):** The dimensions of `.principle_icon` were increased from `80px` to `110px`, then to `120px` (with responsive sizes updating from `60px` to `80px`). The `font-size` for `.principle_item p` was gradually increased from `1.1rem` to `20px`, then `24px`, and finally `26px`. `font-weight` and `color` properties for this paragraph were commented out or removed.
    *   **Late Morning (10:55 AM):** Responsive `font-size` for `.principle_item p` was introduced within the `max-width: 700px` media query, initially mirroring the larger screen size, then adjusted to `20px` for smaller screens.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\About\OurApproach.tsx`**:
    *   **Mid-Morning (10:00 AM - 10:01 AM):** The bottom margin (`mb-`) of the main `<h1>` title was progressively increased from `mb-16` to `mb-24`, then `mb-32`.
    *   **Mid-Morning (10:03 AM - 10:05 AM):** Inline `fs-` classes were added to paragraph elements within `.principle_item`, explicitly setting their font size to `fs-20` for the first item, then `fs-28` for the first two items.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\about.ts`**:
    *   **Late Morning (11:08 AM - 11:25 AM):** Multiple new image imports for team members (e.g., `anuj`, `abhijit`) were added. A specific correction was made where `abhijit` was renamed to `abhijeet` and then correctly assigned to `Abhijeet Singh`'s `img` property, replacing a placeholder.
    *   **Afternoon (2:05 PM - 6:12 PM):** The `Tanya Chaitanya Mishra` entry in `teamData` was commented out, then uncommented with its `img` property commented, and finally assigned a new `noname` image import (whose path was updated from `.webp` to `.png`). This entry was also moved to the end of the `teamData` array. Additionally, `Sharvari Shashikant Kothawade`'s image was updated to use the `noname` image.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\About\media.module.css`**:
    *   **Late Morning (11:37 AM - 11:39 AM):** The padding for `.media_section` and the `max-width` and `padding` for `.media_section_inner` underwent several adjustments, ranging between `1300px`, `1330px`, `1360px` for `max-width` and `2rem`, `2.5rem`, `2.8rem` for `padding`, suggesting layout experimentation.
    *   **Late Morning (12:03 PM):** New custom styles (`.custom_arrow`, `.custom_arrow:hover`, `.arrow_icon`, and `slick-prev/next:before` overrides) were added, indicating an effort to introduce more visually appealing and interactive navigation arrows for a slider component.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\About\MediaTestimonial.tsx`**:
    *   **Late Morning (11:41 AM - 11:50 AM):** The positioning of the `SampleNextArrow` and `SamplePrevArrow` components was repeatedly adjusted, specifically their `right` and `left` properties, to fine-tune their placement within the slider.
    *   **Late Morning (12:03 PM - 12:05 PM):** The component was temporarily commented out, then restored. Significant styling was added to `SamplePrevArrow` and `SampleNextArrow` to use flexbox for centering, including `display: 'flex'`, `alignItems: 'center'`, `justifyContent: 'center'`, `top: '50%'`, and `transform: 'translateY(-50%)'`, before these detailed centering styles were reverted to a simpler state.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/9/2026, 10:01:40 AM:** Removal of `.approach_section_inner .title` styles, delegating styling to utility classes or parent elements.
*   **1/9/2026, 10:02:37 AM:** First major increase in icon size (`.principle_icon`).
*   **1/9/2026, 10:05:35 AM - 10:08:07 AM:** Sequential adjustments to paragraph font sizes and removal of other text styles in `approach.module.css`.
*   **1/9/2026, 11:24:54 AM:** Correction of team member image assignment (`Abhijeet Singh` to `abhijeet.webp`).
*   **1/9/2026, 12:03:00 PM:** Addition of comprehensive custom arrow styles in `media.module.css`, indicating a new design direction for slider navigation.
*   **1/9/2026, 12:03:50 PM:** Major refactoring of slider arrow positioning in `MediaTestimonial.tsx` using flexbox for centering, though this was soon reverted.
*   **1/9/2026, 6:09:40 PM - 6:12:21 PM:** Refinement of team data with new image imports and corrections for placeholder images.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Styling Adjustments:** There's a clear pattern of small, consecutive changes to CSS properties (e.g., margins, paddings, font sizes, element dimensions, arrow positions) and inline styles, indicative of fine-tuning the visual presentation of components.
*   **Component-Driven Development:** Changes are compartmentalized within specific module CSS files and React components, suggesting a modular approach to front-end development.
*   **Asset Management and Data Refinement:** The `_constants\about.ts` file consistently shows updates related to importing image assets and refining data structures for team members and media mentions, including corrections to image paths and assignments.
*   **Slider Customization:** Both `media.module.css` and `MediaTestimonial.tsx` demonstrate a focused effort on customizing the appearance and functionality of the `react-slick` carousel, particularly for its navigation arrows.
*   **Frequent Saves/Minor Changes:** Several timestamps show almost identical code, suggesting frequent saves during development, or very minor, unlogged changes not visible in the provided diffs.
