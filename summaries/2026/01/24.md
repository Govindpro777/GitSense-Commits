# Activity Summary for 1/24/2026

## 5:05:40 PM
The main application setup file, `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\main.tsx`, underwent several updates. The initial significant change occurred on `1/23/2026, 5:34:25 PM`, establishing the core frontend application. This setup includes importing various libraries like React, ReactDOM, React Router, Redux, Apollo Client, Axios, and Sentry. It initializes a Redux store, Apollo client, and configures routing. Crucially, it sets up Axios interceptors for `axiosDocChatInstance`, `axiosInstance`, and the default `axios` to automatically inject an `Authorization` header with a valid access token for outgoing requests. A global Axios response interceptor is also implemented to catch `401` (Unauthorized) errors and redirect the user to the login page via `authService.redirectToLogin()`. The application's root component renders an `AuthInitializer`, `RouterProvider`, and is wrapped with `Sentry.ErrorBoundary` for error tracking, a Redux `Provider`, `ApolloProvider`, and React `StrictMode`.

A subsequent, minor update to `main.tsx` at `1/23/2026, 5:34:58 PM` involved only reordering the configuration of the `axiosInstance` and `axiosDocChatInstance` request interceptors, with no functional change to their logic. The file remained consistent in content in a later log entry at `1/23/2026, 5:53:51 PM`.

Separately, the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\utils\hooks\AllContracts\useFile\useFileManager.ts` was updated at `1/23/2026, 5:53:34 PM` to contain only a comment: `// i will use it later`, indicating a planned future implementation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Axios Interceptor Configuration:** A consistent pattern in `main.tsx` is the robust setup of Axios request interceptors across multiple Axios instances (`axiosDocChatInstance`, `axiosInstance`) to ensure all API calls include an authorization token. The global response interceptor for handling `401` errors is also consistently applied.
*   **Application Initialization Structure:** The core rendering structure within `main.tsx`, involving `StrictMode`, `ApolloProvider`, `Redux Provider`, `Sentry.ErrorBoundary`, `AuthInitializer`, and `RouterProvider`, remains unchanged across all updates, indicating a stable foundational setup.
*   **Minor, Non-functional Changes:** The changes to `main.tsx` after its initial comprehensive setup were very minor reordering of code, suggesting refinement rather than significant feature development during these specific timestamps. The update to `useFileManager.ts` was also non-functional, a placeholder comment.
