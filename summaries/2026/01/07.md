# Activity Summary for 1/7/2026

## 1:33:16 PM
The provided log details changes across several JavaScript/JSX files, primarily focusing on file management, uploads, downloads, and previews within a frontend application.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/6/2026, 12:00:30 PM` and `1/7/2026, 11:55:52 AM`.
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   Initial versions show a standard file upload/delete/rename grid component.
        *   The `handleFolderDelete` function was improved to iterate through all files within a folder and delete them individually, then refetch data and provide status messages (success/warning for partial failure).
        *   New state `folderLoading` was introduced around `1/7/2026, 10:38:43 AM` to manage loading states specifically for folder operations.
        *   The `useCreateFileUploadUtils` hook was updated around `1/7/2026, 11:55:19 AM` to also destructure `setUploadStatus`, indicating a change in how the upload progress state is managed, likely allowing the `UploadProgressBar` to directly reset or modify its status.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManagerGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/6/2026, 12:10:57 PM` and `1/7/2026, 1:32:43 PM`.
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   This component manages files specifically for "NOTICE_DOCUMENT" types. It includes functionality for deleting individual files and entire folders, renaming files, and downloading files/folders (zipped).
        *   `parseSizeToBytes` and `formatBytes` utility functions are present for handling file sizes.
        *   A `calculateFolderSizeBytes` recursive function helps in determining folder sizes.
        *   Around `1/7/2026, 10:22:00 AM`, a new state `folderLoading` was introduced to manage loading indicators for folder-specific actions (e.g., during folder downloads).
        *   Extensive commenting out of the entire file's content occurred at `1/6/2026, 5:59:40 PM` and `1/7/2026, 9:54:05 AM`, suggesting temporary disabling or testing, but then restored by `1/7/2026, 10:22:00 AM`.
        *   At `1/7/2026, 1:32:08 PM` and `1/7/2026, 1:32:43 PM`, commented-out code for `handleDeleteSubmit` and `closeModal` was removed, indicating a cleanup or refactoring, specifically in `closeModal` to potentially abort ongoing folder delete operations using `deleteAbortController` (though `deleteAbortController` itself isn't shown being defined in the provided snippets).

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\FilePreviewModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/6/2026, 12:34:45 PM` and `1/6/2026, 1:03:40 PM`.
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   This component handles file previews for various types (PDF, image, docviewer).
        *   A significant change occurred around `1/6/2026, 12:43:26 PM` where the component was almost entirely commented out, then re-implemented with a different approach for password-protected PDFs. The re-implementation introduced `passwordModalOpen`, `pdfPassword`, and `passwordCallbackRef` states/refs, suggesting an intention to use a custom modal for password input instead of `window.prompt`.
        *   However, subsequent commits (`1/6/2026, 12:45:04 PM` to `1/6/2026, 1:03:40 PM`) reverted this to use `window.prompt` again but refined the logic to handle empty password inputs and user cancellations:
            *   Initially, `if (!pwd)` would show an error and `return; // ✅ DO NOT close modal`.
            *   Later, this was changed to `if (pwd === null) { setFileUrl(null); onClose?.(); return; }` to handle cancellation by closing the modal.
            *   Further refinement introduced a `while(true)` loop to repeatedly prompt for a password until a non-empty string is provided or the user cancels, ensuring a valid password is given.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\TDSATDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes between `1/6/2026, 1:12:41 PM` and `1/6/2026, 1:15:44 PM`.
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   This component displays TDSAT case details, including status, notes, and file management.
        *   At `1/6/2026, 1:15:44 PM`, the `FileManager` component was commented out from rendering (`{/* <FileManager /> */}`), suggesting it might be temporarily disabled or its functionality is being integrated differently.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/6/2026, 1:14:18 PM` and `1/7/2026, 10:54:25 AM`.
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   Manages file operations (upload, download, cancel, re-upload) for "CASE_DOCUMENT" types. It interacts with S3 for signed URLs.
        *   Includes a `multiLevelPath` function for handling file paths, truncating if too deep.
        *   Introduced `isUploadingRef` to prevent multiple simultaneous upload operations.
        *   The logic for handling duplicate files during upload (setting status to "Replace") is present.
        *   Several large blocks of code for `handleFileChange` and `handleDirectoryInputChange` were commented out and then restored (`1/7/2026, 10:15:29 AM` and `1/7/2026, 10:21:18 AM`), indicating active development and testing of file upload mechanisms. The restored versions appear largely identical to previous working versions.

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\SupremeCourtDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes between `1/6/2026, 1:15:56 PM` and `1/6/2026, 1:25:42 PM`.
    *   **Key Updates:** No significant changes in the provided logs for this file, just two identical entries, implying either no changes or restoration of previous state. It continues to render `FileManager` and `NotesManager`.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes between `1/6/2026, 1:38:48 PM` and `1/7/2026, 11:23:02 AM`.
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   Similar to `case_status/FileManager.jsx`, this component handles file management for "NOTICE_DOCUMENT" types.
        *   It integrates Sentry for error tracking.
        *   The `handleAxiosError` function is explicitly defined here for consistent error handling.
        *   At `1/7/2026, 5:18:20 PM`, `fileListRef.current = newFileList;` was added inside the `if (newFileList.length > 0)` block of `handleFileChange` which was a missing assignment, then corrected.

8.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\UploadProgressBar\UploadProgressBar.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/7/2026, 10:04:25 AM` and `1/7/2026, 12:08:06 PM`.
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   Initial change at `1/7/2026, 10:04:25 AM` introduced filtering out "Completed" files from `uploadStatus` for display.
        *   A more significant update around `1/7/2026, 10:14:39 AM` involved passing `setUploadStatus` as a prop to allow the progress bar component to clear its state completely on close. This change was then reverted or commented out in subsequent entries (`1/7/2026, 10:19:53 AM` onwards), returning to the original behavior where `handleCancel` is called for each item. The intention to clear all status on close seems to have been deferred or changed.

9.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\ConfirmationModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `1/7/2026, 1:16:21 PM`.
    *   **Key Updates:** Added `maskClosable={false}` and `keyboard={false}` to the Ant Design `Modal` component. This prevents the modal from closing when clicking outside it or pressing the ESC key, making it a more rigid confirmation.

### Recurring Elements and Patterns:

*   **File Management Operations:** A strong recurring pattern across `NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`, `FileManagerGrid.jsx`, `FileManager.jsx` (both `all_notices` and `case_status`) is the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for files and folders:
    *   **Upload:** `handleFileChange`, `handleFolderChange`, `uploadFile`, `getSignedUrl` are common functions for managing file uploads, often involving S3 pre-signed URLs. Duplicate file handling (status "Replace") is also common.
    *   **Download:** `handleDownload`, `onDownloadAll`, and the use of `JSZip` and `file-saver` for folder downloads.
    *   **Delete:** `handleDelete`, `handleFolderDelete`, `handleFolderDeleteConfirmed` functions are used to remove single files or all files within a folder.
    *   **Rename/Update:** `handleUpdate` functions for renaming files, reconstructing file paths.
*   **Ant Design Components:** The usage of `message`, `Dropdown`, `Modal`, `Pagination`, `Spin`, `Button`, `Input` from Ant Design is prevalent for UI elements and feedback.
*   **State Management:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`) are heavily used for component-level state and lifecycle management. Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) is used for global state, particularly for file-related data.
*   **API Interaction:** `axios` is consistently used for making HTTP requests to `ROOT_URL/upload_documents/` with `Authorization` headers including `Bearer ${await getValidAccessToken()}` for authentication.
*   **Error Handling:** `message.error()` from Ant Design and `console.error()` are standard for displaying user-facing errors and logging. The `handleAxiosError` utility is used for more robust error handling and Sentry integration in `all_notices/FileManager.jsx`.
*   **Tracking:** `trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED, { buttonName: "..." })` is used to log user interactions, indicating a common analytics integration.
*   **Folder Structure & Traversal:** `buildTreeStructure`, `collectFolderFiles`, `collectFolderFileTitles`, and `calculateFolderSizeBytes` indicate a consistent approach to representing and interacting with hierarchical file/folder data.
*   **Timestamps:** All changes occurred on `1/6/2026` and `1/7/2026`, suggesting a concentrated period of development or bug fixing related to file management features. There are clusters of rapid changes within these two days, particularly around `FilePreviewModal.jsx` and `UploadProgressBar.jsx` (commenting out, re-implementing, and reverting password handling/state management).

## 2:33:12 PM
The provided log details changes across several JavaScript files within the `CaseTrack-frontend` project, specifically within the `casetrack-web` application, between January 6th and 7th, 2026.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/6/2026, 12:00:30 PM` and `1/7/2026, 11:55:52 AM`.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   Initial versions of the file show a robust file upload and management component with functionalities like fetching, downloading, deleting (single file and folder), and renaming files. It integrates with Redux for state management, Ant Design for UI components, and `axios` for API calls to a `ROOT_URL/upload_documents/` endpoint.
        *   A `buildTreeStructure` function is used to organize files into a hierarchical view.
        *   Error handling with `message.error` and `console.error` is consistently applied.
        *   Tracking of user interactions (`trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED, ...)` ) is present for various actions like upload, delete, and rename.
        *   Folder-specific operations (`handleFolderDelete`, `collectFolderFiles`) are implemented.
        *   On `1/7/2026, 10:38:43 AM`, a new state `folderLoading` was introduced, suggesting a need to manage loading states specifically for folder operations.
        *   On `1/7/2026, 11:55:19 AM` and `1/7/2026, 11:55:52 AM`, `setUploadStatus` was added to the destructuring of `useCreateFileUploadUtils`, indicating a refinement in how upload status is managed and potentially controlled from this component.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManagerGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/6/2026, 12:10:57 PM` and `1/7/2026, 10:27:11 AM`.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This file provides a file manager grid specifically for "NOTICE\_DOCUMENT" types, utilizing similar file management functionalities as `NewFileUploadGrid.jsx` (delete, rename, download, folder operations).
        *   It includes utilities for parsing and formatting file sizes (`parseSizeToBytes`, `formatBytes`, `calculateFolderSizeBytes`).
        *   It builds a tree structure for files from `filesData`.
        *   Error handling is centralized via `handleAxiosError`.
        *   Uses `JSZip` and `file-saver` for folder download functionality.
        *   On `1/6/2026, 4:34:00 PM`, a broken import `import Loader2 from "";` was added, which was immediately fixed to `import Loader from "../Loader";` at `1/6/2026, 4:34:38 PM`, then to `import Loader2 from "../Loader2";` at `1/6/2026, 4:36:03 PM`. This indicates refactoring or debugging related to loader components.
        *   On `1/7/2026, 10:22:00 AM`, a new state `folderLoading` was introduced to manage loading states for folder operations, mirroring the change in `NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`.
        *   On `1/7/2026, 1:32:08 PM`, the `handleDeleteSubmit` function was refactored to use an `AbortController` for cancellable delete operations, and a `deleteAbortController` state variable was introduced and managed within `closeModal`. This is a significant enhancement for handling long-running delete tasks and improving user experience. The previous commented-out version of `handleDeleteSubmit` was then restored with the new abort logic on `1/7/2026, 1:33:08 PM`.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\FilePreviewModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/6/2026, 12:34:45 PM` and `1/6/2026, 1:03:40 PM`.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This component handles file previews for images, PDFs, and Office documents. It uses `react-pdf` for PDF rendering and `view.officeapps.live.com` for Office documents.
        *   A key feature is its handling of password-protected PDFs. Initially, it directly used `window.prompt` and would close the modal if the password was not provided (or cancel was clicked).
        *   On `1/6/2026, 12:43:26 PM`, the logic for password-protected PDFs was refactored, attempting to use internal state (`passwordModalOpen`, `pdfPassword`, `passwordCallbackRef`) for a more controlled password input, but this change was then largely reverted back to the `window.prompt` approach by `1/6/2026, 12:45:04 PM`.
        *   Further refinements to the password prompt logic for PDFs occurred on `1/6/2026, 12:50:36 PM` and subsequent commits. The logic was adjusted to specifically handle `null` (cancel) and empty string inputs, ensuring the modal does not close if the user attempts to proceed with an empty password, prompting them again instead (`while (true)` loop added on `1/6/2026, 12:57:00 PM`).

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\TDSATDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes between `1/6/2026, 1:12:41 PM` and `1/6/2026, 1:15:44 PM`.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This component displays details for TDSAT cases, including case overview, status tables (case proceeding, order details, document details), and cause list data.
        *   It uses Apollo Client for GraphQL queries (`useQuery`, `useLazyQuery`).
        *   It integrates `FileManager` and `NotesManager`.
        *   A significant change occurred on `1/6/2026, 1:15:44 PM`, where the `<FileManager />` component was commented out (`{/* <FileManager /> */}`), implying a temporary disablement or removal of the file management feature from this specific court details view.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/6/2026, 1:14:18 PM` and `1/7/2026, 10:54:25 AM`.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This `FileManager` component is responsible for handling file uploads (single and folder), fetching file data, and initiating downloads for case documents. It relies on signed S3 URLs for direct uploads.
        *   It manages upload status with a `setUploadStatus` state, tracking progress and status (`Uploading`, `Replace`, `Failed`, `Completed`) for individual files.
        *   It incorporates `UploadProgressBar` to show upload progress.
        *   Error handling is integrated with Sentry (`Sentry.captureException`) and Ant Design messages.
        *   `AbortController` is used to allow cancellation of in-progress uploads (`handleCancel`).
        *   The `multiLevelPath` function is present to shorten deep folder paths for display.
        *   On `1/7/2026, 10:15:29 AM`, the `handleFileChange` and `handleDirectoryInputChange` functions were commented out and then re-introduced shortly after with potentially minor changes or testing.
        *   On `1/7/2026, 10:54:25 AM`, the logic for `handleFileChange` was uncommented again, suggesting a period of testing or debugging for the upload functionality.

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\SupremeCourtDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes at `1/6/2026, 1:15:56 PM` and `1/6/2026, 1:25:42 PM`.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   Similar to `TDSATDetails.jsx`, this component displays details for Supreme Court cases, including various status tables (Notices, Earlier Court, Caveats, etc.).
        *   It includes the `<FileManager />` component, indicating that file management is integrated into Supreme Court case details. No functional changes were observed in this file itself, only structural confirmation of `FileManager` usage.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes between `1/6/2026, 1:38:48 PM` and `1/7/2026, 11:23:02 AM`.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This `FileManager` component is similar to the `case_status` one but tailored for "NOTICE\_DOCUMENT" types.
        *   It also uses signed S3 URLs for uploads, manages upload status, and integrates `UploadProgressBar`.
        *   A specific `handleAxiosError` utility is defined here, which captures exceptions with Sentry and displays user-friendly messages.
        *   On `1/7/2026, 11:23:02 AM`, the `fileListRef.current = newFileList;` was moved inside the `if (newFileList.length > 0)` block within `handleFileChange`, suggesting a minor optimization or bug fix. Also, `setUploadStatus` was explicitly passed to `UploadProgressBar`.

8.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\UploadProgressBar\UploadProgressBar.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between `1/7/2026, 10:04:25 AM` and `1/7/2026, 12:08:06 PM`.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   The file initially shows a component that renders the progress of multiple file uploads.
        *   A significant change occurred on `1/7/2026, 10:04:25 AM`, where the `handleClose` logic was modified to only cancel *active* (non-completed) uploads and then filter the displayed data to only show active uploads. This was then reverted on `1/7/2026, 10:19:53 AM`, restoring the previous behavior where `handleClose` would clear all upload statuses.
        *   The `setUploadStatus` prop was added to the component's signature, indicating that the parent component now has direct control over clearing the entire upload status, instead of the progress bar component deciding what to clear. This change appears in `1/7/2026, 10:14:39 AM` and is maintained in later versions of the file.

9.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\ConfirmationModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Change at `1/7/2026, 1:16:21 PM`.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   The `ConfirmationModal` component was enhanced by adding `maskClosable={false}` and `keyboard={false}` to the Ant Design `Modal` component. This prevents the modal from being closed by clicking outside or pressing the ESC key, making it a "sticky" or "blocking" modal until an explicit action is taken.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **File Upload/Management Logic:** There is a strong pattern of implementing file upload, download, delete, and rename functionalities across `NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`, `FileManager.jsx` (for both `case_status` and `all_notices`), and `FileManagerGrid.jsx` (for both `case_status` and `all_notices`).
*   **API Interaction:** All file operations consistently interact with the backend via `axios` and a `ROOT_URL/upload_documents/` endpoint, requiring `Authorization` with a `Bearer ${await getValidAccessToken()}` token.
*   **State Management:** `useState`, `useRef`, and `useMemo` are heavily used for component-level state and memoization. `useSelector` and `useDispatch` from `react-redux` are used to interact with a global `files` store and `userData` store.
*   **User Feedback & Tracking:** Ant Design's `message` component is used extensively for user feedback (success, error, info). `trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED, ...)` is consistently used to track user interactions for analytics.
*   **File Structure & Display:** Both `NewFileUploadGrid.jsx` and `FileManagerGrid.jsx` involve building a tree-like structure for files and folders and calculating folder sizes, suggesting a consistent approach to displaying hierarchical file data.
*   **Error Handling:** A `handleAxiosError` utility (or similar manual `catch` blocks) is frequently used to catch and display API errors. Sentry integration is present in `all_notices/FileManager.jsx`.
*   **Loading States:** `loaderType` and `loading` states are common across components to manage UI feedback during asynchronous operations (fetch, delete, edit, upload). `folderLoading` was introduced specifically for folder operations.
*   **Reverted/Commented Code:** There are instances of code being commented out and later re-enabled or modified, especially in `FilePreviewModal.jsx` and `FileManager.jsx` (case status), suggesting periods of active development, experimentation, and refinement of specific features. The password prompt logic in `FilePreviewModal.jsx` went through a cycle of advanced state-based management to a more direct `window.prompt` approach, with subsequent refinements for edge cases.

### Significant Changes by Timestamp:

*   **`1/6/2026, 12:43:26 PM` (FilePreviewModal.jsx):** Attempted to implement a custom modal for PDF password entry, replacing `window.prompt`.
*   **`1/6/2026, 12:57:00 PM` (FilePreviewModal.jsx):** Refined the `onPassword` callback to persistently prompt the user for a non-empty password or allow cancellation to close the modal.
*   **`1/6/2026, 1:15:44 PM` (TDSATDetails.jsx):** The `<FileManager />` component was commented out, effectively disabling the file management UI for TDSAT cases.
*   **`1/6/2026, 4:34:00 PM` - `1/6/2026, 4:36:03 PM` (FileManagerGrid.jsx - all_notices):** Quick fixes for a broken `Loader2` import path.
*   **`1/7/2026, 10:04:25 AM` (UploadProgressBar.jsx):** Implemented filtering of `Completed` uploads from the progress bar display and adjusted `handleClose` to cancel only active uploads.
*   **`1/7/2026, 10:14:39 AM` (UploadProgressBar.jsx):** Changed `UploadProgressBar` to receive `setUploadStatus` as a prop, giving parent components explicit control over clearing upload states.
*   **`1/7/2026, 10:19:53 AM` (UploadProgressBar.jsx):** Reverted the filtering logic for completed uploads and the "cancel active uploads" behavior in `handleClose`, returning to simply clearing all status states.
*   **`1/7/2026, 10:22:00 AM` (FileManagerGrid.jsx - all_notices):** Added `folderLoading` state to manage loading UI for folder-specific operations.
*   **`1/7/2026, 1:16:21 PM` (ConfirmationModal.jsx):** Enhanced the `ConfirmationModal` by disabling `maskClosable` and `keyboard` to make it a blocking modal.
*   **`1/7/2026, 1:32:08 PM` (FileManagerGrid.jsx - case_status):** Implemented `AbortController` for cancellable delete operations, and introduced `deleteAbortController` state to manage this.

## 3:33:09 PM
The changes across the provided files primarily revolve around enhancing file management, upload, and deletion functionalities, with a specific focus on user experience and robustness, particularly concerning PDF file previews and folder operations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\FilePreviewModal.jsx` (1/6/2026, 12:51:58 PM - 1:03:40 PM):**
    *   This file, responsible for displaying file previews, underwent several iterative changes related to handling password-protected PDF files.
    *   Initially, an unimplemented `onPassword` callback for `react-pdf` was present as a commented-out block.
    *   The first active implementation (12:51:58 PM) allowed a password prompt but would close the modal if the user didn't enter a password.
    *   A subsequent change (12:52:28 PM) modified this behavior, preventing the modal from closing immediately if no password was provided, simply returning from the callback.
    *   Later changes (12:54:30 PM, 12:54:54 PM) reverted to closing the modal if no password was entered, setting `fileUrl` to null.
    *   The final major modification to this logic (12:57:00 PM, sustained through 1:03:40 PM) introduced a `while (true)` loop within the `onPassword` callback. This loop repeatedly prompts the user for a password until a non-empty one is entered or the user explicitly cancels, in which case the modal closes and `fileUrl` is reset. This significantly improves the user experience for password-protected PDFs.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\TDSATDetails.jsx` (1/6/2026, 1:12:41 PM - 1:15:44 PM):**
    *   This component, which displays TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal) case details, had a section related to file management commented out.
    *   At 1:12:41 PM, both `<FileManager />` and `<NotesManager />` within the `content-manager-root-container` were commented out.
    *   By 1:13:12 PM, the `FileManager` component was re-enabled (uncommented).
    *   However, by 1:15:44 PM, the `FileManager` component was commented out again, leaving only `NotesManager` within the `content-manager-root-container`. This indicates an intentional decision to temporarily or permanently remove the `FileManager` from this specific view.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx` (1/6/2026, 1:14:18 PM - 1:38:18 PM & 1/7/2026, 10:15:29 AM - 10:54:25 AM):**
    *   This file handles file and folder uploads, downloads, and tracking for case documents.
    *   The `handleFileChange` and `handleDirectoryInputChange` functions were initially active.
    *   Between 1/7/2026, 10:15:29 AM and 10:54:25 AM, there was a temporary period where large blocks of code within `handleFileChange` and `handleDirectoryInputChange` were commented out and then re-enabled. This suggests experimentation or debugging related to the upload process. The underlying logic remained the same across these comment/uncomment cycles.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\SupremeCourtDetails.jsx` (1/6/2026, 1:15:56 PM - 1:25:42 PM):**
    *   No significant changes were observed; the code remained identical in both entries for this file. It consistently includes `FileManager` and `NotesManager`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManager.jsx` (1/6/2026, 1:38:48 PM - 1/7/2026, 11:23:02 AM):**
    *   This file, similar to `FileManager.jsx` for case status, manages files for notices. It explicitly includes Sentry for error tracking.
    *   The `handleAxiosError` function is defined within this component, providing structured error logging and user feedback.
    *   Similar to the case status `FileManager`, there was a temporary change (1/7/2026, 5:18:20 PM) where `fileListRef.current = newFileList;` was duplicated inside `handleFileChange`'s `if (newFileList.length > 0)` block, which was subsequently removed in the following entry (1/7/2026, 11:23:02 AM).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManagerGrid.jsx` (1/6/2026, 4:31:15 PM - 1/7/2026, 3:30:01 PM):**
    *   This component displays and manages files in a grid layout, including folder support, for notices.
    *   It contains functions for parsing and formatting file sizes (`parseSizeToBytes`, `formatBytes`).
    *   It recursively calculates folder sizes (`calculateFolderSizeBytes`).
    *   Significant activity involved adding and removing a `Loader2` import, eventually settling on `Loader2` from `../Loader2` (1/6/2026, 4:34:38 PM to 4:39:59 PM).
    *   A `folderLoading` state was introduced (1/7/2026, 10:22:00 AM) to manage loading states specifically for folder operations (download/delete).
    *   The `closeModal` function was updated (1/7/2026, 3:20:59 PM to 3:30:01 PM) to include a check for ongoing `loading` states and display an informational message to the user if an action is in progress, preventing premature modal closure.
    *   It also contains commented-out blocks (1/6/2026, 5:59:40 PM - 1/7/2026, 9:54:05 AM) that essentially comment out the entire file content, indicating a significant temporary disablement or refactoring effort.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\UploadProgressBar\UploadProgressBar.jsx` (1/7/2026, 10:04:25 AM - 12:08:06 PM):**
    *   This component displays the progress of file uploads.
    *   An important change was introduced (10:04:25 AM) to filter out "Completed" files from the `activeUploads` list, so only pending or failed uploads are shown in the progress bar.
    *   The `handleClose` function was modified (10:14:39 AM) to explicitly clear *all* upload statuses (`setUploadStatus({})`) and to call `handleCancel` only for non-completed uploads, indicating a cleanup strategy.
    *   Further changes (1/7/2026, 10:19:53 AM) commented out the "new" logic of clearing all statuses and filtering active uploads, reverting to the older behavior of iterating through all upload statuses and canceling each, then clearing them. This pattern repeated: the filtering and full state reset logic was commented out, then re-enabled (1/7/2026, 10:52:13 AM and onward) suggesting iterative testing or a back-and-forth decision on the ideal cleanup method.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\NewFileUploadGrid.jsx` (1/7/2026, 10:37:58 AM - 11:55:52 AM):**
    *   This is a general-purpose file upload grid component.
    *   It introduced `folderLoading` state to manage loading indicators for folder operations.
    *   The `useCreateFileUploadUtils` hook now provides `setUploadStatus`, indicating a more direct control over the upload status state from this component.
    *   The `closeModal` function was updated (1/7/2026, 3:31:22 PM) to prevent closing if a `loaderType` is active, showing an informational message instead.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\ConfirmationModal.jsx` (1/7/2026, 1:16:21 PM - 3:19:38 PM):**
    *   This modal component for confirmations saw a brief addition of `maskClosable={false}` and `keyboard={false}` properties (1:16:21 PM to 2:50:43 PM) to prevent users from closing the modal by clicking outside or pressing the ESC key. These changes were subsequently reverted (2:50:53 PM to 3:19:38 PM), indicating a decision to allow these closing behaviors.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **File Management Focus:** A consistent theme is the development and refinement of file management features (upload, download, delete, rename, preview) across different components (`FilePreviewModal`, `FileManager`, `FileManagerGrid`, `NewFileUploadGrid`).
2.  **Modular Components:** The use of distinct components like `FilePreviewModal`, `FileManager`, `FileManagerGrid`, `UploadProgressBar`, and `ConfirmationModal` points to a modular architecture.
3.  **Ant Design Library:** The `antd` library is heavily used for UI components (Modal, message, Pagination, Dropdown, Spin, Button), indicating a standardized UI framework.
4.  **Asynchronous Operations with Axios:** All network requests for file operations (upload, download, delete, get signed URL) are handled using `axios`, often with `async/await` and error handling (`.then().catch().finally()`).
5.  **State Management:** `useState` and `useRef` hooks are extensively used for local component state, along with `useSelector` and `useDispatch` for Redux-based global state management (`@case-track-mono/Store`).
6.  **Error Handling:** The `handleAxiosError` function (or similar logic) is a recurring pattern for centralized error feedback via `antd.message.error` and console logging, often integrated with Sentry (`@sentry/react` in `all_notices/FileManager.jsx`).
7.  **User Interaction Tracking:** `trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED, { buttonName: "..." })` is consistently used to log user actions, demonstrating an emphasis on analytics.
8.  **Folder Handling Logic:** Several components (`FileManagerGrid`, `NewFileUploadGrid`) include complex logic to manage files within a hierarchical folder structure, including recursive size calculation, deletion of all files in a folder, and folder downloads using `JSZip`.
9.  **Loading States:** Extensive use of `setLoading`, `setLoaderType`, `folderLoading` states, and `Loader`/`Loader2` components indicates a strong focus on providing visual feedback during asynchronous operations.
10. **PDF Password Handling:** The `FilePreviewModal.jsx` repeatedly refined its `onPassword` callback logic for `react-pdf`, demonstrating an iterative approach to improving specific, complex user interactions.
11. **Temporary Commenting/Uncommenting:** There are several instances where large blocks of code, or even entire files, were commented out and then re-enabled within a short timeframe. This suggests periods of active development, debugging, or temporary feature disablement during development.
12. **Monorepo Structure:** Imports like `@case-track-mono/Configs` and `@case-track-mono/Utils` indicate a monorepo setup, promoting code sharing and consistency across different applications within the "CaseTrack-frontend" project.

## 8:44:05 PM
The provided log details changes across several JavaScript/JSX files within the `CaseTrack-frontend` project, specifically related to file management and display components. The changes span from January 6, 2026, to January 7, 2026.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\FilePreviewModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/6/2026, 12:51:58 PM to 1/6/2026, 1:03:40 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:** This file primarily handles the preview of various file types (PDF, image, office documents) within a modal. The most significant changes occurred in the `onPassword` callback function for PDF documents.
        *   Initially (12:51:58 PM), if a password was not entered, the modal would close and `fileUrl` would be set to `null`.
        *   A subsequent change (12:52:28 PM) modified this logic: if `pwd` is empty, it `return;`s without closing the modal, still allowing the user to input a password.
        *   Later (12:54:30 PM, 12:54:54 PM), the logic reverted to the original behavior of closing the modal and setting `fileUrl` to `null` if no password was entered.
        *   Finally (1/6/2026, 12:57:00 PM and 1:03:40 PM), the logic was updated to implement a `while(true)` loop within the `onPassword` callback. This loop continuously prompts the user for a password until a non-empty password is provided or the user explicitly cancels, in which case the modal closes.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\TDSATDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/6/2026, 1:12:41 PM to 1/6/2026, 1:15:44 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:** This component handles the display of TDSAT case details.
        *   At 1:12:41 PM, the `FileManager` and `NotesManager` components within the `content-manager-root-container` div were commented out.
        *   By 1:13:12 PM, the `FileManager` and `NotesManager` components were uncommented, restoring their visibility.
        *   At 1:15:44 PM, the `FileManager` component was once again commented out within the `content-manager-root-container`, leaving only `NotesManager` visible if `managementCaseId` exists.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/6/2026, 1:14:18 PM to 1/7/2026, 10:54:25 AM.
    *   **Key Changes:** This file manages file uploads, downloads, and deletion for case documents.
        *   Multiple identical changes between 1:14:18 PM and 1:38:18 PM, likely minor re-saves or formatting changes, as the code content remains largely the same.
        *   On 1/7/2026, 10:15:29 AM and 10:52:45 AM, the `handleFileChange` and `handleDirectoryInputChange` functions saw significant commenting out of old logic and then uncommenting of a slightly modified version. The core logic for handling file uploads (getting signed URLs, uploading to S3, updating the backend) remained, but the comment patterns suggest a review or refactor around duplicate file handling and setting `uploadStatus`.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\courts\SupremeCourtDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/6/2026, 1:15:56 PM to 1/6/2026, 1:25:42 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:** No discernible code changes between these timestamps; the content remains identical.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManager.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/6/2026, 1:38:48 PM to 1/7/2026, 11:23:02 AM.
    *   **Key Changes:** This `FileManager` component is specifically for notice documents.
        *   At 1:38:48 PM, `Sentry` was imported for error tracking, and a `handleAxiosError` utility function was added to centralize error handling, including Sentry capture and Ant Design messages.
        *   On 1/7/2026, 5:18:20 PM and 11:23:02 AM, the `handleFileChange` function's logic was adjusted for setting `fileListRef.current` and displaying the `UploadProgressBar` modal. Previously, `fileListRef.current` was set before `initialProgress` was computed and `isUploadModalVisible` was set. The new change (specifically 5:18:20 PM) involves re-assigning `fileListRef.current = newFileList;` right before `setIsUploadModalVisible(true);` after `setUploadStatus(initialProgress);` which is a minor rearrangement, likely to ensure correct state updates before modal visibility.

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\all_notices\FileManagerGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/6/2026, 4:31:15 PM to 1/7/2026, 3:30:01 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:** This component displays files and folders in a grid, including features like preview, rename, delete, and download.
        *   Around 4:34:00 PM on 1/6/2026, there was an attempt to import `Loader2` from an empty path, which was corrected to `../Loader` (then `../Loader2`) by 4:34:38 PM.
        *   A `[folderLoading, setFolderLoading]` state was introduced around 1/7/2026, 10:22:00 AM, likely to manage loading states specifically for folder operations (like downloading entire folders).
        *   Several changes involved commenting out large blocks of code and then uncommenting them with minor adjustments, particularly in the `handleDeleteSubmit` and `closeModal` functions.
        *   The `closeModal` function was modified on 1/7/2026, 3:08:23 PM, and subsequently on 3:29:13 PM and 3:30:01 PM, to prevent closing the modal if a `loading` operation is in progress, displaying an `info` message instead.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\UploadProgressBar\UploadProgressBar.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/7/2026, 10:04:25 AM to 1/7/2026, 12:08:06 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:** This component displays the progress of file uploads.
        *   Initially (10:04:25 AM), the component was uncommented after being fully commented out, with a new feature to filter out `COMPLETED` files from the active uploads list. The `handleClose` function was updated to cancel active uploads and clear `uploadStatus`.
        *   A subsequent change (10:14:39 AM) removed the filtering of `COMPLETED` files from the `data` variable and ensured `handleClose` clears *all* `uploadStatus`, effectively displaying all uploads (including completed ones) until manually dismissed.
        *   Around 10:19:53 AM, the code reverted to the state prior to the filtering changes, displaying all upload statuses.
        *   From 10:52:13 AM to 12:08:06 PM, the `UploadProgressBar` component consistently uses `setUploadStatus({})` in its `handleClose` function to clear all upload statuses when the modal is closed, without explicitly cancelling individual ongoing uploads, and does not filter out "Completed" items for display in the `data` array. This also involves uncommenting and re-commenting large identical blocks of code, suggesting testing or structural changes around this time.

8.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\ConfirmationModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/7/2026, 1:16:21 PM to 1/7/2026, 3:19:38 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:** This component provides a generic confirmation modal.
        *   At 1:16:21 PM, `maskClosable={false}` and `keyboard={false}` were added to the Ant Design `Modal` component, preventing the modal from being closed by clicking outside or pressing the ESC key.
        *   These additions were then commented out in later changes (2:50:53 PM), reverting to the default behavior where the modal could be dismissed by clicking outside or pressing ESC. All other changes within this file are identical copies.

9.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 1/7/2026, 10:37:58 AM to 1/7/2026, 11:55:52 AM.
    *   **Key Changes:** This component is a generic file upload grid used for various document types (expense, payment, timesheet, task).
        *   A `folderLoading` state was added around 10:38:43 AM.
        *   The `useCreateFileUploadUtils` hook was updated to expose `setUploadStatus` around 11:55:19 AM.
        *   The `closeModal` function was modified at 3:31:22 PM to prevent closing if `loaderType` is active, showing an info message instead. This change is consistent with the `FileManagerGrid` component's `closeModal` logic.
        *   Multiple small, repetitive saves with identical code are observed, similar to other files.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Date:** All changes occur on January 6th and 7th, 2026, indicating a focused period of development or refactoring.
*   **File Management Logic:** A core theme is the management of file operations (upload, download, delete, rename, preview) across multiple components (`FilePreviewModal`, `FileManager`, `FileManagerGrid`, `NewFileUploadGrid`).
*   **Modals:** `ConfirmationModal`, `FilePreviewModal`, and `UpdateFileNameModal` are frequently used and modified, suggesting a strong reliance on modal dialogs for user interaction.
*   **State Management:** `useState` and `useRef` hooks are heavily used for managing local component state, including loading indicators (`loading`, `loaderType`, `folderLoading`), modal visibility (`modalData`, `isUploadModalVisible`), and file data (`filesData`, `uploadStatus`, `fileListRef`).
*   **API Interaction:** `axios` is consistently used for making POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT requests to a `ROOT_URL/upload_documents/` endpoint, usually with an `Authorization` header containing a bearer token obtained via `getValidAccessToken()`. The requests often include `operation`, `document_for`, and an ID parameter (e.g., `management_case_id`, `notice_id`, `client_expense_id`) to specify the context of the document.
*   **Error Handling:** A recurring pattern is the use of `message.error()` from Ant Design and `console.error()` for handling API errors. The `FileManager.jsx` in `all_notices` specifically introduces `Sentry.captureException` and a dedicated `handleAxiosError` function for more robust error logging.
*   **Folder Operations:** New logic has been introduced or refined for handling folders, including calculating their size recursively (`calculateFolderSizeBytes`), collecting file titles within a folder (`collectFolderFileTitles`), and deleting or downloading entire folders. This suggests an enhancement to support hierarchical file structures.
*   **Upload Progress:** The `UploadProgressBar` component and related `uploadStatus` state are central to providing user feedback during file uploads, indicating progress, status (uploading, failed, completed, replace), and handling cancellations/re-uploads.
*   **User Experience (UX) Enhancements:**
    *   PDF password prompt logic was refined to prevent accidental modal closure.
    *   Confirmation modals were briefly made unclosable by mask/keyboard, then reverted.
    *   Deletion modals were updated to prevent closing while an action is in progress.
*   **Code Commenting/Uncommenting:** Several instances of large code blocks being commented out and then later re-introduced (sometimes with minor tweaks) indicate an iterative development process, possibly for testing alternative implementations or reverting temporary changes.
*   **Redux Integration:** The `NewFileUploadGrid.jsx` component integrates with Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) to manage file data globally across different document types (EXPENSE, PAYMENT\_RECEIVED, TIMESHEET\_LOG, TASK).
*   **Web Tracking:** `trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED, { buttonName: "..." });` is consistently used to log user interactions.

## 11:14:18 PM
The code changes primarily indicate a rebranding or shift in focus for a cryptocurrency-related web application, moving from "LIFE Protocol" to "Floki (pump fun)". This is reflected consistently across multiple components. The development process appears iterative, with frequent updates to visual assets, text, and component structure, often accompanied by temporary commenting and uncommenting of code sections.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\VIVEK\Vivek4\src\pages\Index.tsx`**:
    *   **1/7/2026, 9:19:35 PM**: Initial setup with background videos, a music player (using "Kalank Title Track"), and a music consent modal ("Welcome to LIFE Protocol"). Includes various sections like `Navbar`, `HeroSection`, `Gallery`, `WhyLifeMatters`, `WhitePaper`, `HowToBuy`, `Roadmap`, `LiveChart`, `Announcement`, `Footer`.
    *   **1/7/2026, 9:19:54 PM**: The mobile background video source (`bgMobile`) was changed from `HIGH_MOBILE_VIDEO.mp4` to use the same `bgVideo.mp4` as the desktop version.
    *   **1/7/2026, 9:23:06 PM**: The welcome message in the music modal was updated from "Welcome to LIFE Protocol" to "Welcome to Floki (pump fun)".
    *   **1/7/2026, 9:29:52 PM**: `WhyLifeMatters` and `WhitePaper` components were commented out, effectively hiding them from the main page.
    *   **1/7/2026, 10:15:33 PM & 10:22:24 PM**: The audio asset import was briefly broken (empty path) and then corrected to `song.mp3`, replacing the previous "Kalank Title Track".

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\VIVEK\Vivek4\src\components\WhitePaper.tsx`**:
    *   **1/7/2026, 9:24:14 PM**: The text within the White Paper section was updated to reflect the new project name, changing "The LIFE Protocol White Paper" to "The Floki (pump fun) White Paper".

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\VIVEK\Vivek4\src\components\Navbar.tsx`**:
    *   **1/7/2026, 9:30:40 PM**: Navigation links for "WHY LIFE MATTER" and "WHITE PAPER" were commented out. A new "WARZONE" link was added. The logo alt text and "BUY ON" button text were updated to "Floki (pump fun)".
    *   **1/7/2026, 11:09:58 PM**: The logo image asset was changed from a `.png` to a `.jpg` (`hero-right.jpg`).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\VIVEK\Vivek4\src\components\LiveChart.tsx`**:
    *   **1/7/2026, 9:32:26 PM**: The section title was changed from "LIVE CHART" to "Warzone".
    *   **1/7/2026, 9:32:59 PM**: The text "TO win BY more" was reordered, moving it below the chart iframe.
    *   **1/7/2026, 9:41:51 PM - 9:43:13 PM**: The "Let the war begin!" and "To win by more" phrases were wrapped in `motion.div` components, gaining animated entry and styling adjustments, including font size changes for the former.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\VIVEK\Vivek4\src\components\Gallery.tsx`**:
    *   **1/7/2026, 10:59:00 PM**: All six individual gallery image imports (`gallery1.jpg` through `gallery6.jpg`) were changed to use the same `gallery1.jpg` asset, standardizing the displayed image across the gallery. The gallery title remained "Floki GALLERY".

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\VIVEK\Vivek4\src\components\HeroSection.tsx`**:
    *   **1/7/2026, 10:23:22 PM**: Introduced initial hero section with social links, a placeholder "COMING SOON" contract address with copy functionality, and Framer Motion animations. A commented-out badge image was present.
    *   **1/7/2026, 10:26:42 PM**: The commented-out badge image section was removed.
    *   **1/7/2026, 10:27:09 PM - 10:28:32 PM**: The main heading's responsive font sizing classes (`motion.h1`) were repeatedly adjusted, indicating fine-tuning of text display on different screen sizes.
    *   **1/7/2026, 10:31:05 PM - 10:33:04 PM**: Multiple "Rock" image assets (`X.png`, `Telegram.png`, `bom.png`, `DEX.png`, `CA.png`) were imported. A "Full-width Rocks Row" element was added to the JSX, displaying these images with interactive and continuous animations (especially for the "BOM" rock).
    *   **1/7/2026, 10:41:54 PM**: The `Rock5` asset was changed to `CA.png`. A `Sword` image asset was introduced with an initial empty import path.
    *   **1/7/2026, 10:46:10 PM**: The `Sword` image import path was corrected to `sword.png`. A `motion.div` for the `Sword` image with animation was added within the contract address section. The contract address copy functionality (imports for `Copy`, `Check`, `useState`, `useToast` and the `handleCopy` function) was initially removed, then restored in subsequent changes.
    *   **1/7/2026, 10:57:27 PM - 10:57:57 PM**: The top margin (`mt-`) of the `div` containing the `Sword` image was adjusted multiple times (removed, `mt-2`, `mt-20`, `mt-28`), suggesting iterative positioning adjustments.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\VIVEK\Vivek4\src\components\Footer.tsx`**:
    *   **1/7/2026, 11:09:50 PM**: A footer component was defined, including a logo (`hero-right.jpg`), social media links (Twitter/X, Telegram, TikTok, Instagram), and a copyright notice ("© Floki (pump fun) The P. All rights reserved.").

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Rebranding to "Floki (pump fun)"**: A pervasive change observed across `Index.tsx`, `WhitePaper.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`, `HeroSection.tsx`, and `Footer.tsx`. This indicates a consistent effort to rename or re-theme the project.
2.  **Framer Motion Animations**: All observed component files (`Index.tsx`, `WhitePaper.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`, `LiveChart.tsx`, `Gallery.tsx`, `HeroSection.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`) heavily utilize `framer-motion` for various UI animations (fade-ins, slides, scales, hovers, continuous movements), suggesting a focus on dynamic and engaging user experience.
3.  **Asset Management and Thematic Elements**: There's a clear emphasis on updating visual and audio assets, particularly background videos, music, and new "rock" and "sword" images. This suggests a transition towards a more specific, potentially "game-like" or "meme-coin" aesthetic, as hinted by the "Warzone" section and themed image names.
4.  **Iterative Development/Debugging**: The repeated commenting and uncommenting of large code blocks (especially in `HeroSection.tsx` around 10:34 PM to 10:55 PM) and rapid-fire minor styling adjustments (e.g., font sizes, margins) strongly suggest an active development phase with frequent testing, refinement, or collaborative editing.
5.  **Component-Based Structure**: The project consistently uses a component-based architecture (`Navbar`, `HeroSection`, `Gallery`, etc.), which is standard in modern React applications.
6.  **Responsive Design**: Multiple components show responsive styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS breakpoints (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`), indicating an intention for the application to function well across various device sizes.
