# Activity Summary for 1/9/2026

## 1:52:50 PM
The code changes primarily focus on styling and data management for "About" sections, specifically "Our Approach" and "Media Mentions," within a MikeLegal-Web project. All modifications occurred on January 9, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\About\approach.module.css`**:
    *   **9:57:59 AM - 9:59:39 AM:** Initial setup and then a temporary commenting out of specific font-related styles (`margin-bottom`, `font-size`, `font-weight`) for `.approach_section_inner .title`, suggesting a shift to handle these styles elsewhere.
    *   **10:01:40 AM:** The `.approach_section_inner .title` CSS rule was entirely removed from this module.
    *   **10:02:37 AM - 10:08:07 AM:** Consistent adjustments to visual properties:
        *   `.principle_icon` `width` and `height` increased from `80px` to `110px`, then to `120px` (desktop), and `60px` to `80px` (mobile).
        *   `.principle_item p` `font-size` was changed from `1.1rem` to `20px`, then `24px`, and finally `26px`. `font-weight` and `color` properties for this element were commented out.
    *   **10:55:20 AM - 10:55:43 AM:** Refinements for responsive design, specifically setting a `font-size: 20px;` for `.principle_item p` within `max-width: 700px` media query.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\About\OurApproach.tsx`**:
    *   **10:00:18 AM - 10:01:23 AM:** The main heading for "Our Approach" (`h1`) had its bottom margin adjusted using utility classes, incrementally increasing from `mb-16` to `mb-24`, then to `mb-32`.
    *   **10:03:04 AM - 10:05:03 AM:** Font sizes for principle descriptions (`p` tags within `.principle_item`) were introduced and then adjusted using utility classes, specifically `fs-20` initially, then `fs-28` for the first two principle items.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\about.ts`**:
    *   **11:08:31 AM:** A large set of image imports for team members and media mentions (`.webp` files) were present.
    *   **11:15:33 AM:** A new image asset `anuj.webp` was imported.
    *   **11:18:37 AM:** A new image asset `abhijit.webp` was imported.
    *   **11:24:18 AM - 11:24:54 AM:** Corrections were made regarding the `abhijit` import. The import alias was changed from `abhijit` to `abhijeet`, and the corresponding team data entry's image reference was updated to use the correct `abhijeet` image asset instead of `angsuman`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\About\media.module.css`**:
    *   **11:37:25 AM - 11:39:49 AM:** Extensive fine-tuning of the layout for the media section:
        *   `.media_section` padding adjusted several times (e.g., `2.8rem 0`, `2rem 0`, `3rem 0`).
        *   `.media_section_inner` `max-width` was changed multiple times (`1300px` to `1330px`, `1360px`, then back to `1300px`, and `1330px`). Its padding was also adjusted (`0 2rem` to `0 2.5rem`, then `0 2.8rem`).
    *   **12:03:00 PM:** New CSS rules were introduced for custom slider arrow styling (`.custom_arrow`, `.arrow_icon`) to provide visual effects on hover (background, box-shadow, transform) and to hide the default `react-slick` arrow icons.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\About\MediaTestimonial.tsx`**:
    *   **11:41:12 AM - 11:42:11 AM:** Repeated adjustments were made to the `right` positioning of the `SampleNextArrow` component within the `react-slick` slider, moving between `-px`, `-50px`, `-45px`, and `-40px`.
    *   **11:43:08 AM:** The `SamplePrevArrow`'s `left` position was changed from `-44px` to `-50px`. Crucially, both `SamplePrevArrow` and `SampleNextArrow` had inline styles added to center them vertically (`display: 'flex'`, `alignItems: 'center'`, `justifyContent: 'center'`, `top: '50%'`, `transform: 'translateY(-50%)'`).
    *   **11:50:08 AM:** These inline flexbox and positioning styles, along with the arrow positions, were reverted back to their previous state (`left: '-44px'`, `right: '-44px'`).
    *   **12:03:50 PM - 12:05:38 PM:** The flexbox and vertical centering inline styles were re-introduced for both `SamplePrevArrow` and `SampleNextArrow`, and the `content` property for arrow images was explicitly included in the inline styles. This confirms the implementation of custom styled arrows for the slider.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Styling:** Many changes, especially in CSS files, involve small, incremental adjustments to padding, margins, font sizes, and max-widths, indicating a process of fine-tuning the UI layout and responsiveness.
*   **Slider Arrow Configuration:** There's a notable pattern of repeated modifications to the positioning and styling of the `react-slick` slider's navigation arrows in `MediaTestimonial.tsx` and related CSS, suggesting challenges in achieving the desired visual and functional behavior. This involves toggling between using `content` property for images and explicit `flex` styling for positioning.
*   **Data Maintenance:** The `about.ts` file primarily serves as a constant data store for images and team member information, with changes focusing on adding new entries or correcting existing image paths.
*   **Commenting Out/Removal:** The practice of commenting out CSS rules or removing them entirely, as seen with `.approach_section_inner .title`, suggests an evolution in how certain elements are styled, potentially moving towards utility classes or inline styles directly in components.
*   **Frequent Saves:** Numerous timestamps show identical code content, particularly in the `components\_constants\about.ts` and `components\About\MediaTestimonial.tsx` files, indicating frequent saves during development without substantive changes.
