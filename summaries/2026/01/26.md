# Activity Summary for 1/26/2026

## 1:40:58 PM
The `tsconfig.json` file was initialized or updated on 1/25/2026 at 4:42:53 PM, configuring standard TypeScript compiler options suitable for a React project, including ES5 target, ESNext modules, JSX preservation, and strict type checking.

The `package.json` was updated twice, at 7:19:52 PM and 7:22:32 PM on 1/25/2026, with identical content in both logs. It defines a React application named "iris-web" (version 0.1.0). Key dependencies include React (v17), Redux Toolkit, React Router DOM (v6), Ant Design (v4), Axios, Lodash, Moment, React Icons, React Toastify, and Styled Components. Development dependencies indicate the use of TypeScript, ESLint (v8.2.0), and Prettier for code quality and formatting.

The `package-lock.json` file, also updated at 7:19:58 PM on 1/25/2026, reflects the locked versions of the dependencies listed in `package.json`. It details a wide array of transitive dependencies, including various `@babel/*` packages and `@ant-design/*` utilities. A notable discrepancy in the truncated log is the presence of `eslint-config-airbnb`, `eslint-config-node`, and `eslint-plugin-node` in the devDependencies within the `package-lock.json`'s root package entry, which are not present in the corresponding `package.json` logs.

The `src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx` component saw multiple log entries between 7:40:18 PM and 8:00:46 PM on 1/25/2026. This is a significant React component built for managing "Hearings" data.
*   It utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useNavigate`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and a rich set of Ant Design components (Tabs, Table, List, Popconfirm, Button, Select, Typography).
*   The component supports two main types of hearings: "TLA" and "Opposition", and distinguishes between "unverified" and "verified" states, affecting data fetching and UI actions.
*   It dispatches Redux actions to fetch hearing data based on the current URL path.
*   Table columns display "Cause List Title" (with dynamic links), "Total count (Journal | Actual)", "Profile counts (Portfolio | 3rd Party)", "Reports", and "Files" (with links to PDF, Excel, and Processed Excel).
*   Actions vary by tab: "unverified" hearings allow "Add Rows" (conditional for "Opposition"), "Upload", and "Verify" (with a `Popconfirm` for data validation warnings), while "verified" hearings allow "Send Report."
*   Styling is managed using `styled-components` (e.g., `FileStyle`, `StyledSteps`, `MyTable`).
*   Subsequent logs for `Hearing.tsx` are largely identical, with a minor refactoring at 7:41:59 PM to explicitly deconstruct `Title` from `Typography`. No further functional changes were observed in this file in the provided logs.

Overall, the changes indicate an active development phase on 1/25/2026, focused on setting up a React application with TypeScript, Redux, Ant Design, and establishing a core UI component for managing "Hearing" entries with conditional display and actions. A minor inconsistency was noted in the ESLint devDependencies between `package.json` and `package-lock.json` entries.
