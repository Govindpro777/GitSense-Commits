# Activity Summary for 1/18/2026

## 1:42:58 PM
**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
This file, central to contract file management, underwent significant and iterative changes.
*   **Initial Setup (1/16/2026, 3:08:21 PM)**: The component was established with basic file display, search, sort, selection, download, and delete functionalities. It utilized Ant Design components and mock `FilesListItem` data, managing UI states locally.
*   **API Integration Preparation (1/16/2026, 6:00:06 PM - 6:00:25 PM)**: Minor changes were introduced to retrieve `access_token` from `localStorage` and log it, hinting at upcoming backend integration.
*   **Major Refactor for Dynamic Data Fetch (1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM)**: The component was heavily refactored. The hardcoded file list was replaced with dynamic data fetching using `axios` and `useEffect`. It began extracting a `document_id` from URL search parameters (`useSearchParams`) to fetch specific contract documents from `${ROOT_URL}/contract-documents`, including an authorization header with the `access_token`. The `FilesListItem` interface was slightly modified.
*   **Apparent Rollback and Re-refactor (1/17/2026, 11:47:21 AM - 3:03:06 PM)**: The code briefly reverted to using hardcoded file data, removing the `axios` and `useSearchParams` imports. However, this was quickly undone, and subsequent changes re-introduced and stabilized the API-driven fetching logic. During this period, `useRef`, `useOnlineStatus`, and `useDispatch` (for Redux integration) were added, and the import path for `useOnlineStatus` was corrected iteratively. Integration with Redux for error handling (`setError` from `@mike-clm/shared`) was also implemented.
*   **Further Shared Utility Integration (1/17/2026, 3:24:24 PM - 4:13:59 PM)**: Additional imports from the `@mike-clm/shared` library were added, including `useUserData` and `convertDate`. A new type `LoaderType` was introduced, suggesting a more robust loading state management system.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\Calendar\Calendar.tsx`**
*   **Initial Structure and Filter Logic (1/16/2026, 5:08:58 PM)**: The `Calendar` container was set up to manage event filters (contract start, end, renewal, execution, obligation) and team filters using Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and local state (`useState`). It featured "Apply" and "Reset" filter buttons. Notably, the main `CalendarModule` component was initially commented out within the JSX.
*   **Calendar Module Activation (1/16/2026, 5:09:13 PM)**: Shortly after, the `CalendarModule` component was uncommented, integrating it into the UI and passing down the managed filter states, enabling the visual calendar functionality.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx`**
*   **Temporary Comment Out (1/17/2026, 11:44:29 AM)**: The entire `FileManagerGrid` component, responsible for displaying files in a tree-like folder structure with selection and action capabilities, was commented out.
*   **Restoration and Active Development (1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM)**: The component was fully uncommented and restored. It features a tree logic to organize files and folders based on their `title` path, checkbox-based selection for individual files and folders (with indeterminate states), and actions like download and delete, including a `DeleteModal` for confirmation.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\utils\functions\useOnlineStatus.ts`**
*   **New Utility Hook (1/17/2026, 1:54:26 PM)**: A new custom React hook, `useOnlineStatus`, was created. This hook provides a state variable (`isOnline`) that reflects the browser's current online/offline status, utilizing `window.addEventListener` for real-time updates and includes a guard for server-side rendering environments.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Ant Design (antd) UI Library**: A prominent recurring element is the extensive use of Ant Design components (Input, Button, Select, Pagination, Checkbox, Dropdown, Divider, Badge, message) across `Files.tsx` and `Calendar.tsx`, indicating a consistent UI framework.
*   **React Hooks for State and Lifecycle Management**: `useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useSearchParams` are frequently employed patterns for managing component state, optimizing performance, handling side effects, accessing DOM elements, and interacting with URL parameters.
*   **Redux for Global State Management**: The presence of `useSelector` and `useDispatch` in `Calendar.tsx` and the later addition in `Files.tsx` (for error handling) points to a Redux-based state management strategy for application-wide concerns.
*   **Modular Component Design**: The separation of concerns is evident with `Files.tsx` handling the overall file view and `FileManagerGrid.tsx` focusing on the display logic, and `CalendarModule` being an independent component integrated into `Calendar.tsx`.
*   **Iterative Development and Refactoring**: The pattern of commenting out large blocks of code, then re-introducing and refining them (especially in `Files.tsx`), suggests an active and iterative development process, likely involving transitions from mock data to live API integration.
*   **API Integration with Axios**: The use of `axios` for fetching data from a `ROOT_URL` in `Files.tsx` signifies a clear pattern of backend communication for data retrieval, requiring authorization headers.
*   **Shared Utilities**: Imports from `@mike-clm/shared` for utilities like `setCalendarFilters`, `setFilterApplied`, `setTeamFilterKeys`, `setError`, `useUserData`, and `convertDate` indicate a shared codebase for common functionalities and Redux slices across the application.
*   **Network Status Awareness**: The introduction of `useOnlineStatus` suggests future features might consider the user's network connectivity.

## 1:43:00 PM
The code changes primarily occurred between the late evening of January 17, 2026, and the early afternoon of January 18, 2026, indicating a focused development period. The most significant theme is a **major refactoring and enhancement of the ERP system to specialize in real estate transactions and improve accounting features**.

Here's a file-specific summary:

**c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\server.js**
*   **Timestamp:** 1/17/2026, 5:23:52 PM (initial state), 1/18/2026, 11:45:36 AM, 1/18/2026, 11:46:11 AM, 1/18/2026, 1:14:48 PM, 1/18/2026, 1:16:55 PM.
*   **Changes:** The server setup remained largely consistent throughout the logs.

    *   **Stock Management:** `openingStock` and `currentStock` were adjusted, with `currentStock` defaulting to `openingStock` or 1.
    *   **Pricing:** `sellingPrice` and `purchasePrice` were replaced by `ratePerUnit` and `totalPrice`.
    *   **Indexing:** New indexes were added for `status`, `propertyType`, and `location.city` to support efficient querying of real estate properties.

**c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\routes\items.js**
*   **Timestamp:** 1/18/2026, 12:55:26 AM
*   **Changes:** A complete rewrite from a generic CRUD factory pattern to direct route handler implementations.
    *   **New Endpoint:** Added `/for-sales` to fetch items specifically for sales/purchase dropdowns, filtering by `showInSales`, `isActive`, and `status` ('Available', 'Ready to Move').
    *   **Enhanced Filtering:** The `GET /` endpoint now supports filtering by `projectName`, `propertyType`, `status`, and `isActive` in addition to existing filters.
    *   **CRUD Logic Integration:** The `create` and `update` endpoints now handle the complex real estate-specific fields defined in the `Item` model, including logic to update `currentStock` and `status`.
    *   **Authorization:** The `user-panel` role was added to `getAll`, `getOne`, and `for-sales` endpoints, suggesting a new user interface or client access level.
    *   **Validation:** The explicit `itemValidation` middleware was removed, implying validation might be handled within the route logic or by Mongoose schema validation.
    *   **Socket Notifications:** `sendNotification` is used for item creation.

**c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\models\Purchase.js**
*   **Timestamp:** 1/18/2026, 12:56:24 AM
*   **Changes:** Underwent significant expansion. The previous schema was commented out.
    *   **Purchase Items:** `purchaseItemSchema` now references `Item` by `itemId` and includes real estate-specific details like `propertyType`, `projectName`, and `area`. `qty` min value changed to 1.
    *   **Vendor Details:** Added `vendorContact` (phone, email, address).
    *   **Financial Details:** Introduced `cgst`, `sgst`, `igst` for detailed GST tracking, `paymentStatus` (Pending, Partial, Paid), `amountPaid`, `balanceAmount`, and additional `paymentMode` options.
    *   **Notes:** A `notes` field was added.
    *   **Auto-generation:** A static method `generatePurchaseNo` was added to automatically generate purchase numbers.
    *   **Indexing:** New indexes for `paymentStatus` and `items.itemId` were added.

**c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\routes\purchases.js**
*   **Timestamp:** 1/18/2026, 12:57:10 AM
*   **Changes:** Rewritten from a generic CRUD factory, similar to `items.js`.
    *   **Enhanced Filtering:** The `GET /` endpoint gained filters for `paymentStatus`, `isActive`, and date ranges (`fromDate`, `toDate`). Populate options were expanded to include item details.
    *   **Create/Update Logic:** The `create` endpoint now automatically generates `purchaseNo` if not provided, validates and enriches `items` (potentially creating new `Item` entries if a new property is being purchased), and updates item `currentStock`. The `update` endpoint handles reverting old item stock and updating new item stock based on changes.
    *   **Payment Updates:** A new `PATCH /:id/payment` route was introduced to specifically handle updates to `amountPaid` and `paymentMode`.
    *   **Authorization:** The `user-panel` role was added to `getAll`, `getOne` endpoints.

*   **Timestamp:** 1/18/2026, 12:59:07 AM
*   **Changes:** Rewritten from a generic CRUD factory, similar to `purchases.js`.
    *   **Enhanced Filtering:** The `GET /` endpoint gained filters for `paymentStatus`, `isActive`, and date ranges (`fromDate`, `toDate`). Populate options were expanded to include item details.
    *   **Create/Update Logic:** The `create` endpoint now automatically generates `invoiceNo`, validates `items` (checking if an item is already sold), and crucially updates the `Item`'s `status` to 'Sold' or 'Booked' and sets `currentStock` to 0. The `update` endpoint includes logic to restore old item status and stock when items are changed, then update new items.
    *   **Payment Updates:** A new `PATCH /:id/payment` route was introduced for payment updates, also updating the related `Item`'s status and stock.
    *   **Authorization:** The `user-panel` role was added to `getAll`, `getOne` endpoints.
    *   **Socket Notifications:** `sendNotification` is used for sales creation and updates.

**c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\models\AccountGroup.js**
*   **Timestamp:** 1/18/2026, 1:00:55 AM
*   **Changes:** Significant update from a commented-out previous version.
    *   **Chart of Accounts Integration:** Added `chartOfAccountId` referencing a new `ChartOfAccount` model.
    *   **New Fields:** Introduced `pan`, `creditLimit`, expanded `defaultPaymentMode` to include 'UPI' and 'Cheque'.
    *   **Contact & Balance:** Added a `contact` object (phone, email, address, city, state, pincode) and `openingBalance` object (amount, type).
    *   **Indexing:** A new index for `chartOfAccountId` was added.

**c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\routes\accountGroups.js**
*   **Timestamps:** 1/18/2026, 1:01:39 AM, 1/18/2026, 1:05:58 AM.
*   **Changes:** Rewritten from a generic CRUD factory.
    *   **Chart of Accounts Interaction:** `create` and `update` endpoints now validate the existence of the referenced `ChartOfAccount`.
    *   **Enhanced Filtering:** The `GET /` endpoint supports filtering by `chartOfAccountId` and `isActive`. Populate options were expanded to include Chart of Account details.
    *   **New Endpoint:** Added a `PATCH /:id/toggle-status` route to switch the `isActive` status of an account group.
    *   **Authorization:** The `user-panel` role was added to `getAll`, `getOne` endpoints.
    *   The 1:05:58 AM timestamp shows identical code to the 1:01:39 AM version, indicating a save.

**c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\routes\chartOfAccounts.js**
*   **Timestamps:** 1/18/2026, 11:47:04 AM (initial creation), 1/18/2026, 11:47:13 AM, 1/18/2026, 1:12:33 PM, 1/18/2026, 1:13:30 PM, 1/18/2026, 1:13:35 PM, 1/18/2026, 1:14:17 PM, 1/18/2026, 1:17:15 PM, 1/18/2026, 1:17:25 PM, 1/18/2026, 1:20:10 PM.
*   **Changes:**
    *   **Initial Creation:** The file was initially created on January 18th at 11:47:04 AM, establishing CRUD routes (`getAllGroups`, `getGroup`, `createGroup`, `updateGroup`, `deleteGroup`) for Chart of Accounts, utilizing a `chartOfAccountController`.
    *   **Authorization:** All routes are protected by `authenticate` middleware, and further `authorize` roles are defined (e.g., 'admin', 'branch', 'user-panel').
    *   **Temporary Change:** At 1:17:25 PM, the `GET /` (getAllGroups) route was temporarily commented out, then restored at 1:20:10 PM.
    *   Multiple identical code entries are present, indicating frequent saves.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Real Estate Specialization:** The most prominent pattern is the transformation of the ERP into a real estate management system, specifically seen in the `Item` model (now representing properties) and the intricate logic in `purchases.js` and `sales.js` to handle property acquisition, sales, stock, and status updates.
2.  **Move from Generic CRUD to Custom Logic:** Several route files (Items, Purchases, Sales, Account Groups) were refactored from using a generic `createCRUDController` to implementing direct, often complex, CRUD logic. This suggests a need for more tailored business rules, validations, and interactions with other models.
3.  **Enhanced Accounting/Financial Modules:** The `AccountGroup` model received substantial financial and contact detail enhancements, and `server.js` was updated to include `ChartOfAccount` routes, indicating a more robust accounting backend.
4.  **Improved Data Management and Filtering:** Across multiple API routes, filtering capabilities were greatly expanded to include new real estate and financial-specific criteria, alongside consistent use of pagination utilities.
5.  **Role-Based Access Control Expansion:** The `authorize` middleware is consistently used, and the addition of the `user-panel` role across various `GET` endpoints points to the development of a user-facing dashboard or application.
6.  **Real-time Notifications:** The integration of socket notifications for significant events (item created, purchase/sale created/updated) in `items.js`, `purchases.js`, and `sales.js` highlights a focus on real-time communication within the system.
7.  **Auto-Generation of IDs:** `Purchase` and `Sales` models now include static methods to automatically generate unique `purchaseNo` and `invoiceNo`, improving data consistency.
8.  **Frequent Saving:** The large number of log entries with identical or minimal changes in `server.js` and `routes\chartOfAccounts.js` indicates a development workflow with very frequent saves.

## 2:42:56 PM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancements and refactoring within the `MikeCLM` frontend application, particularly in file management and calendar functionalities, with a noticeable shift towards API integration and robust state management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (1/16/2026, 3:08:21 PM):** The `Files` component was responsible for displaying, searching, sorting, paginating, downloading, and deleting contract files. It used React state (`useState`, `useMemo`) for managing UI elements like search text, selected items, pagination, and sorting order. File data was initially hardcoded as mock `FilesListItem` objects. Ant Design components were heavily utilized for UI.
    *   **Debugging & Minor Additions (1/16/2026, 6:00:06 PM - 1/16/2026, 6:00:25 PM):** Small changes were made to retrieve `access_token` from `localStorage` and log it to the console, likely for debugging purposes.
    *   **Major Refactor to API Integration (1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM):** This was a significant update where the component transitioned from using mock data to fetching actual data from an API.
        *   The hardcoded `files` state was replaced with an empty array.
        *   New React hooks (`useEffect`, `useSearchParams`) and the `axios` library were imported.
        *   An `useEffect` hook was introduced to fetch files from `${ROOT_URL}/contract-documents` based on a `document_id` obtained from URL search parameters. This API call included an `Authorization` header with the `access_token`.
        *   Error handling for API calls using `message.error` was added.
        *   The previous local state for files was effectively replaced by data fetched from the backend.
    *   **Subsequent Refinements and New Imports (1/17/2026, 1:49:00 PM - 1/17/2026, 3:49:52 PM):** This period shows a series of updates, often involving commenting out previous code blocks (possibly for temporary disabling or as a versioning method) while adding new features to the active code.
        *   Imports for `useRef`, `useOnlineStatus` (a custom hook), `useDispatch`, `setError`, and `useUserData` (from `@mike-clm/shared`) were added, indicating an expansion of features including online status detection and deeper Redux integration for error handling and user data.
        *   A `LoaderType` enum was introduced, suggesting plans for more granular loading state management.
        *   The `FilesListItem` interface remained consistent, but new types like `UploadStatusItem` were added later (1/17/2026, 4:13:59 PM), hinting at upcoming upload functionality.
    *   **Final Stage (1/17/2026, 3:53:50 PM - 1/17/2026, 4:13:59 PM):** Additional utilities like `convertDate` from `@mike-clm/shared` were imported.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\Calendar\Calendar.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (1/16/2026, 5:08:58 PM):** The `Calendar` container managed calendar event filters (`pendingFilters`, `pendingTypeFilters`) using React state and integrated with Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for global state management. It defined a set of `allFilters` for different contract event types. The `CalendarModule` component was initially commented out, effectively disabling the main calendar display.
    *   **Activation of Calendar Module (1/16/2026, 5:09:13 PM):** The `CalendarModule` component was uncommented, making it an active part of the Calendar UI and passing down necessary props for filtering and event display.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (1/17/2026, 11:44:29 AM):** This component was initially fully commented out. The commented code revealed a sophisticated file management grid capable of displaying files in a hierarchical folder-like structure, handling file/folder selection, and integrating with delete/edit/download actions via modals. It derived its file/folder tree structure from the `filesData` prop using `useMemo`.
    *   **Activation (1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM):** The entire `FileManagerGrid` component was uncommented, bringing its advanced file/folder display and interaction capabilities online.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\utils\functions\useOnlineStatus.ts`**
    *   **New Utility Hook (1/17/2026, 1:54:26 PM):** A new utility file was created to introduce `useOnlineStatus`, a custom React hook. This hook provides a stateful value `isOnline` that reflects the browser's network connectivity, updating it based on `window.online` and `window.offline` events. It also includes a check for server-side rendering environments.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM:** Major architectural shift in `Files.tsx` from mock data to API integration using `axios` and `useEffect`.
*   **1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM:** Activation of the `FileManagerGrid.tsx` component, introducing complex file/folder tree rendering and interaction.
*   **1/17/2026, 1:54:26 PM:** Creation of the `useOnlineStatus` utility hook.
*   **1/17/2026, throughout the afternoon:** Continuous integration of new hooks (`useRef`, `useOnlineStatus`), Redux actions (`setError`), and data utilities (`convertDate`, `useUserData`) into `Files.tsx`, along with new type definitions (`LoaderType`, `UploadStatusItem`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Ant Design:** Consistent use of Ant Design components for a unified UI across different parts of the application.
*   **React Hooks:** Heavy reliance on `useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect` for managing component state, performance optimization, and side effects. `useRef` and custom hooks (`useOnlineStatus`) are also introduced.
*   **Redux Integration:** The use of `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, and Redux actions (`setCalendarFilters`, `setFilterApplied`, `setTeamFilterKeys`, `setError`, `useUserData` from `@mike-clm/shared`) indicates a strong commitment to centralized state management.
*   **API-Driven Development:** A clear pattern of moving from hardcoded/mock data to fetching data from a backend API using `axios`, along with handling authentication (`access_token`).
*   **Modular Component Design:** Components like `Files` and `FileManagerGrid` are structured to handle specific UI and data logic, often with a clear separation of concerns.
*   **Iterative Development/Experimentation:** The frequent commenting/uncommenting of large code blocks, particularly in `Files.tsx` and `FileManagerGrid.tsx`, suggests an iterative development process, possibly involving temporary disabling of features or testing alternative implementations.
*   **Debugging:** Repeated `console.log` statements for `access_token` point to ongoing debugging efforts related to authentication or API calls.
*   **Shared Utilities:** The `@mike-clm/shared` library is a recurring import source for Redux actions, hooks, and utility functions, indicating a shared codebase for common functionalities.

## 2:43:16 PM
The code changes primarily indicate a significant evolution of an ERP system, moving towards a more specialized focus on real estate or property management, alongside a refactoring of core modules and the integration of a Chart of Accounts system.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\server.js`**
    *   **Initial Setup (1/17/2026, 5:23:52 PM):** This file shows the initial configuration of the Express server, including middleware for security (Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting), logging (Morgan), database connection, Socket.IO initialization, and Swagger UI for API documentation. It registers a wide array of API routes for various ERP functionalities.
    *   **Chart of Accounts Integration (1/18/2026, 11:45:36 AM):** A new route, `/api/chart-of-accounts`, was introduced, linking to `chartOfAccountRoutes`. This route was then repeatedly commented out and re-added (1/18/2026, 2:14:12 PM to 2:18:33 PM), suggesting ongoing development and integration challenges or testing for this new module.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\models\Item.js` (1/18/2026, 12:54:50 AM)**
    *   Underwent a complete overhaul. The original generic `itemSchema` was replaced with one highly specialized for real estate properties.
    *   New fields include `propertyType` (enum for Plot, Flat, Shop, etc.), `projectName`, detailed `location` and `area` specifications, `dimensions`, `ratePerUnit`, `totalPrice`, `bookingAmount`, `status` (Available, Sold, Booked), `floorNumber`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `parking`, `amenities`, `description`, and `legalDetails` (e.g., RERA number).
    *   It now also supports `images` and `documents` arrays.
    *   Stock fields (`openingStock`, `currentStock`) have a default of 1, appropriate for unique properties.
    *   New indexes were added for `status`, `propertyType`, and `location.city`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\routes\items.js` (1/18/2026, 12:55:26 AM)**
    *   The route handling was entirely rewritten, replacing a factory pattern with explicit route definitions.
    *   `authenticate` middleware is now applied globally to all item routes.
    *   GET endpoints were enhanced with new filters based on the updated `Item` schema (`propertyType`, `status`, `isActive`) and search now includes `projectName`.
    *   A new route, `GET /for-sales`, was added to retrieve items suitable for sales/purchase listings, filtering by `showInSales`, `isActive`, and specific `status` values.
    *   The `POST` route for item creation no longer uses a validation library (`itemValidation` was removed) and directly processes numerous new real estate-specific fields. It also now emits `ITEM_CREATED` socket notifications.
    *   The `DELETE /:id` route was removed, suggesting that items are now likely deactivated rather than permanently deleted.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\models\Purchase.js` (1/18/2026, 12:56:24 AM)**
    *   The `purchaseSchema` was entirely redefined.
    *   `purchaseItemSchema` now references `itemId` from the `Item` model and includes property-specific details (`propertyType`, `projectName`, `area`).
    *   New fields were added to the main `purchaseSchema` for `vendorContact`, detailed GST fields (`cgst`, `sgst`, `igst`), comprehensive payment status (`paymentStatus`, `amountPaid`, `balanceAmount`), `paymentMode` (expanded enum), and `notes`.
    *   A static method `generatePurchaseNo` was introduced for automatic purchase number generation.
    *   New indexes were added for `paymentStatus` and `items.itemId`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\routes\purchases.js` (1/18/2026, 12:57:10 AM)**
    *   The route handlers were completely rewritten, moving away from a generic CRUD controller.
    *   GET endpoints support new filters (`paymentStatus`, `isActive`, `fromDate`, `toDate`) and expanded population of related models.
    *   The `POST` route for creating purchases now includes complex logic: it can either link to an existing `Item` or **create a new `Item` entry if a new property is being purchased through this transaction**. It also updates the `currentStock` and `status` of the associated `Item`.
    *   The `PUT` route for updating purchases includes logic to revert previous item stock changes and apply new ones when the items array is modified.
    *   A new `PATCH /:id/payment` route was added to specifically handle partial payment updates for purchases.
    *   The `DELETE /:id` route was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\models\Sales.js` (1/18/2026, 12:58:38 AM)**
    *   The `salesSchema` was entirely redefined, mirroring the `Purchase` model's enhancements.
    *   `salesItemSchema` now references `itemId` from the `Item` model and includes property-specific details.
    *   New fields were added for `customerContact`, detailed GST fields, comprehensive payment status, `paymentMode` (expanded enum including 'EMI'), and `notes`.
    *   A static method `generateInvoiceNo` was introduced for automatic invoice number generation.
    *   New indexes were added for `paymentStatus` and `items.itemId`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\routes\sales.js` (1/18/2026, 12:59:07 AM)**
    *   The route handlers were completely rewritten, moving away from a generic CRUD controller.
    *   GET endpoints support new filters (`paymentStatus`, `isActive`, `fromDate`, `toDate`) and expanded population.
    *   The `POST` route for creating sales now validates item availability (checking `status` and preventing sale of already sold items). It updates the associated `Item`'s `status` to 'Sold' or 'Booked' and sets `currentStock` to 0.
    *   The `PUT` route for updating sales includes logic to revert previous item status/stock and apply new ones when the items array is modified.
    *   A new `PATCH /:id/payment` route was added to specifically handle partial payment updates for sales and updates the item status accordingly.
    *   The `DELETE /:id` route was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\models\AccountGroup.js` (1/18/2026, 1:00:55 AM)**
    *   The `accountGroupSchema` was entirely redefined.
    *   A new required field, `chartOfAccountId` (referencing a `ChartOfAccount` model), was added, indicating integration with an accounting system.
    *   Additional fields include `pan`, `creditLimit`, detailed `contact` information, and `openingBalance` with a `type` (Debit/Credit).
    *   `defaultPaymentMode` enum was expanded.
    *   A new index for `chartOfAccountId` was added.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\routes\accountGroups.js` (1/18/2026, 1:01:39 AM & 1:05:58 AM)**
    *   The route handlers were completely rewritten, no longer using a validation library and directly processing new fields.
    *   GET endpoints support new filters (`chartOfAccountId`, `isActive`) and expanded population, including details from `ChartOfAccount`.
    *   `POST` and `PUT` routes now include validation for the existence of the referenced `ChartOfAccount`.
    *   A new `PATCH /:id/toggle-status` route was added to activate/deactivate account groups.
    *   The `DELETE /:id` route was removed. The `1:05:58 AM` timestamp appears to be an identical re-save.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\SALES_ERP\routes\chartOfAccounts.js`**
    *   **Initial creation (1/18/2026, 11:47:04 AM):** This file was created to define routes for managing Chart of Accounts groups (get all/single, create, update, delete). It uses `authenticate` and `authorize` middleware with specific role checks.
    *   **Frequent Modifications (1/18/2026, 1:12:33 PM to 2:42:12 PM):** This file shows a series of rapid changes, including minor path adjustments (`.js` extension toggling), extensive commenting/uncommenting of routes, adding and removing a temporary `/hello` test endpoint, changing how the controller is imported (full object vs. destructured function), adding `console.log` statements, and commenting out middleware within routes. This strongly suggests active debugging, testing, and potentially refactoring around the Chart of Accounts module's integration.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Massive Refactoring & Modernization:** A consistent pattern across `models` and `routes` is the commenting out of older code (often factory-based or simpler schemas) and its replacement with new, more detailed, and explicitly defined implementations. This indicates a significant architectural overhaul.
2.  **Shift to Real Estate Domain:** The most prominent change is the deep integration of real estate-specific fields and logic into the `Item`, `Purchase`, and `Sales` modules, including property types, locations, areas, legal details, and specialized stock/status management. This suggests the ERP is being tailored for a real estate business.
3.  **Enhanced Financial & Accounting Detail:** New fields for detailed payment statuses, GST components, vendor/customer contact, credit limits, and opening balances were added to `Purchase`, `Sales`, and `AccountGroup` models. The introduction of `ChartOfAccount` integration signifies a move towards more robust financial accounting within the ERP.
4.  **Improved API Functionality:** Routes now offer more granular filtering options, better data population, and explicit handling of business logic (e.g., auto-generating numbers, stock updates, item status changes). Many `DELETE` endpoints were removed, indicating a preference for soft deletion or status toggling (`isActive` field, `toggle-status` patch route) rather than permanent data removal.
5.  **Role-Based Access Control Expansion:** The `authorize` middleware consistently adds a 'user-panel' role to GET requests across many routes, suggesting new user roles or an expanded front-end requiring access to read data.
6.  **Socket.IO Integration:** Socket notifications are used for `ITEM_CREATED`, `PURCHASE_CREATED`, and `SALE_CREATED` events, implying real-time updates are a key feature of the system.
7.  **Debugging & Iterative Development:** The repeated commenting/uncommenting and introduction of test routes in `routes/chartOfAccounts.js`, along with similar, albeit less frequent, changes in `server.js`, highlight an active and iterative development process, especially for the newer Chart of Accounts module.

In summary, the changes reflect a comprehensive upgrade of the ERP, specializing it for the real estate sector, enhancing its financial features, and improving its overall API design and real-time capabilities.

## 3:43:07 PM
The changes log details updates across several frontend application files, primarily focusing on file management and calendar features, along with developer environment settings.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (1/16/2026, 3:08:21 PM):** The component was set up with React states (`searchText`, `selectedIds`, `currentPage`, `sortOrder`) and an initially hardcoded list of `FilesListItem` objects. It included basic functionalities like searching, downloading, deleting (client-side state manipulation), and sorting. The UI was built with Ant Design components and displayed either a file grid or an "empty state" message.
    *   **Minor Debugging Additions (1/16/2026, 6:00:06 PM - 6:00:25 PM):** Small changes were introduced to retrieve `access_token` from `localStorage` and `console.log` its value, indicating active debugging.
    *   **Major Refactor Attempt & Reversion (1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM - 1:51:48 PM):** A significant change occurred at 11:43:50 AM, where the component was refactored to dynamically fetch files using `axios` and `useSearchParams` (to get a `document_id` from the URL), replacing the hardcoded file list. However, in subsequent logs from 1:49:00 PM to 1:51:48 PM, the entire component (including new imports and API fetching logic) appears to have been commented out, and the previous version with the hardcoded file list was effectively restored. This indicates a rollback or a temporary state.
    *   **Incremental Import Additions (1/17/2026, 1:55:09 PM - 4:13:59 PM):** Following the reversion, a series of small, consecutive updates added new imports even though their associated logic was not present in the active (reverted) component code. These additions included:
        *   `useOnlineStatus` (initially with incorrect paths, then corrected).
        *   `useDispatch` from `react-redux`.
        *   `setError`, `useUserData`, `convertDate` from `@mike-clm/shared`.
        *   A new type definition `LoaderType` was introduced.
        *   The latest timestamp (4:13:59 PM) also added `interface UploadStatusItem`.
    *   The `files` state continued to be hardcoded throughout these later updates, despite the imports for dynamic fetching being present.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\Calendar\Calendar.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (1/16/2026, 5:08:58 PM):** This component managed calendar filters using Redux (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and local states. It defined various contract-related filters (`contract_start`, `contract_end`, etc.). Critically, the `CalendarModule` component (presumably the main calendar display) was commented out.
    *   **Activation of Calendar Module (1/16/2026, 5:09:13 PM):** The `CalendarModule` component was uncommented and integrated into the render, making the calendar display functional with the applied filters.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx`**
    *   **Commented Out (1/17/2026, 11:44:29 AM):** The entire component was commented out, potentially in response to the refactoring attempt in `Files.tsx` at a similar timestamp. This includes all its logic for displaying files and folders, handling selection, and modals.
    *   **Uncommented and Restored (1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM):** The component was fully uncommented and restored. It implements a file manager grid with nested folder structure derived from file titles, checkbox selection for files and folders (including indeterminate states), and actions for download, edit, and delete, along with a `DeleteModal`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\utils\functions\useOnlineStatus.ts`**
    *   **New File (1/17/2026, 1:54:26 PM):** A new utility hook `useOnlineStatus` was introduced. It tracks the browser's online/offline status using `navigator.onLine` and `window` event listeners, including an SSR guard.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json`**
    *   **VS Code Configuration (1/17/2026, 1:55:59 PM):** This log entry details numerous VS Code settings, indicating a developer configuring their environment. Key settings cover theme (`Visual Studio Dark - C++`), code runner behavior, editor features (mouse wheel zoom, accessibility off), Live Server settings, Python formatting, JavaScript import updates, Git integration (`git-graph`, `gitlens`), auto-save (`off`), and default formatters (Prettier, TypeScript language features for JavaScript/React, HTML language features for HTML).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/16/2026, 5:09:13 PM:** `CalendarModule` was activated in `Calendar.tsx`.
*   **1/17/2026, 11:43:50 AM:** `Files.tsx` underwent a major attempt to switch from static data to dynamic API fetching.
*   **1/17/2026, 1:49:00 PM (and subsequent):** `Files.tsx` reverted its API fetching logic, returning to a hardcoded data source.
*   **1/17/2026, 11:47:00 AM:** `FileManagerGrid.tsx` was fully uncommented and restored, indicating a functional file grid.
*   **1/17/2026, 1:54:26 PM:** New utility hook `useOnlineStatus` was introduced.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Ant Design:** The UI components frequently utilize the Ant Design library.
*   **React Hooks:** Heavy reliance on `useState`, `useMemo`, and `useEffect` for component logic and state management.
*   **Redux Integration:** `Calendar.tsx` uses `useSelector` and `useDispatch` for Redux state management, and `Files.tsx` later imports `useDispatch` and `setError` (from `@mike-clm/shared`), suggesting future or partial Redux integration.
*   **Inconsistent Development Workflow (in `Files.tsx`):** A recurring pattern in `Files.tsx` is the commenting out and uncommenting of large code blocks, and the introduction of imports for features (like API fetching or global state management) that aren't immediately implemented or appear to be reverted in the main component logic. This suggests an iterative or somewhat uncommitted approach to feature development and/or a confusing commit history.
*   **External Data Fetching:** An intention to use `axios` for fetching data (seen in `Files.tsx`'s brief API integration attempt).
*   **Developer Environment Configuration:** One entry highlights a developer actively tailoring their VS Code settings for project-specific needs, including formatting and language features.
