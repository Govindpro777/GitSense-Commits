The `FileManagerGridItem.jsx` file, updated on 1/13/2026 at 1:00:02 AM, defines a React component responsible for displaying a single file item within a file management interface.

Key updates and features in this component include:
*   **Display of File Information:** It renders details such as the file title, creator, size, and last modification date.
*   **Dynamic File Type Icons:** The component dynamically displays an icon corresponding to the file's extension, utilizing an `iconObj` for mapping.
*   **Action Buttons:** It provides buttons for common file operations:
    *   **Preview:** Allows users to preview the file.
    *   **Edit File Name:** Conditionally rendered based on `permissions?.edit_case_document`, enabling users to modify the file's name.
    *   **Download:** Facilitates downloading the file.
    *   **Delete:** Conditionally rendered based on `permissions?.delete_case_document`, allowing users to delete the file.
*   **Permissions-Based Rendering:** The "Edit File Name" and "Delete" buttons are only visible if the user has the necessary permissions.
*   **Event Tracking Integration:** The component integrates with `@case-track-mono/Utils` to track user interactions. Specifically, "Preview File" and "Download File" button clicks are logged with associated `buttonName` and `entityId` using `trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED)`.

A recurring pattern in the component is the use of the `handleModal` prop to trigger various modal actions (preview, edit, download, delete) across different button clicks, centralizing modal management.
