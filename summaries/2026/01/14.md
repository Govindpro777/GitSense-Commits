# Activity Summary for 1/14/2026

## 2:27:25 PM
The `FileManagerGridItem.jsx` file, updated on 1/13/2026 at 1:00:02 AM, defines a React component responsible for displaying a single file item within a file management interface.

Key updates and features in this component include:
*   **Display of File Information:** It renders details such as the file title, creator, size, and last modification date.
*   **Dynamic File Type Icons:** The component dynamically displays an icon corresponding to the file's extension, utilizing an `iconObj` for mapping.
*   **Action Buttons:** It provides buttons for common file operations:
    *   **Preview:** Allows users to preview the file.
    *   **Edit File Name:** Conditionally rendered based on `permissions?.edit_case_document`, enabling users to modify the file's name.
    *   **Download:** Facilitates downloading the file.
    *   **Delete:** Conditionally rendered based on `permissions?.delete_case_document`, allowing users to delete the file.
*   **Permissions-Based Rendering:** The "Edit File Name" and "Delete" buttons are only visible if the user has the necessary permissions.
*   **Event Tracking Integration:** The component integrates with `@case-track-mono/Utils` to track user interactions. Specifically, "Preview File" and "Download File" button clicks are logged with associated `buttonName` and `entityId` using `trackWeb(EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED)`.

A recurring pattern in the component is the use of the `handleModal` prop to trigger various modal actions (preview, edit, download, delete) across different button clicks, centralizing modal management.

This log primarily details front-end development, specifically focusing on the file management feature within a "MikeCLM" application. The changes are concentrated on styling (SCSS files) and component logic (TypeScript files) related to displaying and interacting with files and folders in a grid/tree view.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesComponent\FileGirdItem2.scss` (Multiple updates, e.g., 1/14/2026, 11:28:10 AM, 11:32:08 AM, 11:47:14 AM, 1:12:10 PM, 1:12:19 PM, 1:32:35 PM, 1:50:34 PM, 1:54:15 PM)**
    *   **Initial change (11:28:10 AM):** Uncomments and refactors the `.files-grid-item-2` styles. It changes the layout from a commented-out flexible row-based structure to a column-based flex container with defined padding, border, border-radius, background, and transition. It introduces hover and selected states, `item-row`, `custom-checkbox`, `item-content`, `file-info`, `action-section`, `action-label`, `action-buttons`, and `file-list-item` styles.
    *   **Later changes (e.g., 1:12:10 PM, 1:12:19 PM, 1:50:34 PM, 1:54:15 PM):** Primarily involve commenting/uncommenting `padding` and `margin-bottom` properties within the `.files-grid-item-2` class, indicating fine-tuning of spacing for this specific grid item. The overall structure and styling remain consistent.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesComponent\FileGirdItem.scss` (Multiple updates, e.g., 1/14/2026, 11:30:04 AM, 11:30:24 AM, 11:30:39 AM, 11:31:27 AM, 11:31:36 AM, 11:31:48 AM, 11:46:34 AM, 12:42:42 PM, 12:42:53 PM, 12:43:00 PM, 2:23:59 PM, 2:24:09 PM, 2:26:23 PM)**
    *   **Initial changes (around 11:30 AM - 11:46 AM):** Define styles for `.files-grid-item`, including `flex-direction`, padding, border, border-radius, background, and transitions. It also defines `hover` and `selected` states. Key structural elements are `.card-header` (with checkbox and file title) and `.card-body` (using a grid layout for info columns). An `.action-button` class is added within `.info-column`.
    *   **Later changes (around 12:42 PM):** Involve commenting/uncommenting the `padding` and `gap` properties of the main `.files-grid-item`, suggesting attempts to adjust spacing or remove redundant styles.
    *   **Latest changes (around 2:23 PM - 2:26 PM):** Update the `color` property for `.info-label` and `info-value` within `.card-body`, changing from `#8C9BAB` to `#465364` (for label) and `#1F3044` to `#15273B` (for value), indicating a refinement of text colors for better readability or brand consistency.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesGirdItem2.tsx` (Single update, 1/14/2026, 11:47:07 AM)**
    *   This new component, `FilesGridItem2`, is introduced. It imports React, Ant Design `Checkbox`, and several custom icons (`DownloadIcon`, `DeleteIcon`, `EditOutlined`). It also imports `ListFileItem` and its corresponding SCSS file.
    *   The component defines `File` and `FilesGridItemProps` interfaces, specifying the expected data structure and props (file, checked status, and action callbacks).
    *   The `FilesGridItem2` component renders a file item with a checkbox, file name (using `ListFileItem`), and action buttons (Edit, Download, Delete). It applies a `selected` class based on the `checked` prop.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx` (Multiple updates, e.g., 1/14/2026, 11:49:45 AM to 12:55:21 PM)**
    *   **Initial state (11:49:45 AM):** The file is entirely commented out, suggesting it was either undergoing a major rewrite or being temporarily disabled. It contained a comprehensive file manager grid component with tree view logic, modal handling (edit, delete, preview), file/folder size utilities, and rendering of `FilesGridItem` and `FilesGridItem2`. It included state for selected files, expanded folders, and loading states.
    *   **Uncommenting and Refinement (12:21:16 PM onwards):** The entire component is uncommented and becomes active.
        *   Imports are updated to include `Checkbox` from `antd` and custom icons (`DownOutlined`, `UpOutlined`, `DownloadIcon`, `DeleteIcon`). A temporary `UploadOutlined` import from `apps/MikeCLM/src/assets` is added (12:22:37 PM) but likely unused.
        *   The tree rendering logic in `TreeRow` is streamlined, removing unused `parseSizeToBytes`, `formatBytes`, `calculateFolderSizeBytes`, `folderLoading`, `handleFolderDownload`, `handleFolderDelete`, `handleDeleteSubmit`, and `handleUpdate` functions and related states/props that were present in the commented version.
        *   The `TreeRow` component's `paddingLeft` for indentation is removed, relying solely on CSS for indentation.
        *   The structure for displaying folder information (`root-folder-meta`) is adjusted, specifically adding an "Action" block for root folders (12:33:41 PM, 12:34:09 PM, 12:34:44 PM).
        *   A `className="tree-row-header"` is added to the clickable div in `TreeRow` (1:52:17 PM), which was previously missing.
        *   The `root-file-item` class is sometimes removed and re-added, indicating trial-and-error in styling or placement of individual files not within folders.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\assets\common\UpOutlined.tsx` (Multiple updates, e.g., 1/14/2026, 12:25:30 PM, 12:25:39 PM)**
    *   This new file introduces a custom SVG component for an "Up" arrow icon, indicating a move from Ant Design's default icons to custom assets for specific visual consistency.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\fileManagerGrid.scss` (Multiple updates, e.g., 1/14/2026, 11:59:13 AM to 1:53:53 PM)**
    *   **Initial state (11:59:13 AM):** The entire file is commented out, similar to `FileManagerGrid.tsx`.
    *   **Uncommenting and Refinement (11:59:13 AM onwards):** The file is progressively uncommented and styling adjustments are made.
        *   Various `gap` properties (e.g., in `.content-manager-grid`, `.folder-tree-container`, `.root-files-container`) are frequently changed (e.g., `16px` to `8px`, `10px`, `6px`, and back), indicating iterative design adjustments for spacing.
        *   `margin-bottom` for `.root-file-item` and `.tree-row` is also frequently tweaked (e.g., `2px` to `3px`, `0px`, then back to `2px` or `6px`, `10px`).
        *   `padding` for `.tree-row` is adjusted from `16px` to `14px`.
        *   The `border` property for `.content-manager-grid` is added at `12:51:57 PM` then sometimes removed or added to `.tree-row` instead, suggesting uncertainty about where the main container border should apply. Eventually, it seems to stabilize without the outer border for `content-manager-grid` and with the border on `.tree-row` (1:57:43 PM).
        *   Comments are frequently added/removed for various style properties, indicating active testing and temporary disabling of styles.
        *   `margin-top` for `.tree-file-wrapper` within `.tree-children` is adjusted from `2px` to `6px` and then `8px` (1:53:17 PM, 1:53:30 PM, 1:53:35 PM, 1:53:43 PM, 1:53:53 PM), suggesting adjustments to vertical spacing of nested file items.
        *   `margin-top` for `.tree-children` is commented out (1:53:30 PM), indicating a decision to remove explicit top margin for the children container.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\files.scss` (Multiple updates, e.g., 1/14/2026, 12:38:10 PM to 12:41:56 PM)**
    *   Minor adjustments to `padding-bottom` (removed), `margin-bottom` for `.files-pagination` (changed from `24px` to `12px`), and `margin-bottom` for `.files-grid` (changed from `20px` to `8px`). A `margin-bottom` property for `.files-select-all` is temporarily commented out and then restored. These changes are mostly related to overall page layout and spacing.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx` (Multiple updates, e.g., 1/14/2026, 1:27:51 PM, 1:28:08 PM)**
    *   The `Files` component introduces dummy `files` data.
    *   A `file` object with `id: 4` and `title: 'HR/Policies/Leave_Policy.docx'` is duplicated (1:27:51 PM).
    *   This duplicate file is corrected at `1:28:08 PM` by changing its `id` to `6` and `title` to `HR/Policies/Leave_Policy2.docx`, ensuring unique identification and distinct content for the mock data.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **~11:30 AM - 11:47 AM:** Initial development and styling of `FileGirdItem` and `FileGirdItem2` components (SCSS files) and the introduction of `FilesGirdItem2.tsx` component logic. This period establishes the basic visual and interactive structure for individual file and folder items.
*   **~11:49 AM - 12:21 PM:** The `FileManagerGrid.tsx` component transitions from being entirely commented out to being fully active. This marks a major reintegration or completion of the file management grid functionality.
*   **~12:25 PM:** Introduction of custom SVG icon `UpOutlined.tsx`, indicating a shift to custom assets for some UI elements.
*   **~12:33 PM - 12:34 PM:** Refinement of the `TreeRow` component within `FileManagerGrid.tsx`, particularly adding an "Action" block to root folders.
*   **~12:36 PM - 1:01 PM:** Intensive iterative adjustments to spacing (`gap`, `margin`, `padding`) in `fileManagerGrid.scss`, suggesting a design review and pixel-perfecting phase.
*   **~1:27 PM - 1:28 PM:** Correction of duplicate mock data within the `Files.tsx` component, indicating testing and data integrity checks.
*   **~2:23 PM - 2:26 PM:** Color adjustments in `FileGirdItem.scss` and `fileManagerGrid.scss` for text labels, indicating a final pass on visual styling and readability.

### Patterns/Recurring Elements:

1.  **Iterative Styling Adjustments:** There's a strong pattern of frequent, small adjustments to CSS properties like `gap`, `margin-bottom`, and `padding` across multiple SCSS files (`FileGirdItem2.scss`, `FileGirdItem.scss`, `fileManagerGrid.scss`, `files.scss`). This suggests an iterative design process, possibly with live reloading, to fine-tune layout and spacing.
2.  **Commenting/Uncommenting Code:** Both SCSS files (`FileGirdItem2.scss`, `FileGirdItem.scss`, `fileManagerGrid.scss`) and TypeScript files (`FileManagerGrid.tsx`) show instances of code being commented out and then uncommented or modified. This could be for temporary disabling of features, testing different implementations, or a staged release of functionality. The large initial comment block in `FileManagerGrid.tsx` and `fileManagerGrid.scss` is a prime example of this.
3.  **Ant Design Integration:** The use of `antd` components like `Checkbox`, `Input`, `Button`, `Select`, `Pagination`, `message`, `Dropdown`, and `Divider` is consistent across the `.tsx` files, indicating a reliance on Ant Design for UI elements.
4.  **Custom Icon Usage:** The replacement of `@ant-design/icons` with custom SVG components (e.g., `UpOutlined.tsx`, `DownOutlined`) points to a pattern of using custom assets for specific visual needs, potentially for branding or specific design requirements.
5.  **File/Folder Structure:** The application seems to be building a file manager with both flat file listings and a hierarchical folder/file tree structure, as evidenced by `FilesGridItem`, `FilesGridItem2`, `FileManagerGrid`, and the `treeData`/`rootFiles` logic.
6.  **Action Buttons & Modals:** Common actions like download, delete, and edit are consistently implemented with dedicated buttons and managed through a `DeleteModal` component and a generic `handleModal` function.
7.  **Data Management:** State management for files (`files`, `selectedIds`, `expandedFolders`) and basic operations (search, sort, pagination, delete) are handled within the `Files` and `FileManagerGrid` components using `useState` and `useMemo`.
