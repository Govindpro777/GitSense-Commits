# Activity Summary for 1/31/2026

## 11:23:45 AM
In `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\WEB\SALES_ERP\swagger.js`, at `1/30/2026, 10:40:20 PM`, the Swagger API documentation configuration was updated. The primary changes involve transitioning the API host from a local development environment (`localhost:5000`) to a production deployment on `erp-sales-backend.onrender.com`. Correspondingly, the API scheme was switched from `http` to `https`, indicating a move towards secure communication for the deployed backend. The API is titled 'SalesERP API' with a description 'Sales ERP Management System API', and `swagger-autogen` is configured to generate `swagger-output.json` using `server.js` as the endpoint source.

## 1:54:44 PM
In `swagger.js`, at 1/30/2026, 10:40:20 PM, the configuration for `swagger-autogen` was updated. The primary changes involve shifting the API documentation host from a local development environment (`localhost:5000`) to a deployed environment (`erp-sales-backend.onrender.com`). Concurrently, the API scheme was updated from `http` to `https`, indicating a move towards secure communication typical for production or staging deployments. The API is titled 'SalesERP API' with the description 'Sales ERP Management System API', and it generates `swagger-output.json` by scanning `server.js` for endpoints.

## 2:54:23 PM
The `swagger.js` file underwent an update on 1/30/2026, 10:40:20 PM. This file is responsible for configuring Swagger API documentation generation for the 'SalesERP API'.

The key changes involve:
*   **Host update:** The API host was switched from `localhost:5000` to `erp-sales-backend.onrender.com`, indicating a deployment to a remote server.
*   **Scheme update:** The communication scheme was updated from `http` to `https`, enforcing secure connections for the API.
*   The Swagger documentation continues to use `server.js` as its endpoint source and outputs to `swagger-output.json`.

## 2:54:27 PM
The changes log details modifications primarily related to code formatting, linting, and project dependencies, all occurring on January 31, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.prettierrc.json`**:
    *   Initial configuration at **1/31/2026, 12:01:30 PM** set `singleQuote` to `true`.
    *   A significant change occurred at **1/31/2026, 2:40:57 PM**, modifying `singleQuote` from `true` to `false`.
    *   A subsequent update at **1/31/2026, 2:41:28 PM** maintained `singleQuote: false` without further functional changes to the file.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.eslintrc.json`**:
    *   Initially configured at **1/31/2026, 12:05:37 PM**, extending `airbnb` and `prettier`, with specific `settings` for `react` and `import/resolver`, and rules like `prettier/prettier: "error"`, `no-console: "off"`, `no-unused-vars: "warn"`, `func-names: "off"`, and `class-methods-use-this: "off"`.
    *   Shortly after at **1/31/2026, 12:05:53 PM**, the `settings` block was removed. New rules `no-process-exit: "off"` and `object-shorthand: "off"` were added.
    *   A later modification at **1/31/2026, 12:58:16 PM** commented out the `prettier/prettier: "error"` rule, effectively disabling it.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\package.json`**:
    *   First recorded change at **1/31/2026, 2:47:35 PM** showed `react` dependency as `^17.0.2`. It also listed various ESLint and Prettier related development dependencies (`eslint-config-prettier` `^10.1.8`, `eslint-plugin-prettier` `^5.5.5`, `prettier` `^3.8.1`).
    *   A subsequent update at **1/31/2026, 2:50:11 PM** changed the `react` dependency from `^17.0.2` to `^18.3.1`, while `react-dom` remained at `^17.0.2`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes occurred on the same day, **January 31, 2026**, indicating a focused session of configuration and dependency management.
*   A strong recurring theme is the configuration and fine-tuning of code quality tools, specifically **Prettier** and **ESLint**. This includes setting up their respective configuration files (`.prettierrc.json`, `.eslintrc.json`), installing their dependencies, and defining/modifying rules.
*   There's a pattern of disabling or loosening certain ESLint rules, such as `no-console`, `func-names`, `class-methods-use-this`, `no-process-exit`, and `object-shorthand`. The `prettier/prettier` rule was initially set as an error but later commented out.
*   Dependency management, particularly for `react`, is also a key pattern, showing an upgrade from version 17 to 18 in `package.json`.
