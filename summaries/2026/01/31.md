# Activity Summary for 1/31/2026

## 11:23:45 AM
In `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\WEB\SALES_ERP\swagger.js`, at `1/30/2026, 10:40:20 PM`, the Swagger API documentation configuration was updated. The primary changes involve transitioning the API host from a local development environment (`localhost:5000`) to a production deployment on `erp-sales-backend.onrender.com`. Correspondingly, the API scheme was switched from `http` to `https`, indicating a move towards secure communication for the deployed backend. The API is titled 'SalesERP API' with a description 'Sales ERP Management System API', and `swagger-autogen` is configured to generate `swagger-output.json` using `server.js` as the endpoint source.
