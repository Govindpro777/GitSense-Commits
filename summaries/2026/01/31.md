# Activity Summary for 1/31/2026

## 11:23:45 AM
In `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\WEB\SALES_ERP\swagger.js`, at `1/30/2026, 10:40:20 PM`, the Swagger API documentation configuration was updated. The primary changes involve transitioning the API host from a local development environment (`localhost:5000`) to a production deployment on `erp-sales-backend.onrender.com`. Correspondingly, the API scheme was switched from `http` to `https`, indicating a move towards secure communication for the deployed backend. The API is titled 'SalesERP API' with a description 'Sales ERP Management System API', and `swagger-autogen` is configured to generate `swagger-output.json` using `server.js` as the endpoint source.

## 1:54:44 PM
In `swagger.js`, at 1/30/2026, 10:40:20 PM, the configuration for `swagger-autogen` was updated. The primary changes involve shifting the API documentation host from a local development environment (`localhost:5000`) to a deployed environment (`erp-sales-backend.onrender.com`). Concurrently, the API scheme was updated from `http` to `https`, indicating a move towards secure communication typical for production or staging deployments. The API is titled 'SalesERP API' with the description 'Sales ERP Management System API', and it generates `swagger-output.json` by scanning `server.js` for endpoints.

## 2:54:23 PM
The `swagger.js` file underwent an update on 1/30/2026, 10:40:20 PM. This file is responsible for configuring Swagger API documentation generation for the 'SalesERP API'.

The key changes involve:
*   **Host update:** The API host was switched from `localhost:5000` to `erp-sales-backend.onrender.com`, indicating a deployment to a remote server.
*   **Scheme update:** The communication scheme was updated from `http` to `https`, enforcing secure connections for the API.
*   The Swagger documentation continues to use `server.js` as its endpoint source and outputs to `swagger-output.json`.

## 2:54:27 PM
The changes log details modifications primarily related to code formatting, linting, and project dependencies, all occurring on January 31, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.prettierrc.json`**:
    *   Initial configuration at **1/31/2026, 12:01:30 PM** set `singleQuote` to `true`.
    *   A significant change occurred at **1/31/2026, 2:40:57 PM**, modifying `singleQuote` from `true` to `false`.
    *   A subsequent update at **1/31/2026, 2:41:28 PM** maintained `singleQuote: false` without further functional changes to the file.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.eslintrc.json`**:
    *   Initially configured at **1/31/2026, 12:05:37 PM**, extending `airbnb` and `prettier`, with specific `settings` for `react` and `import/resolver`, and rules like `prettier/prettier: "error"`, `no-console: "off"`, `no-unused-vars: "warn"`, `func-names: "off"`, and `class-methods-use-this: "off"`.
    *   Shortly after at **1/31/2026, 12:05:53 PM**, the `settings` block was removed. New rules `no-process-exit: "off"` and `object-shorthand: "off"` were added.
    *   A later modification at **1/31/2026, 12:58:16 PM** commented out the `prettier/prettier: "error"` rule, effectively disabling it.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\package.json`**:
    *   First recorded change at **1/31/2026, 2:47:35 PM** showed `react` dependency as `^17.0.2`. It also listed various ESLint and Prettier related development dependencies (`eslint-config-prettier` `^10.1.8`, `eslint-plugin-prettier` `^5.5.5`, `prettier` `^3.8.1`).
    *   A subsequent update at **1/31/2026, 2:50:11 PM** changed the `react` dependency from `^17.0.2` to `^18.3.1`, while `react-dom` remained at `^17.0.2`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes occurred on the same day, **January 31, 2026**, indicating a focused session of configuration and dependency management.
*   A strong recurring theme is the configuration and fine-tuning of code quality tools, specifically **Prettier** and **ESLint**. This includes setting up their respective configuration files (`.prettierrc.json`, `.eslintrc.json`), installing their dependencies, and defining/modifying rules.
*   There's a pattern of disabling or loosening certain ESLint rules, such as `no-console`, `func-names`, `class-methods-use-this`, `no-process-exit`, and `object-shorthand`. The `prettier/prettier` rule was initially set as an error but later commented out.
*   Dependency management, particularly for `react`, is also a key pattern, showing an upgrade from version 17 to 18 in `package.json`.

## 3:54:42 PM
The changes log for the `iris-new` project on January 31, 2026, indicates a focused period of development and configuration adjustments, primarily impacting code formatting, linting, dependency management, and application routing, alongside the introduction of new Redux state management for "Watch Automation" features.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`.prettierrc.json`**:
    *   Initially configured with `semi: true`, `singleQuote: true`, `trailingComma: "es5"`, `printWidth: 80`, `tabWidth: 2`, `endOfLine: "auto"` (12:01:30 PM).
    *   The `singleQuote` setting was updated from `true` to `false` at 2:40:57 PM and remained consistent thereafter.

*   **`.eslintrc.json`**:
    *   Started with `airbnb` and `prettier` extends, enabling the `prettier` plugin and setting specific rules like `no-console: "off"`, `no-unused-vars: "warn"`, `func-names: "off"`, `class-methods-use-this: "off"` (12:05:37 PM). It also included React and TypeScript import resolver settings.
    *   Shortly after (12:05:53 PM), the React and TypeScript import resolver `settings` block was removed, and new rules `no-process-exit: "off"` and `object-shorthand: "off"` were added.
    *   The `prettier/prettier: "error"` rule was commented out at 12:58:16 PM, then uncommented and `import/extensions: 0` was added at 3:09:42 PM, indicating fine-tuning of import resolution rules. A subsequent entry at 3:52:03 PM showed no functional changes.

*   **`package.json`**:
    *   Between 2:47:35 PM and 2:58:26 PM, there was an attempt to upgrade the `react` dependency from `^17.0.2` to `^18.3.1`. This upgrade was then reverted back to `^17.0.2`, although the `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` dependencies were updated to newer `^17.0.90` and `^17.0.26` versions respectively and remained.

*   **`src\App.tsx`**:
    *   Between 3:05:17 PM and 3:16:06 PM, this file saw multiple minor changes, primarily related to the import path for the `Login` component. It toggled between using single (`'./Pages/Login'`) and double (`"./Pages/Login"`) quotes, and also repeatedly added and removed the `.tsx` file extension in the import path (`"./Pages/Login.tsx"` vs. `"./Pages/Login"`).
    *   The core functionality, including the definition of numerous application routes wrapped in a `PrivateRoute` component (e.g., `/search`, `/watch`, `/patent`, `/hearing`, `/dashboard`), the `ToastContainer` setup, and a `useEffect` hook to manage user authentication and redirection, remained consistent across these minor formatting changes.

*   **`src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`**:
    *   From 3:22:35 PM to 3:47:25 PM, this component underwent several import reordering changes, but its functional code remained largely stable.
    *   It defines a "Hearing" component using Ant Design for UI (Tabs, Table, Select, Popconfirm, Button) and `styled-components` for custom styling. It manages state for TLA and Opposition hearings, fetching data based on the current URL.
    *   Key features include table columns for "Cause List Title", "Total count", "Profile", "Reports", "Files" (with PDF/Excel links), "Month", "Created", "Location", and "Actions" (Verify, Send Report, Add Rows). The "Verify" action includes a `Popconfirm` with conditional warning messages.

*   **`src\Pages\Watchautomation\WatchautomationSlice.ts`**:
    *   Introduced at 3:52:12 PM, this file defines a Redux Toolkit slice responsible for managing state and asynchronous operations related to various watch automation reports (e.g., TM Applied, TM Protect, Image Label, Image Text, Image Similarity, TM Protect New). It includes `createAsyncThunk` functions for fetching data and handling errors, along with a detailed `InitialStateType` structure to track loading states, success/error statuses, data, page counts, and filters for each report type.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Configuration Refinement**: There's a clear pattern of continuous refinement of Prettier and ESLint configurations, indicating an effort to standardize code style and quality. The frequent toggling or commenting of `prettier/prettier` suggests integration challenges or evolving preferences.
*   **Dependency Adjustments**: The `package.json` changes highlight an attempt to upgrade React, followed by a rollback, suggesting compatibility issues or a change in project direction, while keeping the type definitions updated.
*   **Minor Formatting/Path Tweaks**: Both `src\App.tsx` and `src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx` show multiple, very rapid commits involving only import statement reordering or minor path changes (like adding/removing `.tsx` extensions). This often points to automatic formatting being applied by an IDE or linter, or a developer experimenting with import resolution.
*   **Redux Toolkit Usage**: The `WatchautomationSlice.ts` file demonstrates the use of Redux Toolkit for state management, following a pattern seen in modern React applications for handling asynchronous data fetching and state updates.
*   **Ant Design and Styled-components**: The `Hearing.tsx` file showcases consistent use of Ant Design components for UI elements and `styled-components` for component styling, indicating these are core UI libraries for the project.
*   **Authentication Enforcement**: The `App.tsx` consistently enforces user authentication for most routes via a `PrivateRoute` component and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.
*   **Toast Notifications**: The use of `react-toastify` across different files (`App.tsx`, `Hearing.tsx`, `WatchautomationSlice.ts`) points to a standardized approach for providing user feedback and notifications.
