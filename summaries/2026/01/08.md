# Activity Summary for 1/8/2026

## 2:47:06 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\about.ts` was updated multiple times on January 8, 2026. This TypeScript file appears to store constant data related to an "About" section of a web application, specifically for media mentions and team member information.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **1/8/2026, 2:19:27 PM:** The file was initially committed or recorded with a comprehensive set of data. It includes numerous imports of `.webp` image assets from `public/assets/About/` for team members and `public/assets/MediaMensions/` for media logos. It defines an `ArrowProps` interface, `mediaTestimonialData` (an array of 11 objects detailing media coverage with links, publishers, and brief texts), and `teamData` (an array of 30 team members, each with a `tabkey` for categorization, `name`, `designation`, and an `img` reference). At this point, Lakshmi Seetharaman's designation was 'Customer Success Manager'.

*   **1/8/2026, 2:21:01 PM:** A minor but specific change was made within the `teamData` array. The designation for 'Lakshmi Seetharaman' was updated from 'Customer Success Manager' to 'Product Manager'. All other content, including imports, the `ArrowProps` interface, and `mediaTestimonialData`, remained identical to the previous version.

*   **1/8/2026, 2:23:06 PM:** No further changes were detected in the content of the file compared to the 2:21:01 PM version. This indicates either a save operation without code modification or an identical commit.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/8/2026, 2:19:27 PM:** Represents the initial state or a major update including a large dataset for media and team information.
*   **1/8/2026, 2:21:01 PM:** Marks a targeted update, specifically modifying a single team member's designation.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Image Assets:** The file extensively imports and uses `.webp` image formats for both team photos and media logos, located in `public/assets/`.
*   **Data Structure:** Both `mediaTestimonialData` and `teamData` are arrays of objects, each object containing structured information (e.g., `id`, `image`, `link`, `publisher`, `text` for media; `tabkey`, `name`, `designation`, `img` for team).
*   **Team Categorization:** Team members are categorized using a `tabkey` field, with common categories being 'leadership', 'engineering', 'SandM' (Sales and Marketing), 'admin', and 'design'.
*   **Image Placeholders/Defaults:** Several team members in the `teamData` array are assigned the `angsuman` image (`img: angsuman`), suggesting it might be used as a placeholder or a default image for new entries or those without specific individual images.
*   **Content Focus:** The data consistently revolves around promoting "MikeLegal," featuring company media mentions and detailing its team structure.
