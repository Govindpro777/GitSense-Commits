# Activity Summary for 1/8/2026

## 2:47:06 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\about.ts` was updated multiple times on January 8, 2026. This TypeScript file appears to store constant data related to an "About" section of a web application, specifically for media mentions and team member information.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **1/8/2026, 2:19:27 PM:** The file was initially committed or recorded with a comprehensive set of data. It includes numerous imports of `.webp` image assets from `public/assets/About/` for team members and `public/assets/MediaMensions/` for media logos. It defines an `ArrowProps` interface, `mediaTestimonialData` (an array of 11 objects detailing media coverage with links, publishers, and brief texts), and `teamData` (an array of 30 team members, each with a `tabkey` for categorization, `name`, `designation`, and an `img` reference). At this point, Lakshmi Seetharaman's designation was 'Customer Success Manager'.

*   **1/8/2026, 2:21:01 PM:** A minor but specific change was made within the `teamData` array. The designation for 'Lakshmi Seetharaman' was updated from 'Customer Success Manager' to 'Product Manager'. All other content, including imports, the `ArrowProps` interface, and `mediaTestimonialData`, remained identical to the previous version.

*   **1/8/2026, 2:23:06 PM:** No further changes were detected in the content of the file compared to the 2:21:01 PM version. This indicates either a save operation without code modification or an identical commit.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/8/2026, 2:19:27 PM:** Represents the initial state or a major update including a large dataset for media and team information.
*   **1/8/2026, 2:21:01 PM:** Marks a targeted update, specifically modifying a single team member's designation.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Image Assets:** The file extensively imports and uses `.webp` image formats for both team photos and media logos, located in `public/assets/`.
*   **Data Structure:** Both `mediaTestimonialData` and `teamData` are arrays of objects, each object containing structured information (e.g., `id`, `image`, `link`, `publisher`, `text` for media; `tabkey`, `name`, `designation`, `img` for team).
*   **Team Categorization:** Team members are categorized using a `tabkey` field, with common categories being 'leadership', 'engineering', 'SandM' (Sales and Marketing), 'admin', and 'design'.
*   **Image Placeholders/Defaults:** Several team members in the `teamData` array are assigned the `angsuman` image (`img: angsuman`), suggesting it might be used as a placeholder or a default image for new entries or those without specific individual images.
*   **Content Focus:** The data consistently revolves around promoting "MikeLegal," featuring company media mentions and detailing its team structure.

The changes log details development activity primarily across two components: a Task Drawer and a File Upload Grid, along with a related File Preview Modal, and an Expense Drawer. All changes were recorded on January 8, 2026.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\AllTasks\TaskDrawer\TaskDrawerNew.jsx`
*   **Timestamps:** 1/8/2026, 10:24:51 AM and 1/8/2026, 10:26:31 AM
*   **Summary:** This file defines the `TaskDrawerNew` React component, which serves as a comprehensive drawer for managing tasks (viewing, editing, creating). It integrates various Ant Design UI components (Drawer, DatePicker, Input, message) and custom components like `Editor`, `SelectComponent`, `ExpandableDatePicker`, `SelectRelatedTo`, `SelectAssignedTo`, `NewFileUploadGrid`, and `ConfirmationModal`. It utilizes custom hooks from `@case-track-mono/Utils` (e.g., `useTaskDrawerUtilsNew`, `trackWeb`, `EVENTS`) and Redux (`useSelector`) for state management and data handling. Task attributes such as name, description, due date, reminder, priority, status, and assignees are managed here. The `NewFileUploadGrid` component is used for handling associated files. No functional code changes were observed between the two logged versions of this file.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\NewFileUploadGrid.jsx`
*   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 1/8/2026, 10:36:28 AM to 1/8/2026, 12:03:41 PM
*   **Summary:** This file implements the `NewFileUploadGrid` React component, a versatile interface for managing uploaded files and folders. It allows users to upload, download, delete, and rename files/folders. It uses `axios` for backend API interactions, Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) to update file state across different modules (expenses, payments, timesheets, tasks), and various Ant Design components for UI feedback.
    *   **Key Development Focus:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around refining the **folder deletion logic**, particularly when the component is in "create" mode (where changes are managed locally before being persisted to the backend).
        *   **Initial attempts** to filter files for local folder deletion were inconsistent (e.g., `item?.title !== title`).
        *   **At 1/8/2026, 11:24:05 AM**, a bug was introduced where local folder deletion aggressively cleared *all* files.
        *   **A major improvement at 1/8/2026, 11:28:21 AM** implemented a more robust local folder deletion by collecting all full file paths within a folder and filtering them from the current file list.
        *   **Subsequent changes (11:31:29 AM - 11:46:54 AM)** showed an iterative process of debugging and refining this local deletion logic, sometimes reverting to less robust filtering (using `item?.title` directly) and experimenting with different matching strategies (e.g., `!titlesToDelete.has(item?.title) && !titlesToDelete.has(item?.fullTitle)`).
        *   **At 1/8/2026, 11:50:36 AM**, a more effective approach was implemented: filtering files whose `item.title` (assumed to be the full relative path) *starts with* the deleted folder's path.
        *   **Brief regression at 1/8/2026, 11:54:01 AM** mistakenly changed folder deletion to single-file deletion.
        *   **The `handleDelete` function** (for single files) was also clarified at 1/8/2026, 11:56:50 AM, to explicitly use `fullTitle` or `title` for filtering.
        *   **Cleanup at 1/8/2026, 12:03:41 PM** removed a duplicated conditional block in `handleDelete`.
    *   **Patterns:** This file demonstrates a pattern of iterative refinement and debugging, specifically for complex client-side data manipulation like folder deletion within a dynamic file grid.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\UI\NewFileUploadGrid\FilePreviewModal.jsx`
*   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 1/8/2026, 12:16:00 PM to 1/8/2026, 12:52:29 PM
*   **Summary:** This file provides the `FilePreviewModal` component, responsible for displaying previews of various file types (PDFs, images, Microsoft Office documents). It fetches the file content/URL from the backend.
    *   **Key Change:** At **1/8/2026, 12:18:40 PM**, the `onPassword` handler for protected PDF files was updated. The changes improved the user experience for password prompts, dynamically setting the prompt message (e.g., "Password is incorrect. Please try again:") and streamlining the handling of empty password submissions and modal closure. The previous version used a `while(true)` loop which was removed.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\Expense\AddNewExpenseDrawer\AddNewExpenseDrawer.jsx`
*   **Timestamp:** 1/8/2026, 12:42:55 PM
*   **Summary:** This file defines the `AddNewExpenseDrawer` component. It allows users to add expenses either manually (via forms) or through bulk uploads using an Excel file. It manages form data, handles file input (accepting specific Excel types, converting to Base64), and provides functionality to download a sample Excel template for bulk uploads. It uses a custom hook `useAddNewExpenseUtils` and displays `BulkErrors` if present.

### Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:
*   **Technology Stack:** The codebase consistently uses React with functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`), Ant Design for UI elements and feedback (`message`, `Drawer`, `Modal`, `Spin`), and Redux for application-wide state management (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`).
*   **API Interaction:** All components requiring data interaction rely on `axios` for HTTP requests to a `ROOT_URL` (from `@case-track-mono/Configs`), consistently including an `Authorization` header with a bearer token for authentication.
*   **Utility Hooks and Event Tracking:** There's widespread use of custom utility hooks and functions imported from `@case-track-mono/Utils` (e.g., `trackWeb` for analytics events, `getValidAccessToken`, custom form/upload utilities).
*   **User Feedback:** Ant Design's `message` component is frequently used to provide success, error, and informational feedback to the user after various operations.
*   **Modals and Drawers:** `Drawer` components are used for complex forms and detailed views, while `Modal` components handle confirmations and previews, indicating a consistent UI/UX pattern.
*   **File Management Complexity:** The iterative changes in `NewFileUploadGrid.jsx` highlight the complexity and active development around robust file and folder management within the application, particularly handling local state changes efficiently.
