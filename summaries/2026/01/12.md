# Activity Summary for 1/12/2026

## 2:54:32 PM
This log primarily details front-end development activity within the `MikeCLM` application, focusing on contract management and file handling features, all occurring on **January 11-12, 2026**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\LinkedAgreements\LinkedAgreements.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/11/2026, 5:38:30 PM - 5:38:41 PM**
    *   This component manages linked agreements for a given document. It utilizes React hooks for state management (search, filters, pagination, selection) and Ant Design for UI elements. GraphQL queries (`GET_LINKED_AGREEMENTS`) and mutations (`BULK_UNLINK_AGREEMENTS`) are used to interact with the backend. Key functionalities include applying search/filters, handling bulk download with a slight delay between files, and confirming bulk unlink operations. Filter options are hardcoded for link type, execution status, and agreement status.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\ContractOverview\InfoSection.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 1/11/2026, 5:38:54 PM - 1/11/2026, 8:25:15 PM**
    *   This component displays various information tabs (Terms, DocChat, Signature, Linked Agreements) related to a contract.
    *   Early changes primarily show minor modifications and re-saves, ensuring correct tab switching logic for external signatories and linked documents.
    *   A recurring pattern of "LinkedAgreements" tab duplication is observed around **5:49 PM**.
    *   A significant change at **8:08:17 PM** introduces a new "Files" tab, indicating a new feature for managing associated files.
    *   Subsequent commits, particularly from **8:08:58 PM** to **8:16:33 PM**, show the "Files" tab being added, temporarily removed, re-added with placeholder content (`<div> gefg </div>`, `hi`), and undergoing further inconsistencies like the duplication of the "Terms" tab.
    *   By **8:25:15 PM**, the "Files" tab is solidified with a placeholder message "Files tab working ✅", confirming its intended presence and active development.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\package.json`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/11/2026, 5:57:30 PM**
    *   Updates several project dependencies, notably `react-router-dom` to `^7.1.3` (which is an unusual version, possibly an alpha or custom fork), `antd` to `^5.23.2`, `@apollo/client` to `^3.12.7`, and `@reduxjs/toolkit` to `^2.5.0`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json`**
    *   **Timestamps: 1/11/2026, 5:59:14 PM - 1/11/2026, 8:11:51 PM**
    *   These changes reflect developer's local VS Code settings. The main observable change is the commenting out of `"files.autoSave": "off"` at **8:11:51 PM**. Other settings include `editor.defaultFormatter` (Prettier), `editor.formatOnSave`, and `github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 1/11/2026, 10:45:10 PM - 1/12/2026, 1:55:53 PM**
    *   This file undergoes substantial and frequent changes, indicating active development.
    *   Initially introduced with mock data for files and basic search, sort, pagination, and bulk actions (download, delete).
    *   At **1/11/2026, 11:01:07 PM**, `FilesGridItem` (a sub-component) is temporarily defined inline within `Files.tsx` before being properly imported as a separate module.
    *   A major refactor at **1/11/2026, 11:11:24 PM** streamlines the component, removing some Ant Design imports and external hooks, and simplifying the file listing.
    *   From **1/12/2026, 10:09:55 AM**, functionality is progressively reintroduced, including `useNavigate`, `dayjs`, sorting, and a revamped search/filter UI (initially using a `.linked-agreements-filters` class, later `.files-search`).
    *   Significant additions for file uploading functionality are introduced at **1:20:43 PM**, including `fileRef`, `dirRef`, `uploadMenu` (with "File Upload" and "Folder Upload" options), and new asset imports for `FileUploadIcon`, `FolderUploadIcon`, and `UploadFilled`. References to `isOnline`, `isAllowed`, and `loaderType` appear, implying integration with a broader application state/context.
    *   Later changes around **1:47 PM - 1:55 PM** focus on refining the upload button's icon imports and styling, eventually using `UploadFilled` and removing the `type="primary"` prop from the button.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesGridItem.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 1/11/2026, 11:00:49 PM - 1/12/2026, 1:19:23 PM**
    *   This component represents an individual file or folder item in the file grid.
    *   Initially introduced with basic display of file details, checkbox selection, and a dropdown for actions (download, rename, delete) at **11:00:49 PM**.
    *   A structural simplification occurs at **11:10:53 PM**, flattening the JSX and changing the internal interface from `File` to `FileItem`.
    *   A major overhaul at **1/12/2026, 1:15:51 PM** transforms it into a more sophisticated `FileNode` interface, supporting both files and folders, dynamic icon rendering based on file type, a `formatSize` helper, and a redesigned layout with distinct sections for checkbox, icon/name, metadata (date of upload, uploaded by), and actions (with tooltips and responsive mobile menu). It also gains `onNavigate` and `onRename` props.
    *   However, a subsequent commit at **1:19:23 PM** appears to *revert* this component back to a simpler, older structure (similar to its state at 11:00:49 PM), losing the `FileNode` complexity and redesigned layout.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\assets\folderUpload\FileUploadIcon.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/12/2026, 1:43:55 PM**
    *   New file: Defines and exports a React component `FileUploadIcon` which renders a specific SVG for file uploads.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\assets\folderUpload\UploadFilled.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 1/12/2026, 1:52:30 PM - 1/12/2026, 1:55:16 PM**
    *   New file: Defines and exports a React component `UploadFilled` which renders a filled SVG upload icon. Initial versions accept `size` and `fill` props, but these are removed by **1:55:16 PM**, with the SVG `fill` color hardcoded to blue (`#0066FF`).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\files.scss`**
    *   **Timestamps: 1/12/2026, 10:14:37 AM - 1/12/2026, 2:21:45 PM**
    *   This SCSS file provides styling for the `Files` component.
    *   Initial styling for the grid layout, search, toolbar, and individual items is introduced around **10:14 AM**.
    *   Minor structural adjustments (e.g., to `.files-toolbar`, introduction of `.files-action`) occur throughout the morning.
    *   A significant styling overhaul is attempted at **1:16:44 PM**, with the previous CSS entirely commented out and a new, more elaborate design introduced, consistent with the `FileNode` interface and the advanced `FilesGridItem` design. This includes responsive media queries.
    *   However, this comprehensive stylesheet is then mostly commented out or reverted in subsequent commits (**1:19 PM - 2:21 PM**), restoring earlier, simpler grid item styles. The only new addition that persists is the `.upload-menu-item` style for the file upload dropdown.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Ant Design and React:** Extensive use of Ant Design components and standard React hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) is a consistent pattern across the `LinkedAgreements` and `Files` components.
*   **State Management:** Both major components (`LinkedAgreements`, `Files`) implement similar state management patterns for search text (local vs. applied), selected items, pagination, and sorting.
*   **Bulk Actions:** The ability to select multiple items and perform actions (download, delete/unlink) is a shared feature.
*   **Conditional UI:** Tabs and elements are frequently rendered based on user permissions or application state (e.g., `isLinked`, `clmPermissions`).
*   **Development Volatility in Files Feature:** The `Files` component, its grid item (`FilesGridItem.tsx`), and its associated styling (`files.scss`) show significant volatility. Multiple re-introductions, major overhauls followed by apparent rollbacks or partial reverts within a short timeframe indicate an active, iterative, and somewhat inconsistent development process for this feature. There's a clear disconnect between the advanced `FilesGridItem.tsx` overhaul at 1:15 PM and the stylesheet's subsequent reversion.
*   **SVG Icons:** New custom SVG icon components (`FileUploadIcon`, `UploadFilled`) are introduced to replace or supplement Ant Design icons, suggesting a move towards more custom branding or specific icon designs.
*   **Console Debugging:** Presence of `console.log` statements throughout the code indicates active debugging during development.
