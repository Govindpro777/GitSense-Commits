# Activity Summary for 1/16/2026

## 3:16:53 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`, last modified on `1/16/2026, 3:08:21 PM`, is a React functional component named `Files` designed to manage and display files within a contract management system.

**Key Updates and Features:**

*   **File Management UI:** The component provides a comprehensive user interface for listing, searching, filtering, and performing actions on files.
*   **State Management:** It utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`) to manage various UI states, including `searchText` for filtering, `selectedIds` for batch operations, `currentPage` for pagination, and `sortOrder` for file arrangement.
*   **File Data:** An initial set of mock file data (`files`) is provided, including details like title, creator, modification date, and size, with paths suggesting a hierarchical folder structure (e.g., `Legal/Agreements/2026/Dr. Shyam Prasad Agreement.xls`).
*   **Search and Filter:** Users can search files by document name using an Ant Design `Input` component, with the filtering logic optimized by `useMemo`.
*   **Sorting:** Files can be sorted by 'Latest' or 'Oldest' modification dates using a `Select` component.
*   **Pagination:** The component implements pagination with a `pageSize` of 20, displaying the total count of filtered files.
*   **Batch Actions:** Users can select multiple files to perform batch "Download" or "Delete" operations, with Ant Design `Badge` components indicating the number of selected files.
*   **File Upload:** A `Dropdown` menu offers "File Upload" and "Folder Upload" options, featuring custom icons (`FileUploadIcon`, `FolderUploadIcon`, `UploadFilled`). This upload mechanism is available both in the header and when no files are present.
*   **Empty State Handling:** If no files are found (either initially or after filtering), an empty state message with a `NoFilesIcon` and an upload option is displayed.
*   **Ant Design Integration:** The component heavily leverages Ant Design components for its UI elements, ensuring a consistent and modern look and feel.
*   **Custom Icons:** Several custom SVG icons (`DownOutlined`, `FileUploadIcon`, `FolderUploadIcon`, `UploadFilled`, `NoFilesIcon`) are imported and used throughout the component.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Ant Design heavy usage:** There's a consistent reliance on Ant Design components for almost all UI elements (buttons, inputs, selects, messages, dropdowns, pagination).
*   **Mock data:** The `files` array is initialized with mock data, suggesting that this component is either under development or awaiting integration with a backend API. The dates in the mock data extend to 2026, which is noteworthy given the log timestamp.
*   **Consistent Upload Entry Points:** The "Upload" `Dropdown` is present in two key locations: the main header and within the empty state, providing a clear path for users to add files regardless of the current state.
*   **Component-based Structure:** It imports `FileManagerGrid`, indicating a modular design where the file display logic is encapsulated in a separate component.
*   **Redundant Pagination:** There are two `Pagination` components rendered at the bottom of the container, one conditional on `totalCount > pageSize` and another always present. This might be an oversight or a temporary development state.
