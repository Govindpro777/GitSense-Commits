# Activity Summary for 1/27/2026

## 3:08:43 PM
The log details changes within an `iris-new` project, likely a React application. The activity is concentrated on January 25, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\tsconfig.json` (Timestamp: 1/25/2026, 4:42:53 PM):**
    *   Initializes or updates the TypeScript compiler options. Key configurations include targeting `es5`, supporting `dom`, `dom.iterable`, `esnext` libraries, enabling `allowJs`, `esModuleInterop`, `isolatedModules`, and `jsx` preservation. It specifies that only the `src` directory should be included for compilation.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\package.json` (Timestamp: 1/25/2026, 7:19:52 PM and 1/25/2026, 7:22:32 PM):**
    *   Defines a React project named "iris-web".
    *   **Dependencies:** Includes essential libraries like `react` (v17), `react-dom` (v17), `react-router-dom` (v6), `@reduxjs/toolkit` (v1.8.0), `antd` (v4.24.5), `axios`, `lodash`, `moment`, `styled-components`, `typescript`, `react-toastify`, and testing utilities (`@testing-library/*`).
    *   **DevDependencies:** Lists `eslint`, `prettier`, and several `eslint-plugin-*` packages for code linting and formatting.
    *   **Scripts:** Standard React scripts (`start`, `build`, `test`, `eject`).
    *   **Note:** The content of `package.json` remains identical across both log entries, suggesting no functional change, perhaps just a resave or a redundant log entry.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\package-lock.json` (Timestamp: 1/25/2026, 7:19:58 PM):**
    *   This entry reflects a dependency lock file for "iris-web" (version 0.1.0), indicating that `npm install` or `yarn install` was likely run around this time.
    *   It lists specific versions for a vast number of direct and transitive dependencies, including many `@babel/*` packages.
    *   **Note:** There's a slight discrepancy where `eslint-config-airbnb`, `eslint-config-node`, and `eslint-plugin-node` appear in `devDependencies` within `package-lock.json` but were not explicitly listed in the corresponding `package.json` entries provided.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx` (Timestamp: 1/25/2026, 7:40:18 PM, 7:41:59 PM, and 8:00:46 PM):**
    *   This is a significant React TypeScript component for managing "Hearings" (likely related to TLA - Trademark Legal Application or Opposition).
    *   It utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), `react-router-dom` for navigation, and `react-redux` for state management, interacting with `hearingSlice` and `app/store`.
    *   The component heavily uses Ant Design for its UI, including `Tabs` (for "unverified" and "verified" views), `Table` to display hearing data, `Select` for location updates, `Popconfirm` for verification prompts, and `Button` for actions.
    *   It defines various styled components (`FileStyle`, `StyledSteps`, `MyTable`) using `styled-components`.
    *   Key functionalities include:
        *   Fetching "TLA" and "Opposition" hearings based on the URL.
        *   Displaying detailed hearing information in a table, including cause list title (with a link to an admin interface), total counts, profile counts, report counts, and links to PDF/Excel files.
        *   Actions for "unverified" hearings: uploading files, adding rows (for opposition), and verifying entries (with checks for count mismatches or missing processed excel files).
        *   Actions for "verified" hearings: sending reports.
        *   Pagination handlers for both unverified and verified views.
        *   User authentication check on component mount.
    *   **Changes:** A minor refactoring occurred between 7:40:18 PM and 7:41:59 PM, where `const { Title } = Typography;` was moved from inside the `Hearing` component to the top-level file scope. The entry at 8:00:46 PM is identical to the previous one, showing no further changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Active Frontend Development:** The changes point to active development on a React application, focusing on UI (Ant Design), state management (Redux Toolkit), routing, and styling (`styled-components`).
*   **Timestamp Clustering:** All significant changes occurred on January 25, 2026, within a few hours (late afternoon to early evening), indicating focused development work during that period.
*   **Minor Iterations on Component:** The `Hearing.tsx` component saw rapid, minor updates (a refactoring followed by a resave without content change), suggesting an iterative development process or frequent saving.
*   **Comprehensive Setup:** The `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` indicate a well-structured modern TypeScript React project with robust linting and formatting tools.
*   **Data Management Focus:** The `Hearing.tsx` component is heavily centered on fetching, displaying, and acting upon structured data (`tla_journals`, `opposition_journals`), suggesting a data-intensive administrative interface.
*   **API Integration:** The component dispatches Redux thunks (`getTLAHearingsVerified`, `putLocation`, `sendReport`, etc.) which implies integration with a backend API. The admin links in the "Cause List Title" column also point to `miketmapi.mikelegal.com`.
