# Activity Summary for 2/25/2026

## 12:21:44 AM
For the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`, the primary significant change occurred around the transition from **2/24/2026, 11:58:46 PM** to **2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM**.

**File-Specific Updates:**
*   **`TotalTrademark.jsx`**: The component `TotalTrademark` is a React class component handling trademark management, including filtering, searching, and displaying trademark data.
    *   **Prior to 2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM**: In the `handleTrademarkProfile` method, when a trademark profile was accessed, both `management_trademark_id` and `application_number` were stored in `sessionStorage` and also set in the component's local state using `this.setState({ management_trademark_id: data.management_mark_id, application_number: data.application_number, });`.
    *   **From 2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM onwards**: The `handleTrademarkProfile` method was modified. While `management_trademark_id` and `trademark_application_number` continue to be stored in `sessionStorage`, the `application_number` is no longer explicitly set in the component's state via `this.setState`. The state update was simplified to `this.setState({ management_trademark_id: data.management_mark_id, });`. A new state variable `selectedAppNo: ""` was added in the constructor at this timestamp, but its usage is not evident in the provided `handleTrademarkProfile` snippet itself.
    *   All other timestamps for this file (2/24/2026, 11:56:19 PM, 2/24/2026, 11:58:14 PM, 2/25/2026, 12:05:06 AM, and subsequent entries up to 2/25/2026, 12:20:21 AM) show no further changes in the provided code snippets. The content remains identical to the version from 2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM**: This timestamp marks the introduction of a new state variable `selectedAppNo` and the alteration in `handleTrademarkProfile` to cease storing `application_number` directly in the component's state.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent File Modification**: All log entries point to the same file, `TotalTrademark.jsx`, indicating focused work on this specific component.
*   **Minor, Incremental Updates**: Many timestamps show identical code, suggesting frequent saves without functional changes, or very minor changes not captured in the diff provided beyond the single identified modification.
*   **State Management**: The component extensively uses local state (`this.state`) for managing various UI elements and filters, including `selectedFilters`, `searchFilters`, and flags like `changeSwitch` and `noTagToggle`.
*   **Redux Integration**: The component connects to Redux (`connect`) and dispatches actions like `getDashboard` and `getTrademark` to fetch data and manage the application's global state.
*   **Filter System**: There's a robust filtering system (`TM_DefaultSelectedFilters`, `TM_DefaultSearchFilters`, `filterKeys`, `applyFilter`, `resetFilter`) that supports both "ip_india" and "pseudo" trademark views, toggled by `changeSwitch`.
*   **Session Storage Usage**: `sessionStorage` is consistently used to persist `management_trademark_id` and `trademark_application_number` when navigating to a trademark or proprietor profile.
*   **Ant Design Components**: The component heavily relies on Ant Design components for its UI (e.g., `Row`, `Col`, `Table`, `Button`, `Input`, `message`, `Typography`, `Switch`, `notification`, `Tooltip`, `Layout`, `Spin`, `Badge`).

## 12:21:58 AM
The primary changes observed across the provided logs for the `clm-frontend` application, spanning the `AllContracts.tsx` container and `allContractsSlice.ts` Redux slice, revolve around the systematic deactivation and removal of filter persistence logic.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\AllContracts\AllContracts.tsx`**:
    *   **Filter Persistence Deactivation**: Numerous lines related to `allContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `allContractsIsFilterActive`, and `allContractsPersistedFilterValues` are commented out from Redux state selectors, `useEffect` dependency arrays, and the component's state management. This indicates a clear intention to stop using these specific persistence mechanisms within the component.
    *   **Initialization Logic Changes**: The initial `useEffect` responsible for loading persisted state from Redux (after `initializeAllContractsFromStorage` dispatch) saw significant commenting out of logic that previously applied `persistedFilterValues` to the component's `filterValues`.
    *   **Conditional Data Loading Modification**: The `hasPersistedState` check, which determined whether to load data with persisted filters or without, was progressively simplified by commenting out conditions related to `persistedIsFilterActive` and `persistedFilterValues` (timestamps 6:17:56 PM, 6:18:04 PM). Eventually, the entire conditional block for data loading (calling `refreshDocumentsWithFilters` or `getUserDocumentsFunc`) was commented out (timestamp 6:19:27 PM), indicating a significant work-in-progress state where data fetching on initialization might be temporarily halted or entirely refactored.
    *   **Filter Value Persistence Halt**: The explicit `dispatch(setAllContractsPersistedFilterValues(filterValues));` call within an `useEffect` was commented out (timestamp 6:19:46 PM), stopping the component from actively saving filter changes to the Redux store and by extension, localStorage.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\redux\AllContracts\allContractsSlice.ts`**:
    *   **Redux State and Reducer Removal**: In the only entry for this file (timestamp 6:26:19 PM), the `initialState` properties (`allContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `allContractsIsFilterActive`, `allContractsPersistedFilterValues`) and their corresponding reducers are commented out. This confirms a backend removal of these persistence states from the Redux store itself, aligning with the UI component changes.
    *   **Persistence Clearing and Initialization Updates**: The `clearAllContractsFilterPersistence` reducer's logic to remove these items from `localStorage` and `initializeAllContractsFromStorage` reducer's logic to load them were also commented out.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/24/2026, 5:54:56 PM**: Initial disabling of the logic to apply persisted filter values in `AllContracts.tsx`.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:11:03 PM to 6:11:53 PM**: A series of temporary and critical changes in `AllContracts.tsx` where several state variables (`isInitializing`, `isFilterActive`, `isResetting`) and a `useRef` (`initializationRef`) were commented out, causing potential functional breakage.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:15:21 PM to 6:17:19 PM**: Reversion of the problematic commenting-out from earlier, restoring `isInitializing`, `isResetting`, `isFilterActive`, and `initializationRef` in `AllContracts.tsx`.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:17:56 PM to 6:18:04 PM**: Modification of the `hasPersistedState` condition in `AllContracts.tsx`, effectively reducing its scope to primarily `persistedSearchQuery`.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:19:27 PM**: The entire data loading conditional block within `AllContracts.tsx` is commented out, a major functional change.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:19:46 PM**: The Redux dispatch for persisting filter values is commented out in `AllContracts.tsx`.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:26:19 PM**: Comprehensive removal/deactivation of filter persistence state and reducers in `allContractsSlice.ts`, solidifying the shift away from this persistence approach.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Systematic Removal of Filter Persistence**: The most prominent pattern is the consistent effort across both files to comment out or remove functionality related to `allContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `allContractsIsFilterActive`, and `allContractsPersistedFilterValues`. This indicates a deliberate strategic decision to change how filter state is managed or persisted.
2.  **Debugging `console.log` Cleanup**: Numerous `console.log` statements prefixed with `FILTER_DEBUG` are commented out throughout the `AllContracts.tsx` file, suggesting active debugging during the refactoring process, followed by removal of debugging output.
3.  **Iterative Refactoring with Revisions**: The sequence of commenting out and then re-enabling state variables and refs in `AllContracts.tsx` (e.g., `isInitializing`, `isFilterActive`, `initializationRef`) indicates an iterative and somewhat exploratory refactoring process, possibly with immediate corrections for introduced issues.

## 1:21:48 AM
The log shows a series of consistent updates across several React components related to trademark management and reporting functionalities, all occurring between **February 24, 2026, 11:56:19 PM and February 25, 2026, 1:21:25 AM**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**:
    *   This file was frequently updated throughout the specified period, with 12 entries.
    *   A significant and recurring change is the addition of `selectedAppNo: ""` to the component's `state` object. This suggests a new feature or refinement to track a selected application number. This was introduced at **2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM** and persisted across all subsequent commits for this file.
    *   The file manages the display and filtering of "Total Trademarks," distinguishing between "YOUR_TM," "OPPOSED_TM," and "STATUS_TRACKER" based on the URL.
    *   It handles various filter parameters like `trademarkClass`, `trademarkStatus`, `active_flag`, `inactive_flag`, `trademarkType`, etc., and includes logic for `applyFilter` and `resetFilter`.
    *   The `componentDidMount` lifecycle method includes logic to fetch dashboard data and trademark data, applying initial filters from URL parameters if present (`active`, `inactive`, `registered`).
    *   There's also logic to fetch filter keys (`PROPRIETOR`, `CLASSES`, etc.) for both "ip_india" and "pseudo" trademarks if the user has a "PSEUDO_TRADEMARK" subscription.
    *   `handleTrademarkProfile` and `handleProprietorProfile` functions are present for navigating to detailed profiles, storing IDs in `sessionStorage`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\report\Report.jsx`**:
    *   This file was updated twice around **2/25/2026, 12:39:31 AM**.
    *   It's responsible for displaying and managing various types of reports (custom, automated, TLA, opposition, international) for both trademarks and patents.
    *   The `componentDidMount` method makes multiple calls to `getProfileReport` for different report types and management types (trademark/patent).
    *   It features `downloadPDFReport`, `downloadEXCELReport`, and `downloadReport` functions for handling file downloads.
    *   A `handleEmail` function is defined to prepare and send emails with reports as attachments, dynamically setting `mailContent`, `subscription`, `source`, `sub_section`, and `report_tag` based on the report type and data. This function also calls `getEmailTemplateData`.
    *   The `columnsCustomReport` and `columnsDailyReport` definitions for an Ant Design `Table` are consistent across the two updates, defining columns for "Report Title," "File Name," "Date," "Download," and "Send Mail."

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\subComponents\trademarkProfileComponents\HearingTable.jsx`**:
    *   This file had one entry at **2/25/2026, 12:40:00 AM**.
    *   It displays a table of hearing data, with columns for "HEARING OFFICER," "HEARING LOCAT," "HEARING DATE," "HEARING TIME," and "ACTION."
    *   The "ACTION" column includes `CarryOutTwoTone` (for "Create To-do Task") and a paper-plane icon (for "Send email") with tooltips.
    *   It contains a `Switch` component to toggle between "As Per Cause List" and "IP India" data for hearings, managed by the `ipIdia` state.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\OpposedTrademark\TLA-Opposition.jsx`**:
    *   This file was updated three times between **2/25/2026, 12:40:50 AM and 12:43:31 AM**.
    *   It manages TLA (Trade-Legal Agreement) and Opposition hearings for opposed trademarks.
    *   The `handleEmail` function here constructs mail content and report tags specific to trademark hearings, including details like `journal_number`, `status`, `renewal_date`, `application_number`, `mark_name`, `proprietor_name`, `opponent_name`, and `hearing_date`. It also distinguishes between TLA and Opposition hearing dates in the report tag.
    *   A state variable `ipIdia` is checked within `handleEmail` for `object_id` determination, but this variable is not consistently updated or defined in the provided `TLA-Opposition` logs for its internal logic, suggesting a potential copy-paste error or an incomplete state management (as `this.state.ipIdia` is mentioned in the logic but not initialized for the `TLA-Opposition` component itself in the constructor, unlike `UpcomingHearings.jsx`).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TLA-Opposition.jsx`**:
    *   This file was updated once at **2/25/2026, 12:44:04 AM**.
    *   Similar to the OpposedTrademark version, it manages TLA and Opposition hearings, but specifically for "Your Trademark" context.
    *   It introduces `getTLAOppositionIP` action, indicating fetching data from "IP India" for TLA/Opposition hearings.
    *   The `ipIndiaButtonHandler` function explicitly toggles the `ipIdia` state and triggers data fetching based on its value. This is a key difference compared to `OpposedTLAOpposition.jsx`.
    *   The `handleNextpage` and `applyFilter` logic now explicitly checks `ipIdia` to decide whether to call `getTLAOpposition` or `getTLAOppositionIP`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\UpcomingHearings.jsx`**:
    *   This file was extensively updated (8 entries) between **2/25/2026, 12:48:38 AM and 1:21:25 AM**.
    *   This component manages "Upcoming Hearings" and includes complex filtering and pagination logic.
    *   It initializes `root` based on the URL, distinguishing "YOUR_TM" from "OPPOSED_TM".
    *   A new `selectedAppNo` state variable was introduced at **2/25/2026, 1:21:25 AM**, mirroring the update in `TotalTrademark.jsx`.
    *   It introduces `causeListHearings` and `ipIndiaHearings` actions, indicating distinct sources for hearing data.
    *   The `fetchFilters` and `onFilterSearch`/`onFilterPaginate` functions show sophisticated filter handling with debouncing and pagination for various filter types (Proprietor, Location, Officers, Tag, Client, Classes).
    *   The `componentDidMount` is updated to fetch filter data for multiple categories using `causeListHearings`.
    *   The `applyFilter` logic dynamically calls `causeListHearings` or `ipIndiaHearings` based on `isTla` and `subHearingType` (causeList/IP India).
    *   The `handleEmail` function constructs mail content and report tags with trademark-specific details, similar to `TLA-Opposition.jsx`, but uses `this.state.ipIdia` for `object_id` in `getEmailTemplateData`. This `ipIdia` state here seems to represent whether "IP India" data is active, and is distinct from the `isTla` state which toggles between TLA and Opposition.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Consistent File Renaming/Refactoring:** The multiple entries for `TotalTrademark.jsx`, `TLA-Opposition.jsx` (under `OpposedTrademark` and `YourTrademak`), and `UpcomingHearings.jsx` suggest iterative development, testing, or minor adjustments within the same feature sets. The filenames indicate a clear organization by trademark type (`YourTrademak`, `OpposedTrademark`) and functionality (Total, TLA-Opposition, Upcoming Hearings, Report).
2.  **Ant Design Components:** The widespread use of Ant Design components (`Row`, `Col`, `Table`, `Menu`, `Dropdown`, `Button`, `Input`, `message`, `Typography`, `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `notification`, `Tooltip`, `Layout`, `Spin`, `Badge`, `Card`, `Tabs`, `Radio`, `Alert`) indicates a consistent UI framework across the application.
3.  **Redux Integration:** All components utilize `connect` from `react-redux` and import various actions from `redux/actions/managerActions/` and `redux/actions/commonActions/`, showcasing a centralized state management pattern. Actions like `getDashboard`, `getTrademark`, `getProfileReport`, `getTLAOpposition`, `causeListHearings`, `ipIndiaHearings`, `getEmailTemplateData`, and `logOut` are repeatedly dispatched.
4.  **Filtering and Pagination:** A strong emphasis on data filtering and pagination is evident.
    *   Components maintain `selectedFilters` and `searchFilters` in their state, often differentiating between `ip_india`/`pseudo` or `opposition`/`tla`.
    *   `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters`, `TM_DefaultSearchFilters`, `Hearing_DefaultSelectedFilters`, `Hearing_DefaultSearchFilters`, and `Hearing_DefaultFilterConfig` constants are widely used for filter initialization.
    *   Functions like `applyFilter`, `resetFilter`, `handleNextpage`, `onFilterSearch`, and `onFilterPaginate` are common, indicating standardized approaches to data retrieval based on user input and navigation.
    *   Debouncing (`lodash.debounce`) is used for filter searches to optimize performance.
5.  **Modal Management:** Modals for "Create Task," "Download Report," "Manager Notes," and "Send Email" (specifically `SendEmailNew`) are common imports and state managed via `modalsVisibility` objects.
6.  **User Authentication/Session Management:** All `componentDidMount` methods start with a check for `localStorage.getItem("token")` and call `this.props.logOut()` if the token is missing, ensuring authenticated access. `sessionStorage` is also used to store `management_trademark_id` and `proprietor_id` for navigation.
7.  **Profile Navigation:** `handleTrademarkProfile` and `handleProprietorProfile` functions consistently set `sessionStorage` items and open new windows for detailed profile views, with conditional paths based on `this.state.root` (e.g., `OPPOSED_TM` vs. `YOUR_TM`).
8.  **Context-Specific Data Fetching:** Many `getTLAOpposition` and `getTrademark` calls include an `mmType` parameter (e.g., "trademark", "opposed", "tracker"), indicating that the same Redux actions are used for different trademark management contexts, controlled by the component's internal `root` or `mmType` state.
9.  **Email Functionality:** The `handleEmail` function is a repeated pattern across `Report.jsx`, `TLA-Opposition.jsx` (under OpposedTrademark), and `UpcomingHearings.jsx`, suggesting a common utility for sending emails related to various reports and hearing events. The `mailContent` and `report_tag` are dynamically generated based on the context.
10. **State Variable `ipIdia`:** This variable appears in `HearingTable.jsx`, `TLA-Opposition.jsx` (YourTrademak version), and `UpcomingHearings.jsx`. It likely controls the display and fetching of data specifically from "IP India" sources versus internal "Cause List" data. Its consistent presence and toggle functionality (e.g., `ipIndiaButtonHandler`) suggest a common feature for switching between data sources for hearings.
11. **New State Variable `selectedAppNo`**: This was introduced in `TotalTrademark.jsx` and `UpcomingHearings.jsx` at later timestamps, indicating a new requirement to track a specific application number within these components.
