# Activity Summary for 2/25/2026

## 12:21:44 AM
For the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`, the primary significant change occurred around the transition from **2/24/2026, 11:58:46 PM** to **2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM**.

**File-Specific Updates:**
*   **`TotalTrademark.jsx`**: The component `TotalTrademark` is a React class component handling trademark management, including filtering, searching, and displaying trademark data.
    *   **Prior to 2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM**: In the `handleTrademarkProfile` method, when a trademark profile was accessed, both `management_trademark_id` and `application_number` were stored in `sessionStorage` and also set in the component's local state using `this.setState({ management_trademark_id: data.management_mark_id, application_number: data.application_number, });`.
    *   **From 2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM onwards**: The `handleTrademarkProfile` method was modified. While `management_trademark_id` and `trademark_application_number` continue to be stored in `sessionStorage`, the `application_number` is no longer explicitly set in the component's state via `this.setState`. The state update was simplified to `this.setState({ management_trademark_id: data.management_mark_id, });`. A new state variable `selectedAppNo: ""` was added in the constructor at this timestamp, but its usage is not evident in the provided `handleTrademarkProfile` snippet itself.
    *   All other timestamps for this file (2/24/2026, 11:56:19 PM, 2/24/2026, 11:58:14 PM, 2/25/2026, 12:05:06 AM, and subsequent entries up to 2/25/2026, 12:20:21 AM) show no further changes in the provided code snippets. The content remains identical to the version from 2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM**: This timestamp marks the introduction of a new state variable `selectedAppNo` and the alteration in `handleTrademarkProfile` to cease storing `application_number` directly in the component's state.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent File Modification**: All log entries point to the same file, `TotalTrademark.jsx`, indicating focused work on this specific component.
*   **Minor, Incremental Updates**: Many timestamps show identical code, suggesting frequent saves without functional changes, or very minor changes not captured in the diff provided beyond the single identified modification.
*   **State Management**: The component extensively uses local state (`this.state`) for managing various UI elements and filters, including `selectedFilters`, `searchFilters`, and flags like `changeSwitch` and `noTagToggle`.
*   **Redux Integration**: The component connects to Redux (`connect`) and dispatches actions like `getDashboard` and `getTrademark` to fetch data and manage the application's global state.
*   **Filter System**: There's a robust filtering system (`TM_DefaultSelectedFilters`, `TM_DefaultSearchFilters`, `filterKeys`, `applyFilter`, `resetFilter`) that supports both "ip_india" and "pseudo" trademark views, toggled by `changeSwitch`.
*   **Session Storage Usage**: `sessionStorage` is consistently used to persist `management_trademark_id` and `trademark_application_number` when navigating to a trademark or proprietor profile.
*   **Ant Design Components**: The component heavily relies on Ant Design components for its UI (e.g., `Row`, `Col`, `Table`, `Button`, `Input`, `message`, `Typography`, `Switch`, `notification`, `Tooltip`, `Layout`, `Spin`, `Badge`).
