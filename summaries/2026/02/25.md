# Activity Summary for 2/25/2026

## 12:21:44 AM
For the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`, the primary significant change occurred around the transition from **2/24/2026, 11:58:46 PM** to **2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM**.

**File-Specific Updates:**
*   **`TotalTrademark.jsx`**: The component `TotalTrademark` is a React class component handling trademark management, including filtering, searching, and displaying trademark data.
    *   **Prior to 2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM**: In the `handleTrademarkProfile` method, when a trademark profile was accessed, both `management_trademark_id` and `application_number` were stored in `sessionStorage` and also set in the component's local state using `this.setState({ management_trademark_id: data.management_mark_id, application_number: data.application_number, });`.
    *   **From 2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM onwards**: The `handleTrademarkProfile` method was modified. While `management_trademark_id` and `trademark_application_number` continue to be stored in `sessionStorage`, the `application_number` is no longer explicitly set in the component's state via `this.setState`. The state update was simplified to `this.setState({ management_trademark_id: data.management_mark_id, });`. A new state variable `selectedAppNo: ""` was added in the constructor at this timestamp, but its usage is not evident in the provided `handleTrademarkProfile` snippet itself.
    *   All other timestamps for this file (2/24/2026, 11:56:19 PM, 2/24/2026, 11:58:14 PM, 2/25/2026, 12:05:06 AM, and subsequent entries up to 2/25/2026, 12:20:21 AM) show no further changes in the provided code snippets. The content remains identical to the version from 2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2/25/2026, 12:00:16 AM**: This timestamp marks the introduction of a new state variable `selectedAppNo` and the alteration in `handleTrademarkProfile` to cease storing `application_number` directly in the component's state.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent File Modification**: All log entries point to the same file, `TotalTrademark.jsx`, indicating focused work on this specific component.
*   **Minor, Incremental Updates**: Many timestamps show identical code, suggesting frequent saves without functional changes, or very minor changes not captured in the diff provided beyond the single identified modification.
*   **State Management**: The component extensively uses local state (`this.state`) for managing various UI elements and filters, including `selectedFilters`, `searchFilters`, and flags like `changeSwitch` and `noTagToggle`.
*   **Redux Integration**: The component connects to Redux (`connect`) and dispatches actions like `getDashboard` and `getTrademark` to fetch data and manage the application's global state.
*   **Filter System**: There's a robust filtering system (`TM_DefaultSelectedFilters`, `TM_DefaultSearchFilters`, `filterKeys`, `applyFilter`, `resetFilter`) that supports both "ip_india" and "pseudo" trademark views, toggled by `changeSwitch`.
*   **Session Storage Usage**: `sessionStorage` is consistently used to persist `management_trademark_id` and `trademark_application_number` when navigating to a trademark or proprietor profile.
*   **Ant Design Components**: The component heavily relies on Ant Design components for its UI (e.g., `Row`, `Col`, `Table`, `Button`, `Input`, `message`, `Typography`, `Switch`, `notification`, `Tooltip`, `Layout`, `Spin`, `Badge`).

## 12:21:58 AM
The primary changes observed across the provided logs for the `clm-frontend` application, spanning the `AllContracts.tsx` container and `allContractsSlice.ts` Redux slice, revolve around the systematic deactivation and removal of filter persistence logic.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\AllContracts\AllContracts.tsx`**:
    *   **Filter Persistence Deactivation**: Numerous lines related to `allContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `allContractsIsFilterActive`, and `allContractsPersistedFilterValues` are commented out from Redux state selectors, `useEffect` dependency arrays, and the component's state management. This indicates a clear intention to stop using these specific persistence mechanisms within the component.
    *   **Initialization Logic Changes**: The initial `useEffect` responsible for loading persisted state from Redux (after `initializeAllContractsFromStorage` dispatch) saw significant commenting out of logic that previously applied `persistedFilterValues` to the component's `filterValues`.
    *   **Conditional Data Loading Modification**: The `hasPersistedState` check, which determined whether to load data with persisted filters or without, was progressively simplified by commenting out conditions related to `persistedIsFilterActive` and `persistedFilterValues` (timestamps 6:17:56 PM, 6:18:04 PM). Eventually, the entire conditional block for data loading (calling `refreshDocumentsWithFilters` or `getUserDocumentsFunc`) was commented out (timestamp 6:19:27 PM), indicating a significant work-in-progress state where data fetching on initialization might be temporarily halted or entirely refactored.
    *   **Filter Value Persistence Halt**: The explicit `dispatch(setAllContractsPersistedFilterValues(filterValues));` call within an `useEffect` was commented out (timestamp 6:19:46 PM), stopping the component from actively saving filter changes to the Redux store and by extension, localStorage.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\redux\AllContracts\allContractsSlice.ts`**:
    *   **Redux State and Reducer Removal**: In the only entry for this file (timestamp 6:26:19 PM), the `initialState` properties (`allContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `allContractsIsFilterActive`, `allContractsPersistedFilterValues`) and their corresponding reducers are commented out. This confirms a backend removal of these persistence states from the Redux store itself, aligning with the UI component changes.
    *   **Persistence Clearing and Initialization Updates**: The `clearAllContractsFilterPersistence` reducer's logic to remove these items from `localStorage` and `initializeAllContractsFromStorage` reducer's logic to load them were also commented out.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/24/2026, 5:54:56 PM**: Initial disabling of the logic to apply persisted filter values in `AllContracts.tsx`.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:11:03 PM to 6:11:53 PM**: A series of temporary and critical changes in `AllContracts.tsx` where several state variables (`isInitializing`, `isFilterActive`, `isResetting`) and a `useRef` (`initializationRef`) were commented out, causing potential functional breakage.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:15:21 PM to 6:17:19 PM**: Reversion of the problematic commenting-out from earlier, restoring `isInitializing`, `isResetting`, `isFilterActive`, and `initializationRef` in `AllContracts.tsx`.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:17:56 PM to 6:18:04 PM**: Modification of the `hasPersistedState` condition in `AllContracts.tsx`, effectively reducing its scope to primarily `persistedSearchQuery`.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:19:27 PM**: The entire data loading conditional block within `AllContracts.tsx` is commented out, a major functional change.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:19:46 PM**: The Redux dispatch for persisting filter values is commented out in `AllContracts.tsx`.
*   **2/24/2026, 6:26:19 PM**: Comprehensive removal/deactivation of filter persistence state and reducers in `allContractsSlice.ts`, solidifying the shift away from this persistence approach.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Systematic Removal of Filter Persistence**: The most prominent pattern is the consistent effort across both files to comment out or remove functionality related to `allContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `allContractsIsFilterActive`, and `allContractsPersistedFilterValues`. This indicates a deliberate strategic decision to change how filter state is managed or persisted.
2.  **Debugging `console.log` Cleanup**: Numerous `console.log` statements prefixed with `FILTER_DEBUG` are commented out throughout the `AllContracts.tsx` file, suggesting active debugging during the refactoring process, followed by removal of debugging output.
3.  **Iterative Refactoring with Revisions**: The sequence of commenting out and then re-enabling state variables and refs in `AllContracts.tsx` (e.g., `isInitializing`, `isFilterActive`, `initializationRef`) indicates an iterative and somewhat exploratory refactoring process, possibly with immediate corrections for introduced issues.
