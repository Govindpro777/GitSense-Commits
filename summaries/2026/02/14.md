# Activity Summary for 2/14/2026

## 2:08:34 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the Trademark Dashboard functionality within the IPSuite-Web application, specifically regarding filter management and UI updates.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\managerActions\trademarkDashboard\actions.js`**
    *   Across multiple timestamps (2/13/2026, from 4:31:40 PM to 5:51:19 PM), this file consistently contains two active Redux actions: `getTmRenewals` and `renewalFiled`.
    *   A significant portion of the file, specifically the `getReplyToCorrespondence` function and its related logic (handling different `mmType` cases like 'trademark' and 'opposed'), remains entirely commented out throughout all logged changes. This suggests it's either an incomplete feature, temporarily disabled, or deprecated.
    *   No active code changes were observed in this file within the provided log.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\managerConstants\trademarkConstants.js`**
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:32:54 PM:** This file defined default selected filters for trademarks (`TM_DefaultSelectedFilters`) and hearings (`Hearing_DefaultSelectedFilters`), along with search filters and filter configurations. It initially included `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` as boolean flags in `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:39 PM:** The filter key `filter_active_status` within `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` was renamed to `active_flag`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM:** The filter key `filter_inactive_status` within `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` was renamed to `inactive_flag`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:34:18 PM:** The `TotalTrademark` React component was present, handling display and filtering logic for trademarks. Its `applyFilter` method used `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:34:36 PM:** The `applyFilter` function was updated to include `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` in its filter check condition, making these flags contribute to whether a filter is considered "applied".
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:15 PM:** The `applyFilter` function's destructuring was updated to use `active_flag` instead of `filter_active_status`, reflecting the change in `trademarkConstants.js`. A temporary syntax error (double `||`) was introduced in the filter check condition.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:22 PM:** The `applyFilter` function's destructuring was updated to use `inactive_flag` instead of `filter_inactive_status`. A typo (`filter_inactive_statu`) persisted in the filter check condition.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:22 PM:** The typo in the `applyFilter` condition was corrected to `inactive_flag`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\FilterComponents\FilterSearchBasic.jsx`**
    *   **2/13/2026, from 4:35:16 PM to 4:36:26 PM:** This entire `FilterSearchBasic` React component was commented out in the codebase, indicating it was temporarily disabled or undergoing major changes.
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:36:34 PM:** The entire file was uncommented, making the `FilterSearchBasic` component active again. A new section was added specifically for `filter_key === "trademarkStatus"`, introducing "Active" and "In-Active" checkboxes. The `isActive` and `isInactive` states were tied to `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` from `selectedFilters`. Deadlock protection logic was also added to prevent both checkboxes from being enabled/disabled simultaneously.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:44:50 PM:** The `isActive` variable definition was updated to read from `active_flag` (reflecting changes in `trademarkConstants.js`). A temporary bug was introduced in the `onChange` handler for the "Active" checkbox, where one `onSelect` call used an empty string as a key.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:44:57 PM:** The bug in the "Active" checkbox's `onChange` handler was partially fixed, using `active_flag` for the `switchValue` case.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:07 PM:** The `onChange` handler for the "Active" checkbox was fully corrected to consistently use `active_flag`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:49:50 PM:** The `isInactive` variable definition was updated to read from `inactive_flag`, aligning with the constant renaming.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:07 PM and 5:50:12 PM:** The `onChange` handler for the "In-Active" checkbox was updated in two steps to consistently use `inactive_flag` in both `onSelect` cases.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Filter Status Refactoring:** A prominent pattern is the refactoring of trademark status filters. The keys `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` were consistently renamed to `active_flag` and `inactive_flag` across the `trademarkConstants.js` constants file, the `TotalTrademark.jsx` component logic, and the `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` UI component. This indicates a system-wide effort to standardize filter names and implement corresponding UI controls.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The close timestamps for multiple changes in `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` and `TotalTrademark.jsx` (often within seconds or minutes) suggest rapid development, debugging, and saving cycles for implementing the new filter logic. This includes fixing syntax errors and ensuring consistent filter key usage across components.
*   **Modularity in Filtering:** The use of `FilterSearchBasic` as a common component indicates a modular approach to implementing filtering UI.
*   **Authentication and Error Handling:** Redux actions consistently implement token-based authentication (`localStorage.getItem("token")`) and centralized error handling (`checkAuthorisation(dispatch, err)`).
*   **Trademark-Specific Logic:** All changes are contained within the `trademarkDashboard` context, indicating focused development on trademark management features, including renewals, filtering, and UI components.
*   **Commented-out Code:** The consistently commented-out `getReplyToCorrespondence` function in `actions.js` and the temporary commenting out of the entire `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` component highlight code that is either under development, deprecated, or temporarily disabled.

## 3:08:28 PM
**File-Specific Updates:**

**1. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\managerActions\trademarkDashboard\actions.js`**
*   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:31:40 PM, 4:31:50 PM, 4:32:00 PM, 4:32:23 PM, 4:33:02 PM, 5:45:52 PM, 5:49:13 PM, 5:49:20 PM, 5:50:59 PM, 5:51:19 PM.
*   **Key Changes:** Across all logged entries for this file, the content remains functionally identical. It imports necessary libraries (Axios, Ant Design's `message`), root configurations, common constants (LOADING, ERROR, SUCCESS), and an extensive list of trademark-related action types. It defines Redux action creators `getTmRenewals` and `renewalFiled` for fetching and posting trademark renewal data, respectively. Both functions handle API calls with authorization and dispatch actions to indicate loading, success, or error states. Notably, a large function `getReplyToCorrespondence` is entirely commented out throughout all timestamps, suggesting it's either under development, intentionally disabled, or legacy code.

**2. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\managerConstants\trademarkConstants.js`**
*   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:32:54 PM, 5:45:39 PM, 5:50:42 PM.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **4:32:54 PM:** This version defines various default filter objects (`TM_DefaultSelectedFilters`, `TM_DefaultSearchFilters`, `TM_DefaultFilterConfig`, etc.) for trademark management. `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` includes `filter_active_status: false` and `filter_inactive_status: false`.
    *   **5:45:39 PM:** The `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` object is updated to rename `filter_active_status` to `active_flag`.
    *   **5:50:42 PM:** The `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` object is further updated to rename `filter_inactive_status` to `inactive_flag`.

**3. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**
*   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:34:18 PM, 4:34:36 PM, 5:45:15 PM, 5:50:22 PM, 5:50:30 PM.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **4:34:18 PM & 4:34:36 PM:** Initial state defines routing logic to determine `mmType` (trademark, opposed, tracker). It initializes `selectedFilters` and `searchFilters` using default values from `trademarkConstants.js`. The `applyFilter` logic checks for `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status`.
    *   **5:45:15 PM:** The `applyFilter` method is updated to check for `active_flag` instead of `filter_active_status`. A syntax error (`|| || filter_inactive_status`) is introduced in the filter condition.
    *   **5:50:22 PM:** The syntax error in `applyFilter` is corrected, and `filter_inactive_status` is updated to `inactive_flag` in the filter condition.
    *   **5:50:30 PM:** Content is identical to the 5:50:22 PM entry, indicating no further changes.

**4. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\FilterComponents\FilterSearchBasic.jsx`**
*   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:35:16 PM, 4:35:22 PM, 4:35:36 PM, 4:35:51 PM, 4:36:13 PM, 4:36:26 PM, 4:36:34 PM, 4:36:41 PM, 4:36:49 PM, 5:44:50 PM, 5:44:57 PM, 5:45:07 PM, 5:50:07 PM, 5:50:12 PM.
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **4:35:16 PM to 4:36:26 PM:** The entire component is commented out, suggesting it was temporarily disabled or undergoing a major overhaul.
    *   **4:36:34 PM:** The component is uncommented. A new feature is added: a conditional rendering block specifically for `filter_key === "trademarkStatus"`. This block introduces "Active" and "In-Active" checkboxes for status filtering, including logic to prevent both from being selected simultaneously (deadlock protection). The `onChange` for these checkboxes uses `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status`.
    *   **5:44:50 PM:** The `isActive` state derivation changes to use `active_flag`. The `onChange` handler for the "Active" checkbox is updated, introducing a potential bug by passing an empty string as the filter key under certain conditions.
    *   **5:44:57 PM:** The `onChange` handler for the "Active" checkbox is corrected to consistently use `"active_flag"` as the filter key.
    *   **5:49:50 PM:** The `isInactive` state derivation changes to use `inactive_flag`.
    *   **5:50:07 PM & 5:50:12 PM:** The `onChange` handler for the "In-Active" checkbox is updated to consistently use `"inactive_flag"` as the filter key.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Filter Status Key Renaming:** A prominent pattern is the renaming of filter keys related to "active" and "inactive" status. Initially, they were `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status`, which were then consistently refactored across `trademarkConstants.js`, `TotalTrademark.jsx`, and `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` to `active_flag` and `inactive_flag`. This suggests a system-wide update for consistency in filter terminology.
*   **Development Cycle:** The initial commenting out of `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` and the `getReplyToCorrespondence` function in `actions.js` suggests a development process where features might be temporarily disabled or are in an incomplete state.
*   **Ant Design Components:** The frequent import and usage of Ant Design components (`Menu`, `Typography`, `Input`, `Checkbox`, `message`, `Table`, `Button`, `Dropdown`, `Switch`, `notification`, `Tooltip`, `Layout`, `Spin`, `Badge`) indicates a strong reliance on Ant Design for UI/UX.
*   **Redux for State Management:** The project extensively uses Redux, with clear action types (LOADING, ERROR, SUCCESS) and action creators for managing asynchronous data flows.
*   **Authorization:** All API interactions consistently include an `Authorization` header with a token retrieved from `localStorage`, emphasizing security for API calls.
*   **Common Utility Functions:** Functions like `checkAuthorisation` and `checkValue` (from `commonFunctions`) are repeatedly used across files for validation and authorization, pointing to a shared utility layer.
*   **Repetitive Timestamps:** Several files show multiple timestamps with identical or very minor changes. This could indicate frequent saves during development, version control operations, or automated formatting.

## 4:08:33 PM
The changes primarily revolve around refactoring trademark status filter keys across multiple related files, along with some code activation and bug fixes. The timestamps indicate a rapid, iterative development process, often with errors being introduced and quickly corrected in subsequent saves.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\managerActions\trademarkDashboard\actions.js`**
    *   Across all recorded timestamps (from 2/13/2026, 4:31:40 PM to 5:51:19 PM), the content of this file remains functionally identical in the provided logs. It defines Redux actions `getTmRenewals` and `renewalFiled` for trademark management, making API calls with authorization. A significant portion of the `getReplyToCorrespondence` function remains commented out throughout all timestamps. No discernible changes in active code were made.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\managerConstants\trademarkConstants.js`**
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:32:54 PM:** This file initially defined default filters, including `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` with `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` set to `false`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:39 PM:** The key `filter_active_status` within `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` was renamed to `active_flag`. `filter_inactive_status` remained unchanged at this point.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM:** The key `filter_inactive_status` within `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` was also renamed, changing to `inactive_flag`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:34:18 PM & 4:34:36 PM:** The component's `resetFilter` and `applyFilter` methods used the `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` keys.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:15 PM:** The `applyFilter` function was updated to destructure `active_flag` instead of `filter_active_status`. A temporary syntax error (double `||` operator) was introduced in the `if` condition.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:22 PM:** The syntax error in `applyFilter` was corrected.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:22 PM:** The `applyFilter` function was further updated to destructure `inactive_flag` instead of `filter_inactive_status`. A new typo (`filter_inactive_statu`) was introduced in the `if` condition.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:30 PM:** The typo in `applyFilter` was corrected to `inactive_flag`.
    *   These changes reflect the refactoring of filter keys in `trademarkConstants.js`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\FilterComponents\FilterSearchBasic.jsx`**
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:35:16 PM to 4:36:26 PM:** The entire file content was commented out, suggesting it was temporarily disabled or under development.
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:36:34 PM:** The file was uncommented and activated. A new feature for "Active" and "In-Active" status checkboxes was added for `trademarkStatus` filtering, using `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` for state management and `onSelect` calls.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:44:50 PM:** The logic for determining `isActive` was updated to check for `active_flag`. A bug was introduced in the `onChange` handler for the "Active" checkbox, where `onSelect` was called with an empty string as the key in one case.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:44:57 PM:** The bug in the "Active" checkbox's `onChange` handler was corrected to consistently use `active_flag`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:07 PM:** The logic for determining `isInactive` was updated to check for `inactive_flag`. A bug was introduced in the `onChange` handler for the "In-Active" checkbox, where it referred to the old key (`filter_inactive_status`) in one case.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:12 PM:** The bug in the "In-Active" checkbox's `onChange` handler was corrected to consistently use `inactive_flag`.
    *   This component's changes also directly mirror the filter key refactoring, including the introduction and subsequent correction of implementation bugs related to the key changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Filter Key Refactoring:** The most prominent pattern is the renaming of `filter_active_status` to `active_flag` and `filter_inactive_status` to `inactive_flag` across the `trademarkConstants.js`, `TotalTrademark.jsx`, and `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` files. This suggests a concerted effort to standardize or clarify these filter keys.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Debugging:** Several timestamps show very short intervals between changes (seconds to minutes). This is particularly evident in `TotalTrademark.jsx` and `FilterSearchBasic.jsx`, where a change might introduce a bug (like a syntax error or an incorrect key reference), and a subsequent commit quickly fixes it.
*   **Commented-out Code:** The `getReplyToCorrespondence` function in `actions.js` remains commented out consistently, implying it's either a work in progress, a placeholder, or a feature intentionally disabled. `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` also underwent a period of being entirely commented out before becoming active with new functionality.
*   **Focus on Trademark Filtering:** All significant changes relate to trademark data management and filtering within the manager dashboard, specifically concerning active/inactive statuses and general filter application logic.

## 4:11:17 PM
The log details a significant update to the `UserManagement.jsx` file, timestamped `2/14/2026, 3:23:24 PM`.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\WEB\webseeder-erp-main\src\Pages\user-management\UserManagement.jsx`**

This file represents a React component designed for comprehensive user management within an ERP system. Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **User Management Features**: The component provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for user accounts. This includes adding new users, editing existing user details, deleting users, and toggling their active status.
*   **Module-Based Access Control**: A `MODULES` constant is defined, mapping various ERP functionalities (e.g., Account Master, Item Master, Sales, Purchase, Expenses, Receipts, Payments, Contra Entry, Journal Voucher) to unique IDs and labels. Users can be assigned specific access permissions to these modules, managed via checkboxes in the user form.
*   **State Management**: Extensive use of React's `useState` hook manages the list of users, search term, modal visibility, currently editing user, loading and submission states, and pagination (current page, items per page). `formData` specifically handles user input, including a nested `userModuleAccess` object for permissions.
*   **Data Fetching and API Interaction**:
    *   It utilizes `axios` for all API calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to an `API_BASE_URL` sourced from `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
    *   Authentication is handled by including a JWT `token` retrieved from `localStorage` in the request headers.
    *   `fetchUsers` is an asynchronous function called on component mount (`useEffect`) to retrieve user data.
*   **Branch-Specific User Filtering**: A crucial pattern is the `getBranchIdFromStorage` function, which fetches the `branchId` from the `localStorage`'s "user" object. `fetchUsers` then filters the fetched users to display only those belonging to the current user's branch, ensuring data segregation.
*   **Form Handling and Validation**: Functions like `handleInputChange`, `handleModuleToggle`, and `handleSubmit` manage user input. Basic client-side validation for required fields (name, email, phone, password for new users) is implemented before API submission.
*   **User Feedback**: `react-toastify` is integrated to provide real-time feedback to the user regarding ongoing operations (loading, success, error messages for user creation, update, deletion, and status toggling).
*   **Search and Pagination**: Users can search for specific users by name or email. The displayed user list is paginated (`itemsPerPage` set to 5), with calculated total pages and functions to navigate between pages.
*   **UI Elements**: The component imports various `lucide-react` icons (e.g., Users, Plus, Edit2, Trash2, Search, CheckCircle2, XCircle, Loader2, ChevronLeft, ChevronRight) to enhance the user interface, indicating actions and states. The structure implies a clean ERP-style layout with a distinct header.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:

*   **Consistent API Interaction**: All API calls follow a similar pattern: `axios` method, `API_BASE_URL` concatenation, payload, and `headers` including `Authorization: Bearer ${token}`.
*   **Centralized Error Handling**: `try...catch...finally` blocks are consistently used for API calls, with errors logged to the console and user-friendly toast messages displayed.
*   **Loading States**: `setLoading` and `setSubmitting` states are managed across asynchronous operations to provide visual feedback (e.g., loading spinners) to the user.
*   **Branch-specific Data Scoping**: The logic to filter users based on the `currentBranchId` extracted from `localStorage` is a core, recurring pattern for data access.
*   **Module-based Permissions**: The `MODULES` constant and its usage within `formData` for `userModuleAccess` show a consistent approach to defining and managing user permissions for different parts of the application.

## 11:45:41 PM
The code changes primarily occurred on 2/13/2026, with some continuation on 2/14/2026. A notable pattern is the iterative refinement and bug fixing related to trademark status filtering, specifically the handling of "active" and "inactive" statuses. Many changes are logged within seconds of each other, suggesting rapid development cycles, frequent saves, or automated processes.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\managerActions\trademarkDashboard\actions.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:31:40 PM - 5:51:19 PM (multiple entries, often seconds apart).
    *   **Updates:** This file defines Redux actions for trademark management. It includes actions like `getTmRenewals` (fetching renewals) and `renewalFiled` (posting renewal data). A significant `getReplyToCorrespondence` function, which supports various filters and "pseudo" marks, remains fully commented out across all logged changes for this file. The content of this file appears to be consistently the same throughout all log entries, indicating no functional changes were introduced or removed within these specific timestamps, but rather the file was saved multiple times.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\managerConstants\trademarkConstants.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:32:54 PM, 5:45:39 PM, 5:50:42 PM.
    *   **Updates:** The `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` constant was updated. Initially, it included `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status`.
        *   At **5:45:39 PM**, `filter_active_status` was renamed to `active_flag`.
        *   At **5:50:42 PM**, `filter_inactive_status` was renamed to `inactive_flag`.
    *   Other constants in this file (`TM_DefaultSearchFilters`, `TM_DefaultFilterConfig`, `Hearing_DefaultSelectedFilters`, etc.) remained unchanged in the provided logs.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:34:18 PM - 2/14/2026, 11:41:03 PM (multiple entries).
    *   **Updates:** This React component manages the display and filtering of total trademarks.
        *   The component's state and initialization logic largely remained consistent.
        *   The `applyFilter()` method saw significant iterative updates related to trademark status filtering.
            *   At **4:34:36 PM**, the `if` condition within `applyFilter` checked `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status`.
            *   By **5:45:15 PM**, the destructuring of `selectedFilters` within `applyFilter` started using `active_flag`, but the conditional `if` block still referenced `filter_inactive_status`.
            *   At **5:50:22 PM**, the `filter_inactive_inactive` was destructured as `inactive_flag`, but a typo `|| filter_inactive_statu` was present in the `if` condition.
            *   This typo was corrected to `|| inactive_flag` in subsequent updates, fixing the logic to correctly use `active_flag` and `inactive_flag` for filtering.
        *   Other methods like `componentDidMount`, `handleTrademarkProfile`, `handleProprietorProfile`, `downloadReport`, `resetFilter`, `handleNextpage`, `changeSwitch`, `handleManagerNotes`, and `handleEmail` maintained their structure and logic, primarily adapting to the renamed filter flags where necessary.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\FilterComponents\FilterSearchBasic.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:35:16 PM - 5:50:12 PM (multiple entries).
    *   **Updates:** This common filter component experienced several changes related to its state and how active/inactive filters are applied.
        *   Initially, at **4:35:16 PM**, the entire component was commented out.
        *   By **4:35:22 PM**, the component was uncommented and included logic for `getFilterValue`, `isActive`, and `isInactive`. It added a conditional rendering block for `filter_key === "trademarkStatus"` to display "Active" and "In-Active" checkboxes with mutual disabling logic.
        *   At **5:44:50 PM**, `isActive` started deriving its value from `active_flag`, but the `onChange` handler for the "Active" checkbox had a momentary bug, targeting an empty string `""`.
        *   This bug was fixed at **5:44:57 PM**, correctly targeting `active_flag`.
        *   At **5:49:50 PM**, `isInactive` started deriving its value from `inactive_flag`, but the "In-Active" checkbox's `onChange` handler still targeted the old `filter_inactive_status` key.
        *   This was corrected by **5:50:07 PM** and **5:50:12 PM** to consistently target `inactive_flag`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Trademark Status Filter Refactoring:** The most prominent pattern is the comprehensive refactoring of trademark status filtering. This involved renaming the keys (`filter_active_status` to `active_flag`, `filter_inactive_status` to `inactive_flag`) in `trademarkConstants.js` and subsequently updating their usage in both `TotalTrademark.jsx` (the consumer of these filters) and `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` (the UI component providing these filters).
*   **Rapid Iteration and Bug Fixes:** The close timestamps and quick corrections of minor bugs (like targeting empty strings or old filter keys) indicate an agile development process with frequent commits or saves.
*   **Redux and Ant Design Integration:** All files show a consistent architecture utilizing Redux for state management and Ant Design components for the user interface, particularly for complex filtering menus.
*   **Commented Code:** The `getReplyToCorrespondence` function in `actions.js` being consistently commented out suggests it's either under development, temporarily disabled, or an alternative approach is being used elsewhere.
