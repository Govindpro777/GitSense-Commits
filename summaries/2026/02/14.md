# Activity Summary for 2/14/2026

## 2:08:34 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the Trademark Dashboard functionality within the IPSuite-Web application, specifically regarding filter management and UI updates.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\managerActions\trademarkDashboard\actions.js`**
    *   Across multiple timestamps (2/13/2026, from 4:31:40 PM to 5:51:19 PM), this file consistently contains two active Redux actions: `getTmRenewals` and `renewalFiled`.
    *   A significant portion of the file, specifically the `getReplyToCorrespondence` function and its related logic (handling different `mmType` cases like 'trademark' and 'opposed'), remains entirely commented out throughout all logged changes. This suggests it's either an incomplete feature, temporarily disabled, or deprecated.
    *   No active code changes were observed in this file within the provided log.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\managerConstants\trademarkConstants.js`**
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:32:54 PM:** This file defined default selected filters for trademarks (`TM_DefaultSelectedFilters`) and hearings (`Hearing_DefaultSelectedFilters`), along with search filters and filter configurations. It initially included `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` as boolean flags in `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:39 PM:** The filter key `filter_active_status` within `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` was renamed to `active_flag`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM:** The filter key `filter_inactive_status` within `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` was renamed to `inactive_flag`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:34:18 PM:** The `TotalTrademark` React component was present, handling display and filtering logic for trademarks. Its `applyFilter` method used `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:34:36 PM:** The `applyFilter` function was updated to include `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` in its filter check condition, making these flags contribute to whether a filter is considered "applied".
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:15 PM:** The `applyFilter` function's destructuring was updated to use `active_flag` instead of `filter_active_status`, reflecting the change in `trademarkConstants.js`. A temporary syntax error (double `||`) was introduced in the filter check condition.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:22 PM:** The `applyFilter` function's destructuring was updated to use `inactive_flag` instead of `filter_inactive_status`. A typo (`filter_inactive_statu`) persisted in the filter check condition.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:22 PM:** The typo in the `applyFilter` condition was corrected to `inactive_flag`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\FilterComponents\FilterSearchBasic.jsx`**
    *   **2/13/2026, from 4:35:16 PM to 4:36:26 PM:** This entire `FilterSearchBasic` React component was commented out in the codebase, indicating it was temporarily disabled or undergoing major changes.
    *   **2/13/2026, 4:36:34 PM:** The entire file was uncommented, making the `FilterSearchBasic` component active again. A new section was added specifically for `filter_key === "trademarkStatus"`, introducing "Active" and "In-Active" checkboxes. The `isActive` and `isInactive` states were tied to `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` from `selectedFilters`. Deadlock protection logic was also added to prevent both checkboxes from being enabled/disabled simultaneously.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:44:50 PM:** The `isActive` variable definition was updated to read from `active_flag` (reflecting changes in `trademarkConstants.js`). A temporary bug was introduced in the `onChange` handler for the "Active" checkbox, where one `onSelect` call used an empty string as a key.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:44:57 PM:** The bug in the "Active" checkbox's `onChange` handler was partially fixed, using `active_flag` for the `switchValue` case.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:45:07 PM:** The `onChange` handler for the "Active" checkbox was fully corrected to consistently use `active_flag`.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:49:50 PM:** The `isInactive` variable definition was updated to read from `inactive_flag`, aligning with the constant renaming.
    *   **2/13/2026, 5:50:07 PM and 5:50:12 PM:** The `onChange` handler for the "In-Active" checkbox was updated in two steps to consistently use `inactive_flag` in both `onSelect` cases.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Filter Status Refactoring:** A prominent pattern is the refactoring of trademark status filters. The keys `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` were consistently renamed to `active_flag` and `inactive_flag` across the `trademarkConstants.js` constants file, the `TotalTrademark.jsx` component logic, and the `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` UI component. This indicates a system-wide effort to standardize filter names and implement corresponding UI controls.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The close timestamps for multiple changes in `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` and `TotalTrademark.jsx` (often within seconds or minutes) suggest rapid development, debugging, and saving cycles for implementing the new filter logic. This includes fixing syntax errors and ensuring consistent filter key usage across components.
*   **Modularity in Filtering:** The use of `FilterSearchBasic` as a common component indicates a modular approach to implementing filtering UI.
*   **Authentication and Error Handling:** Redux actions consistently implement token-based authentication (`localStorage.getItem("token")`) and centralized error handling (`checkAuthorisation(dispatch, err)`).
*   **Trademark-Specific Logic:** All changes are contained within the `trademarkDashboard` context, indicating focused development on trademark management features, including renewals, filtering, and UI components.
*   **Commented-out Code:** The consistently commented-out `getReplyToCorrespondence` function in `actions.js` and the temporary commenting out of the entire `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` component highlight code that is either under development, deprecated, or temporarily disabled.
