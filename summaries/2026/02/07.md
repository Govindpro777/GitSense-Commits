# Activity Summary for 2/7/2026

## 12:00:29 AM
The provided log details changes across several GitHub Actions workflow files and one React component file within the `iris-new` project.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-staging-pull-request.yml`**
    *   This workflow is configured to run tests on pull requests targeting the "ultimate-staging" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:19 PM - 1:21 PM)**: Initially used Node.js `16.19.0` with `actions/setup-node@v3`. This quickly changed to target Node.js `22`, with `node-version` being set to `.19.0` (likely a typo), then `22`, and finally `22.18.0` using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:24 PM - 1:28 PM)**: The `actions/checkout` action was updated from `v4` to `v4.4.3` at 1:24 PM, then later downgraded to `v3` at 1:27 PM.
    *   **GitHub Actions Node Setup Version (1:27 PM - 1:28 PM)**: The `actions/setup-node` action briefly reverted from `v4` to `v3` at 1:27 PM, then was immediately restored to `v4` at 1:28 PM.
    *   The workflow consistently includes steps for checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies with `npm ci --force`, and creating a build with `CI=false npm run build`. The "Test with Jest" step remains commented out throughout all versions.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-production-pull-request.yml`**
    *   This workflow is designed to run tests for pull requests targeting the "ultimate" (production) branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:21 PM)**: From its first appearance, it consistently targeted Node.js `22.18.0` using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:24 PM - 1:28 PM)**: Similar to the staging workflow, `actions/checkout` was updated from `v4` to `v4.4.3` at 1:24 PM and subsequently downgraded to `v3` at 1:28 PM.
    *   The build steps are identical to the staging PR workflow: checkout, setup Node, install dependencies, and create a build, with Jest tests commented out.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-staging.yml`**
    *   This workflow automates deployment to a staging environment upon pushes to the "ultimate-staging" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:22 PM)**: Consistently uses Node.js `22.18.0` via `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:22 PM - 1:28 PM)**: The `actions/checkout` version saw updates from `v4.2.3` to `v4.4.3` between 1:22 PM and 1:22 PM, then was downgraded to `v4.2.2` at 1:28 PM.
    *   **Deployment Process**: After building, the `build/` directory is uploaded as an artifact. A separate `deploy` job downloads this artifact, configures AWS credentials using GitHub secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), synchronizes the build output to an S3 bucket (`S3_BUCKET_STAGING`), and invalidates a CloudFront distribution (`CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_STAGING`). The staging environment URL is `https://irisnewdev.mikelegal.com/`.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-production.yml`**
    *   This workflow handles deployment to the production environment on pushes to the "ultimate" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:23 PM)**: Initially had a missing `node-version` specification, which was promptly corrected to `22.18.0` at 1:23 PM using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:23 PM - 1:29 PM)**: The `actions/checkout` version started at `v4.4.3`, then was downgraded to `v4.2.2` at 1:29 PM.
    *   **Deployment Process**: The deployment steps are structurally identical to the staging deployment, but they target production-specific AWS resources (`S3_BUCKET_PRODUCTION`, `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_PRODUCTION`) and the production URL `https://irisnew.mikelegal.com/`.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`**
    *   This file, first logged at 2/6/2026, 2:41:54 PM, is a React component responsible for a "Hearing" page.
    *   **Functionality**: It manages and displays hearing data (TLA and Opposition, verified/unverified states) using Redux Toolkit. It handles user authentication, data fetching based on URL (`/tla` or `/opposition`), and actions like updating location, sending reports, verifying records, and scanning.
    *   **User Interface**: Heavily relies on Ant Design components (Tabs, Table, Select, Popconfirm, Buttons) and custom styled components. It incorporates modals for CSV upload, adding rows, and searching.
    *   **Data Presentation**: The main content is a dynamic table displaying "Cause List Title", "Total count", "Profile count", "Reports", "Files" (PDF, Excel, Processed Excel with links), "Month", "Created", "Location", and "Actions". Action buttons vary based on the tab (unverified/verified) and root context, allowing verification (with checks for count mismatch or missing processed excel) or report sending.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **2/6/2026, 1:19 PM - 1:29 PM**: A rapid series of changes across all GitHub Actions workflow files. This period primarily focused on updating Node.js versions and adjusting versions of GitHub Actions (`checkout`, `setup-node`, `upload-artifact`, `download-artifact`). This indicates a concentrated effort to configure or standardize the CI/CD pipelines.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:20 PM - 1:21 PM**: Specific to `test-staging-pull-request.yml`, Node.js version was iterated from `16.19.0` to `22.18.0`.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:23 PM**: `deploy-production.yml` quickly had its `node-version` corrected from empty to `22.18.0`.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:24 PM**: `actions/checkout` updated to `v4.4.3` in `test-staging-pull-request.yml` and `test-production-pull-request.yml`.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:27 PM - 1:29 PM**: `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` versions were frequently downgraded and re-upgraded across `test-staging-pull-request.yml`, `test-production-pull-request.yml`, `deploy-staging.yml`, and `deploy-production.yml`.
*   **2/6/2026, 2:41 PM**: The `Hearing.tsx` file was last updated, indicating a functional change or addition to the application's UI/logic, separate from the CI/CD pipeline adjustments.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent Node.js Target**: All CI/CD workflows largely converge on using Node.js `22.18.0` for builds, handled by `actions/setup-node@v4`.
*   **Standard Build Process**: All workflows follow a consistent sequence: checkout code, setup Node.js, `npm ci --force` (install dependencies), and `CI=false npm run build` (create production build). The Jest testing step is consistently commented out.
*   **GitHub Actions Version Instability**: A notable pattern is the frequent iteration and minor backward/forward changes in the versions of GitHub Actions (specifically `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node`) within a short time frame, suggesting ongoing configuration or troubleshooting for the CI/CD setup.
*   **AWS-based Deployment**: Both staging and production deployment workflows (`deploy-staging.yml`, `deploy-production.yml`) share a common deployment strategy: build artifact upload/download, AWS credential configuration using secrets, S3 synchronization, and CloudFront invalidation, demonstrating a standardized cloud deployment approach for different environments.
*   **Environment Specifics via Secrets**: Deployment differences between staging and production are managed through environment-specific GitHub secrets for S3 buckets and CloudFront distributions, ensuring secure and flexible configuration.

## 2:02:15 PM
The log entries show a series of activities related to the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
All entries are for the same file, `Files.tsx`, which is a React component likely responsible for managing contract-related files within the MikeCLM application. The component utilizes Ant Design components for UI (Input, Button, Select, Pagination, etc.) and integrates with various utilities from `@mike-clm/shared` for file management, API interactions (`axiosInstance`), date conversion, and user data. It also includes functionality for handling file and folder uploads, downloading files, searching, sorting, and displaying file lists, potentially with progress bars and modals.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The entries are all timestamped on 2/7/2026, occurring in quick succession between 11:47:57 AM and 11:49:40 AM.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The most notable pattern is that the *exact same partial code snippet* is logged for each of the five entries. This suggests that while the file was saved or accessed multiple times within a short timeframe (less than two minutes), the content of the provided code section remained unchanged across these logs. The repeated identical snippets indicate either a high frequency of saves without substantive changes in this particular section of the code, or that the logging mechanism captured the same state repeatedly during a development session. The snippets consistently end abruptly, indicating they are fragments of a larger file.

## 2:02:16 PM
The `Workflow.jsx` file, logged on `2/6/2026, 5:40:13 PM`, defines the user interface and logic for managing document comparison workflows within the application.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\Workflow.jsx`**

This file is a React component responsible for:
*   **Workflow Display and Management:** It allows users to view, create, edit, and delete document comparison workflows, referred to as "presets."
*   **User Interface:** The component extensively uses Ant Design components such as `Modal`, `Spin`, `Typography`, `Flex`, and `Space`, along with custom UI components like `AppButton`, `AppAlert`, and `ItemCard1`.
*   **State and Data Management:**
    *   It utilizes a custom `useActionState` hook to manage the visibility and data for different UI actions, specifically for opening "delete confirmation" and "workflow detail" modals.
    *   Another custom hook, `usePresets`, is employed for fetching, loading, handling errors, and deleting workflow data.
*   **Navigation:** The `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom` is used to navigate to "create workflow" and "edit workflow" pages.
*   **Data Presentation:** Workflows are displayed as a list of `ItemCard1` components, each showing the workflow's name, description, and last update time.
*   **Loading and Error Handling:** A loading spinner is displayed while workflow data is being fetched, and an error message is shown if data retrieval fails.
*   **Modals:**
    *   A **Delete Confirmation Modal** is presented when a user attempts to delete a workflow, featuring a warning about previously generated presets and options to cancel or confirm deletion.
    *   A **Workflow Detail Modal** displays the `preset_name`, `preset_description`, and `preset_prompt` of a selected workflow.
*   **Example Functionality:** A `handleShowExample` function demonstrates how workflow details would appear by populating the workflow detail modal with a hardcoded example.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Ant Design Components:** The code heavily relies on Ant Design for its UI elements, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
*   **Custom Hooks:** The use of `useActionState` and `usePresets` indicates a pattern of encapsulating specific state management and data fetching logic into reusable hooks.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Loading states, error messages, and the display of actual workflow cards are all handled through conditional rendering based on the state of `presetsLoading` and `presetsError`.
*   **Modular Design:** Imports from `CommonComponents` and `CommonFuctions` suggest a modular approach to UI and utility functions.
*   **Modal-Driven Interactions:** Key user interactions like viewing details or confirming deletions are managed through dedicated modal components.

## 3:44:30 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\Workflow.jsx`, last updated on `2/6/2026, 5:40:13 PM`, implements the Workflow management page. This React component allows users to create, view, edit, and delete document comparison workflows, which are referred to as "presets" within the code.

Key functionalities include:
*   Displaying a list of existing workflows using `ItemCard1` components, each showing the workflow's name, description, and last update time.
*   Buttons to "Create a New Workflow" and "Show Example" workflow details.
*   Edit and delete actions for individual workflows, which navigate to an edit page or trigger a confirmation modal, respectively.
*   A modal for confirming the deletion of a workflow, including a warning about deleting previously generated presets.
*   A separate modal to display the detailed `preset_name`, `preset_description`, and `preset_prompt` of a selected workflow.
*   Handling loading states and displaying error messages when fetching workflows using `usePresets` hook.

The component extensively uses Ant Design components such as `Flex`, `Modal`, `Space`, `Spin`, and `Typography`, alongside custom UI components like `AppAlert`, `AppButton`, and `ItemCard1`. State management for modal visibility and data is handled via a custom `useActionState` hook, while workflow data fetching and deletion logic are encapsulated in a `usePresets` hook. The `preset_name`, `preset_description`, `preset_prompt`, `preset_id`, and `updated_at` fields are consistently used across workflow data and UI displays. Navigation within the application, such as creating or editing workflows, is managed using `react-router-dom`'s `useNavigate` hook.
