# Activity Summary for 2/7/2026

## 12:00:29 AM
The provided log details changes across several GitHub Actions workflow files and one React component file within the `iris-new` project.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-staging-pull-request.yml`**
    *   This workflow is configured to run tests on pull requests targeting the "ultimate-staging" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:19 PM - 1:21 PM)**: Initially used Node.js `16.19.0` with `actions/setup-node@v3`. This quickly changed to target Node.js `22`, with `node-version` being set to `.19.0` (likely a typo), then `22`, and finally `22.18.0` using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:24 PM - 1:28 PM)**: The `actions/checkout` action was updated from `v4` to `v4.4.3` at 1:24 PM, then later downgraded to `v3` at 1:27 PM.
    *   **GitHub Actions Node Setup Version (1:27 PM - 1:28 PM)**: The `actions/setup-node` action briefly reverted from `v4` to `v3` at 1:27 PM, then was immediately restored to `v4` at 1:28 PM.
    *   The workflow consistently includes steps for checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies with `npm ci --force`, and creating a build with `CI=false npm run build`. The "Test with Jest" step remains commented out throughout all versions.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-production-pull-request.yml`**
    *   This workflow is designed to run tests for pull requests targeting the "ultimate" (production) branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:21 PM)**: From its first appearance, it consistently targeted Node.js `22.18.0` using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:24 PM - 1:28 PM)**: Similar to the staging workflow, `actions/checkout` was updated from `v4` to `v4.4.3` at 1:24 PM and subsequently downgraded to `v3` at 1:28 PM.
    *   The build steps are identical to the staging PR workflow: checkout, setup Node, install dependencies, and create a build, with Jest tests commented out.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-staging.yml`**
    *   This workflow automates deployment to a staging environment upon pushes to the "ultimate-staging" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:22 PM)**: Consistently uses Node.js `22.18.0` via `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:22 PM - 1:28 PM)**: The `actions/checkout` version saw updates from `v4.2.3` to `v4.4.3` between 1:22 PM and 1:22 PM, then was downgraded to `v4.2.2` at 1:28 PM.
    *   **Deployment Process**: After building, the `build/` directory is uploaded as an artifact. A separate `deploy` job downloads this artifact, configures AWS credentials using GitHub secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), synchronizes the build output to an S3 bucket (`S3_BUCKET_STAGING`), and invalidates a CloudFront distribution (`CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_STAGING`). The staging environment URL is `https://irisnewdev.mikelegal.com/`.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-production.yml`**
    *   This workflow handles deployment to the production environment on pushes to the "ultimate" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:23 PM)**: Initially had a missing `node-version` specification, which was promptly corrected to `22.18.0` at 1:23 PM using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:23 PM - 1:29 PM)**: The `actions/checkout` version started at `v4.4.3`, then was downgraded to `v4.2.2` at 1:29 PM.
    *   **Deployment Process**: The deployment steps are structurally identical to the staging deployment, but they target production-specific AWS resources (`S3_BUCKET_PRODUCTION`, `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_PRODUCTION`) and the production URL `https://irisnew.mikelegal.com/`.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`**
    *   This file, first logged at 2/6/2026, 2:41:54 PM, is a React component responsible for a "Hearing" page.
    *   **Functionality**: It manages and displays hearing data (TLA and Opposition, verified/unverified states) using Redux Toolkit. It handles user authentication, data fetching based on URL (`/tla` or `/opposition`), and actions like updating location, sending reports, verifying records, and scanning.
    *   **User Interface**: Heavily relies on Ant Design components (Tabs, Table, Select, Popconfirm, Buttons) and custom styled components. It incorporates modals for CSV upload, adding rows, and searching.
    *   **Data Presentation**: The main content is a dynamic table displaying "Cause List Title", "Total count", "Profile count", "Reports", "Files" (PDF, Excel, Processed Excel with links), "Month", "Created", "Location", and "Actions". Action buttons vary based on the tab (unverified/verified) and root context, allowing verification (with checks for count mismatch or missing processed excel) or report sending.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **2/6/2026, 1:19 PM - 1:29 PM**: A rapid series of changes across all GitHub Actions workflow files. This period primarily focused on updating Node.js versions and adjusting versions of GitHub Actions (`checkout`, `setup-node`, `upload-artifact`, `download-artifact`). This indicates a concentrated effort to configure or standardize the CI/CD pipelines.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:20 PM - 1:21 PM**: Specific to `test-staging-pull-request.yml`, Node.js version was iterated from `16.19.0` to `22.18.0`.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:23 PM**: `deploy-production.yml` quickly had its `node-version` corrected from empty to `22.18.0`.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:24 PM**: `actions/checkout` updated to `v4.4.3` in `test-staging-pull-request.yml` and `test-production-pull-request.yml`.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:27 PM - 1:29 PM**: `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` versions were frequently downgraded and re-upgraded across `test-staging-pull-request.yml`, `test-production-pull-request.yml`, `deploy-staging.yml`, and `deploy-production.yml`.
*   **2/6/2026, 2:41 PM**: The `Hearing.tsx` file was last updated, indicating a functional change or addition to the application's UI/logic, separate from the CI/CD pipeline adjustments.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent Node.js Target**: All CI/CD workflows largely converge on using Node.js `22.18.0` for builds, handled by `actions/setup-node@v4`.
*   **Standard Build Process**: All workflows follow a consistent sequence: checkout code, setup Node.js, `npm ci --force` (install dependencies), and `CI=false npm run build` (create production build). The Jest testing step is consistently commented out.
*   **GitHub Actions Version Instability**: A notable pattern is the frequent iteration and minor backward/forward changes in the versions of GitHub Actions (specifically `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node`) within a short time frame, suggesting ongoing configuration or troubleshooting for the CI/CD setup.
*   **AWS-based Deployment**: Both staging and production deployment workflows (`deploy-staging.yml`, `deploy-production.yml`) share a common deployment strategy: build artifact upload/download, AWS credential configuration using secrets, S3 synchronization, and CloudFront invalidation, demonstrating a standardized cloud deployment approach for different environments.
*   **Environment Specifics via Secrets**: Deployment differences between staging and production are managed through environment-specific GitHub secrets for S3 buckets and CloudFront distributions, ensuring secure and flexible configuration.

## 2:02:15 PM
The log entries show a series of activities related to the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
All entries are for the same file, `Files.tsx`, which is a React component likely responsible for managing contract-related files within the MikeCLM application. The component utilizes Ant Design components for UI (Input, Button, Select, Pagination, etc.) and integrates with various utilities from `@mike-clm/shared` for file management, API interactions (`axiosInstance`), date conversion, and user data. It also includes functionality for handling file and folder uploads, downloading files, searching, sorting, and displaying file lists, potentially with progress bars and modals.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The entries are all timestamped on 2/7/2026, occurring in quick succession between 11:47:57 AM and 11:49:40 AM.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The most notable pattern is that the *exact same partial code snippet* is logged for each of the five entries. This suggests that while the file was saved or accessed multiple times within a short timeframe (less than two minutes), the content of the provided code section remained unchanged across these logs. The repeated identical snippets indicate either a high frequency of saves without substantive changes in this particular section of the code, or that the logging mechanism captured the same state repeatedly during a development session. The snippets consistently end abruptly, indicating they are fragments of a larger file.

## 2:02:16 PM
The `Workflow.jsx` file, logged on `2/6/2026, 5:40:13 PM`, defines the user interface and logic for managing document comparison workflows within the application.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\Workflow.jsx`**

This file is a React component responsible for:
*   **Workflow Display and Management:** It allows users to view, create, edit, and delete document comparison workflows, referred to as "presets."
*   **User Interface:** The component extensively uses Ant Design components such as `Modal`, `Spin`, `Typography`, `Flex`, and `Space`, along with custom UI components like `AppButton`, `AppAlert`, and `ItemCard1`.
*   **State and Data Management:**
    *   It utilizes a custom `useActionState` hook to manage the visibility and data for different UI actions, specifically for opening "delete confirmation" and "workflow detail" modals.
    *   Another custom hook, `usePresets`, is employed for fetching, loading, handling errors, and deleting workflow data.
*   **Navigation:** The `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom` is used to navigate to "create workflow" and "edit workflow" pages.
*   **Data Presentation:** Workflows are displayed as a list of `ItemCard1` components, each showing the workflow's name, description, and last update time.
*   **Loading and Error Handling:** A loading spinner is displayed while workflow data is being fetched, and an error message is shown if data retrieval fails.
*   **Modals:**
    *   A **Delete Confirmation Modal** is presented when a user attempts to delete a workflow, featuring a warning about previously generated presets and options to cancel or confirm deletion.
    *   A **Workflow Detail Modal** displays the `preset_name`, `preset_description`, and `preset_prompt` of a selected workflow.
*   **Example Functionality:** A `handleShowExample` function demonstrates how workflow details would appear by populating the workflow detail modal with a hardcoded example.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Ant Design Components:** The code heavily relies on Ant Design for its UI elements, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
*   **Custom Hooks:** The use of `useActionState` and `usePresets` indicates a pattern of encapsulating specific state management and data fetching logic into reusable hooks.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Loading states, error messages, and the display of actual workflow cards are all handled through conditional rendering based on the state of `presetsLoading` and `presetsError`.
*   **Modular Design:** Imports from `CommonComponents` and `CommonFuctions` suggest a modular approach to UI and utility functions.
*   **Modal-Driven Interactions:** Key user interactions like viewing details or confirming deletions are managed through dedicated modal components.

## 3:44:30 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\Workflow.jsx`, last updated on `2/6/2026, 5:40:13 PM`, implements the Workflow management page. This React component allows users to create, view, edit, and delete document comparison workflows, which are referred to as "presets" within the code.

Key functionalities include:
*   Displaying a list of existing workflows using `ItemCard1` components, each showing the workflow's name, description, and last update time.
*   Buttons to "Create a New Workflow" and "Show Example" workflow details.
*   Edit and delete actions for individual workflows, which navigate to an edit page or trigger a confirmation modal, respectively.
*   A modal for confirming the deletion of a workflow, including a warning about deleting previously generated presets.
*   A separate modal to display the detailed `preset_name`, `preset_description`, and `preset_prompt` of a selected workflow.
*   Handling loading states and displaying error messages when fetching workflows using `usePresets` hook.

The component extensively uses Ant Design components such as `Flex`, `Modal`, `Space`, `Spin`, and `Typography`, alongside custom UI components like `AppAlert`, `AppButton`, and `ItemCard1`. State management for modal visibility and data is handled via a custom `useActionState` hook, while workflow data fetching and deletion logic are encapsulated in a `usePresets` hook. The `preset_name`, `preset_description`, `preset_prompt`, `preset_id`, and `updated_at` fields are consistently used across workflow data and UI displays. Navigation within the application, such as creating or editing workflows, is managed using `react-router-dom`'s `useNavigate` hook.

## 3:44:43 PM
The provided log details changes across several GitHub Actions workflow files and one React component file within the `iris-new` repository.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-staging-pull-request.yml`**: This workflow, responsible for testing pull requests against the "ultimate-staging" branch, underwent several modifications.
    *   Initially, it used Node.js v16.19.0 with `actions/setup-node@v3` and `actions/checkout@v4`.
    *   Within a few minutes (around 1:20 PM on 2/6/2026), the Node.js version was updated to v22 (specifically 22.18.0), and `actions/setup-node` was upgraded to `v4`.
    *   Later, `actions/checkout` was updated to `v4.4.3` (around 1:24 PM) but then reverted to `v3` (around 1:27 PM). There was also a brief revert of `actions/setup-node` to `v3` before it was set back to `v4` (around 1:28 PM).
    *   The core steps for installing dependencies (`npm ci --force`) and building (`CI=false npm run build`) remained consistent throughout.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-production-pull-request.yml`**: This workflow, triggered by pull requests to the "ultimate" branch, is similar in structure to its staging counterpart.
    *   It consistently used Node.js v22.18.0 with `actions/setup-node@v4` from the first logged entry (1:21:52 PM on 2/6/2026).
    *   The `actions/checkout` version was updated from `v4` to `v4.4.3` (around 1:24 PM) and subsequently reverted to `v3` (around 1:28 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-staging.yml`**: This workflow handles deployment to the staging environment (irisnewdev.mikelegal.com) on pushes to "ultimate-staging."
    *   It uses Node.js v22.18.0 and `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   The `actions/checkout` version was initially `v4.2.3` (1:22:20 PM), updated to `v4.4.3` (1:22:46 PM), and then changed to `v4.2.2` (1:28:43 PM).
    *   Deployment steps include building, uploading artifacts, configuring AWS credentials (using secrets), syncing the `build/` directory to an S3 bucket, and invalidating a CloudFront distribution.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-production.yml`**: This workflow manages deployments to the production environment (irisnew.mikelegal.com) on pushes to the "ultimate" branch.
    *   An initial log entry (1:23:20 PM) showed a missing Node.js version which was quickly corrected to `22.18.0` (1:23:28 PM).
    *   The `actions/checkout` version started at `v4.4.3` and was later adjusted to `v4.2.2` (1:29:01 PM).
    *   The deployment process mirrors the staging workflow, involving building, artifact management, AWS S3 synchronization, and CloudFront invalidation, utilizing production-specific secrets.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`**: This React component file is central to the "Hearings" page, displaying TLA and Opposition journals using Ant Design. It includes functionality for fetching data, verifying entries, updating locations, sending reports, and handling file uploads. Styled-components are used for styling. Despite multiple log entries spanning from 2:41:54 PM on 2/6/2026 to 10:31:23 AM on 2/7/2026, the code content for this file remained identical across all timestamps, indicating no functional changes were recorded during this period.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **~1:20 PM - 1:22 PM on 2/6/2026**: Initial surge of changes in `test-staging-pull-request.yml` focusing on Node.js version upgrades (from v16 to v22.18.0) and updating `actions/setup-node` to `v4`.
*   **~1:22 PM - 1:24 PM on 2/6/2026**: Setup and initial adjustments for `deploy-staging.yml` and `deploy-production.yml`, including a quick fix for a missing Node.js version in the production deployment.

*   **~1:27 PM - 1:29 PM on 2/6/2026**: A period of adjustments and reverts to `actions/checkout` versions (to `v3` or `v4.2.2`) and `actions/setup-node` (`v3` then back to `v4`) across the different GitHub Actions workflows, suggesting fine-tuning or troubleshooting of action versions.
*   **2:41:54 PM on 2/6/2026 to 10:31:23 AM on 2/7/2026**: While this timeframe shows multiple logs for `Hearing.tsx`, there are no actual code changes.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **GitHub Actions Modernization:** There's a clear pattern of updating GitHub Actions to newer versions (`actions/setup-node@v3` to `v4`) and upgrading the Node.js runtime environment to `v22.18.0` across all test and deploy workflows.
*   **`actions/checkout` Version Instability:** The `actions/checkout` action experienced frequent version changes (`v4`, `v4.4.3`, `v3`, `v4.2.2`) across different workflows, suggesting that the team might have been experimenting with or troubleshooting compatibility issues with specific `actions/checkout` versions.
*   **Consistent Build Process:** All workflows that involve building consistently use `npm ci --force` for dependency installation and `CI=false npm run build` for generating the application build, along with caching npm modules.
*   **Standard AWS Deployment Strategy:** Both staging and production deployment workflows follow a similar robust pattern for AWS integration: artifact handling, secure credential configuration via secrets, S3 synchronization, and CloudFront cache invalidation.
*   **Static `Hearing.tsx` Content:** The `Hearing.tsx` file, despite being logged multiple times, showed no content changes, implying its code was stable or not actively being modified/committed during the captured period.

## 3:44:45 PM
The changes log details updates across two main files within the `clm-frontend` application, primarily focusing on file and folder management features.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**

*   **Timestamps: 2/7/2026, 11:47:57 AM to 2/7/2026, 11:49:40 AM**
*   **Key Updates:** Across five entries within a two-minute span, the code content for this file remained identical in the provided snippets. This indicates that either no functional changes occurred within the visible code sections during this period, or the changes were very minor and outside the scope of the logged snippets.
*   **Content Overview:** This React functional component, `Files`, is responsible for comprehensive contract file management. It integrates Ant Design components for UI (Input, Button, Select, Pagination, etc.) and various icons (SearchOutlined, DownloadOutlined, DeleteOutlined). It leverages `axiosInstance` for API calls to `/api/contract-documents/` for operations like getting S3 signed URLs, adding documents, and handling file uploads and downloads. State management includes `useState` for search text, selected items, pagination, sort order, and upload status. It also uses `useRef` for file/directory input elements and `AbortController` for upload cancellation. Key functions include `handleSelectedDownload`, `getSignedUrl`, `uploadFile`, `handleFileChange` (for single files), and `handleDirectoryInputChange` (for folders). Files are filtered, sorted, and grouped into folders or individual files for display, with pagination applied.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx`**

*   **Timestamps: 2/7/2026, 2:04:55 PM to 2/7/2026, 2:15:07 PM**
*   **Key Updates:** This file underwent several iterative changes, primarily concerning the `canDeleteFolder` permission logic and the rendering of the delete button for folders.
    *   **2:04:55 PM:** The component's initial state in the log, responsible for displaying files/folders, handling selection, download, delete, and rename. It includes a `canDeleteFolder` function that checks `delete_contract_document` permissions for all files within a folder.
    *   **2:09:36 PM:** Introduction of a `canDeleteThisFolder` variable, initially within the file rendering logic, suggesting an intent to apply permission checks more granularly.
    *   **2:10:07 PM:** The `canDeleteThisFolder` variable is correctly moved to be evaluated for folder nodes, and the delete button for non-root folders is updated to be `disabled` if `canDeleteThisFolder` is `false`.
    *   **2:10:32 PM:** A brief, logically incorrect change was introduced where the delete button was `disabled` if `canDeleteThisFolder` was `true`, effectively inversing the intended logic.
    *   **2:11:42 PM:** The `canDeleteFolder` function's internal logic was significantly altered, introducing a bug that caused it to *always* return `false`, thereby preventing all folder deletions. This bug persisted through the **2:12:15 PM** entry.
    *   **2:12:48 PM:** The `canDeleteFolder` function's logic was reverted to its correct, original implementation, allowing folder deletion only if all contained files permit deletion.
    *   **2:14:10 PM:** The UI for the delete button for non-root folders was refined. Instead of rendering a disabled button, the button is now conditionally rendered *only if* `canDeleteThisFolder` is `true`.
    *   **2:14:35 PM:** The `canDeleteFolder` function's buggy logic (always returning `false`) was reintroduced.
    *   **2:14:42 PM:** The `canDeleteFolder` function's logic was *again* reverted to its correct, permission-checking implementation. The subsequent entries (**2:14:58 PM** and **2:15:07 PM**) show no further changes to the visible code.
*   **Content Overview:** This `FileManagerGrid` component is responsible for rendering a hierarchical view of files and folders using Ant Design's `Checkbox` and custom icons. It constructs a `treeData` structure from a flat list of `FilesListItem` objects, allowing for folder expansion, bulk selection, and individual file/folder actions (download, delete, rename). It uses `useFileManager` for core file operations. Modals (`DeleteModal`, `UpdateFileNameModal`) are used for user interactions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frontend Development Focus:** Both files are React components written in TypeScript, using hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`), Ant Design for UI, and `axios` for API interactions.
*   **File and Folder Management:** The core functionality across both files is centered around managing documents within a contract, including uploading, downloading, searching, sorting, deleting, and displaying in a structured (grid/tree) format.
*   **Permission-Based Actions:** There is a clear pattern of implementing permission checks, especially for critical actions like deletion, as evidenced by the `canDeleteFolder` function and its integration with UI elements.
*   **Iterative Refinement/Debugging:** The repeated changes and reverts to the `canDeleteFolder` function in `FileManagerGrid.tsx` within a short timeframe strongly suggest active development, debugging, or re-evaluation of the exact permission logic and its UI representation. This indicates a focus on ensuring correct and robust access control for deletion functionality.
*   **Use of Shared Utilities:** Both components utilize utilities from `@mike-clm/shared` such as `axiosInstance`, `convertDate`, `userDataSelector`, `useFileManager`, `handleAxiosError`, and data interfaces like `FilesListItem`, `TreeNode`. This promotes code reusability and a consistent approach to data handling and API interaction.

## 5:11:49 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\Workflow.jsx`, last updated on **2/6/2026, 5:40:13 PM**, defines a React component responsible for managing document comparison workflows, referred to as "presets".

**File-Specific Updates and Functionality:**

*   **Workflow Management UI:** The component provides a user interface to display, create, view, edit, and delete workflow presets.
*   **Ant Design Integration:** It heavily utilizes Ant Design components such as `Modal`, `Spin`, `Typography`, `Flex`, and icons (`LoadingOutlined`, `PlusOutlined`) for UI elements and user interactions.
*   **Data Handling:**
    *   It imports and uses a `usePresets` custom hook, suggesting it fetches and manages workflow data (e.g., `workflows`, `presetsLoading`, `presetsError`).
    *   A `deletePreset` function is also imported and used for removing workflows.
*   **Action Management:** The `useActionState` hook is employed to manage different UI states, specifically for displaying a `deleteConfirmModal` and a `workflowDetailModal`.
*   **Workflow Operations:**
    *   **Creation:** A "Create a New Workflow" button navigates to a `create` route.
    *   **Viewing:** Clicking on an `ItemCard1` (representing a workflow) opens a `workflowDetailModal` displaying the preset's name, description, and prompt. An `handleShowExample` function demonstrates this with sample data.
    *   **Editing:** An "Edit" action on a workflow card navigates to an `edit/:id` route.
    *   **Deletion:** A "Delete" action triggers a confirmation `Modal` warning the user about deleting previously generated presets before executing the `deletePreset` function.
*   **User Feedback:** The component displays loading indicators (`Spin`) while presets are being fetched and error messages if data retrieval fails.
*   **Styling:** It imports styles from `Workflow.module.scss`.

The component follows a standard pattern for managing a list of items with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, using modals for details and confirmations, and handling various UI states like loading and errors.

## 5:12:05 PM
The log details changes across two frontend React components within the `MikeCLM` application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 2/7/2026, 11:47:57 AM to 2/7/2026, 11:49:40 AM
    *   **Updates:** No discernible code changes were made across the provided log entries for this file. All snippets are identical. The file appears to implement a `Files` component responsible for displaying and managing files within a contract, including search, sorting, pagination, file/folder uploads (with progress tracking and conflict resolution for existing files), and download capabilities. It leverages `useFileManager` for core file operations and integrates Ant Design components for UI.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 2/7/2026, 2:04:55 PM to 2/7/2026, 2:15:07 PM
    *   **Updates:** This file, which appears to render the file and folder structure as a grid, underwent several specific modifications related to the "delete" functionality for folders.
        *   **Initial State (2/7/2026, 2:04:55 PM):** The delete button for non-root folders was always rendered, and the `canDeleteFolder` function correctly determined if a folder could be deleted by checking permissions of all contained files.
        *   **2/7/2026, 2:10:32 PM:** The delete button for non-root folders was updated to be *disabled* if the `canDeleteThisFolder` permission check failed.
        *   **2/7/2026, 2:11:42 PM:** A temporary bug was introduced in the `canDeleteFolder` function, causing it to incorrectly always return `false`.
        *   **2/7/2026, 2:12:15 PM:** The bug in `canDeleteFolder` was immediately reverted and fixed, restoring its original, correct logic.
        *   **2/7/2026, 2:14:10 PM:** The delete button for non-root folders was further refined. Instead of being rendered and then disabled, it was changed to be *conditionally rendered*. The button now only appears if `canDeleteThisFolder` is true, effectively hiding the delete option if the user lacks permissions. The delete button for root folders remained unconditionally rendered (without the permission check for rendering, only for action).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/7/2026, 2:10:32 PM:** Introduction of disabling the delete button based on permissions in `FileManagerGrid.tsx`.
*   **2/7/2026, 2:11:42 PM:** Accidental introduction of a bug in `canDeleteFolder` in `FileManagerGrid.tsx`.
*   **2/7/2026, 2:12:15 PM:** Rapid correction/reversion of the `canDeleteFolder` bug in `FileManagerGrid.tsx`.
*   **2/7/2026, 2:14:10 PM:** Change from disabling to conditional rendering for the non-root folder delete button in `FileManagerGrid.tsx`.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration:** The timestamps are very close together, especially for `FileManagerGrid.tsx`, indicating quick development iterations, immediate bug fixes, and minor UI/UX adjustments.
*   **Focus on Folder Delete Permissions:** A recurring theme in `FileManagerGrid.tsx` is the continuous refinement of the folder deletion mechanism, specifically how permissions (`canDeleteFolder`) affect the visibility and interactivity of the delete button for both individual files and folders. There's a distinction made between root and non-root folders in their action button rendering.
*   **Redundant Log Entries:** Multiple log entries for `Files.tsx` and some for `FileManagerGrid.tsx` show identical code content, which might suggest frequent saves, automated logging, or commit messages without actual code alterations.

## 6:11:55 PM
The changes primarily focus on two main feature areas: workflow management and a chatbot interface.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\Workflow.jsx` (Timestamp: 2/6/2026, 5:40:13 PM)**
    This file introduces a React component responsible for managing document comparison workflows. It allows users to:
    *   Create new workflows.
    *   View details of existing workflows (including a preset name, description, and prompt).
    *   Edit existing workflows.
    *   Delete workflows, which includes a confirmation modal with a warning about associated presets.
    *   Display a sample workflow using example data.
    The component integrates with Ant Design for UI elements (Modals, Spinners, Typography, Buttons) and custom application components for alerts and cards. It also uses custom hooks (`useActionState`, `usePresets`) for state management and data fetching.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\assets\docchat\ThreeDotOutlined.jsx` (Timestamp: 2/7/2026, 5:29:37 PM and 2/7/2026, 5:29:44 PM)**
    *   **Initial change (5:29:37 PM):** A new React component `ThreeDotOutlined` was added to render a simple SVG icon depicting three dots. The `fill` attribute of the SVG path was initially empty.
    *   **Subsequent change (5:29:44 PM):** Almost immediately, the `fill` attribute of the SVG path was updated to `#000000`, explicitly setting the icon's color to black. This was a quick styling fix or refinement for the newly added icon.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\Chatbot\index.jsx` (Timestamp: 2/7/2026, 5:41:24 PM and multiple identical entries until 2/7/2026, 6:11:07 PM)**
    This large React component implements a comprehensive chatbot feature. Key functionalities include:
    *   **Chat Interface:** Enables real-time user interaction via WebSockets, sending messages, and receiving assistant responses. It manages chat history and ensures new messages are scrolled into view.
    *   **Workflow Integration (Presets):** Features a "Workflow" tab allowing users to apply ready-made or custom presets to extract data from uploaded documents. It displays a "processing" badge on the tab.
    *   **Feedback Mechanism:** Incorporates a feedback system for both chat and preset responses, where users can select predefined tags (e.g., "Incomplete Response," "Not relevant") or provide custom feedback.
    *   **Export Functionality:** Supports exporting documents and presets. A specific modal (`unanalyzedFilesModal`) handles scenarios where some files might not have been analyzed during a preset export, especially for document collections.
    *   **State and UI Management:** Leverages numerous React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`), Ant Design components, Redux for global state, `react-router-dom` for navigation, and custom utility functions and hooks (`useWebSocket`, `useExportDocument`, `usePresets`, `useActionState`).
    *   **Analytics:** Integrates `trackButtonClick` for Mixpanel analytics on user interactions like sending messages, clearing chat, or selecting presets.
    *   **UI Components:** Employs `AppTabs` for tab navigation, `PresetDropdownItem` for preset selection, and `ResizableTextArea` for user input.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/6/2026, 5:40:13 PM:** Introduction of the Workflow management page component.
*   **2/7/2026, 5:29:44 PM:** A minor but immediate styling correction for the `ThreeDotOutlined` SVG icon.
*   **2/7/2026, 5:41:24 PM:** Introduction of the main Chatbot component with extensive functionality.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Ant Design Usage:** Both `Workflow.jsx` and `Chatbot/index.jsx` extensively use Ant Design components (Modal, Spin, Typography, Button, Dropdown, Tooltip, Badge, etc.) for a consistent UI.
*   **Custom Hooks:** There's a clear pattern of using custom hooks like `useActionState` and `usePresets` for managing component-specific logic, state, and data fetching, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
*   **Redux Integration:** The `Chatbot/index.jsx` file explicitly uses `react-redux` (`connect`, `useSelector`) to interact with the application's global state, particularly for user information and chat actions.
*   **Navigation:** Both major components utilize `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` for routing within the application.
*   **Identical Code Across Timestamps:** A notable pattern for `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\Chatbot\index.jsx` is the presence of multiple log entries with identical code content over a short period (approximately 30 minutes). This suggests repeated saves or version control commits without actual code changes, rather than a series of distinct functional updates within these specific timestamps in the log.
*   **File Naming Convention:** The file paths indicate a structured directory layout, often grouping features (e.g., `Features/SettingPage/Workflow`, `Features/Chatbot`) and assets (e.g., `assets/docchat`).
