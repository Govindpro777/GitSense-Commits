# Activity Summary for 2/7/2026

## 12:00:29 AM
The provided log details changes across several GitHub Actions workflow files and one React component file within the `iris-new` project.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-staging-pull-request.yml`**
    *   This workflow is configured to run tests on pull requests targeting the "ultimate-staging" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:19 PM - 1:21 PM)**: Initially used Node.js `16.19.0` with `actions/setup-node@v3`. This quickly changed to target Node.js `22`, with `node-version` being set to `.19.0` (likely a typo), then `22`, and finally `22.18.0` using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:24 PM - 1:28 PM)**: The `actions/checkout` action was updated from `v4` to `v4.4.3` at 1:24 PM, then later downgraded to `v3` at 1:27 PM.
    *   **GitHub Actions Node Setup Version (1:27 PM - 1:28 PM)**: The `actions/setup-node` action briefly reverted from `v4` to `v3` at 1:27 PM, then was immediately restored to `v4` at 1:28 PM.
    *   The workflow consistently includes steps for checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies with `npm ci --force`, and creating a build with `CI=false npm run build`. The "Test with Jest" step remains commented out throughout all versions.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-production-pull-request.yml`**
    *   This workflow is designed to run tests for pull requests targeting the "ultimate" (production) branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:21 PM)**: From its first appearance, it consistently targeted Node.js `22.18.0` using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:24 PM - 1:28 PM)**: Similar to the staging workflow, `actions/checkout` was updated from `v4` to `v4.4.3` at 1:24 PM and subsequently downgraded to `v3` at 1:28 PM.
    *   The build steps are identical to the staging PR workflow: checkout, setup Node, install dependencies, and create a build, with Jest tests commented out.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-staging.yml`**
    *   This workflow automates deployment to a staging environment upon pushes to the "ultimate-staging" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:22 PM)**: Consistently uses Node.js `22.18.0` via `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:22 PM - 1:28 PM)**: The `actions/checkout` version saw updates from `v4.2.3` to `v4.4.3` between 1:22 PM and 1:22 PM, then was downgraded to `v4.2.2` at 1:28 PM.
    *   **Deployment Process**: After building, the `build/` directory is uploaded as an artifact. A separate `deploy` job downloads this artifact, configures AWS credentials using GitHub secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), synchronizes the build output to an S3 bucket (`S3_BUCKET_STAGING`), and invalidates a CloudFront distribution (`CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_STAGING`). The staging environment URL is `https://irisnewdev.mikelegal.com/`.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-production.yml`**
    *   This workflow handles deployment to the production environment on pushes to the "ultimate" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning (1:23 PM)**: Initially had a missing `node-version` specification, which was promptly corrected to `22.18.0` at 1:23 PM using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **GitHub Actions Checkout Version (1:23 PM - 1:29 PM)**: The `actions/checkout` version started at `v4.4.3`, then was downgraded to `v4.2.2` at 1:29 PM.
    *   **Deployment Process**: The deployment steps are structurally identical to the staging deployment, but they target production-specific AWS resources (`S3_BUCKET_PRODUCTION`, `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_PRODUCTION`) and the production URL `https://irisnew.mikelegal.com/`.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`**
    *   This file, first logged at 2/6/2026, 2:41:54 PM, is a React component responsible for a "Hearing" page.
    *   **Functionality**: It manages and displays hearing data (TLA and Opposition, verified/unverified states) using Redux Toolkit. It handles user authentication, data fetching based on URL (`/tla` or `/opposition`), and actions like updating location, sending reports, verifying records, and scanning.
    *   **User Interface**: Heavily relies on Ant Design components (Tabs, Table, Select, Popconfirm, Buttons) and custom styled components. It incorporates modals for CSV upload, adding rows, and searching.
    *   **Data Presentation**: The main content is a dynamic table displaying "Cause List Title", "Total count", "Profile count", "Reports", "Files" (PDF, Excel, Processed Excel with links), "Month", "Created", "Location", and "Actions". Action buttons vary based on the tab (unverified/verified) and root context, allowing verification (with checks for count mismatch or missing processed excel) or report sending.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **2/6/2026, 1:19 PM - 1:29 PM**: A rapid series of changes across all GitHub Actions workflow files. This period primarily focused on updating Node.js versions and adjusting versions of GitHub Actions (`checkout`, `setup-node`, `upload-artifact`, `download-artifact`). This indicates a concentrated effort to configure or standardize the CI/CD pipelines.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:20 PM - 1:21 PM**: Specific to `test-staging-pull-request.yml`, Node.js version was iterated from `16.19.0` to `22.18.0`.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:23 PM**: `deploy-production.yml` quickly had its `node-version` corrected from empty to `22.18.0`.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:24 PM**: `actions/checkout` updated to `v4.4.3` in `test-staging-pull-request.yml` and `test-production-pull-request.yml`.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:27 PM - 1:29 PM**: `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` versions were frequently downgraded and re-upgraded across `test-staging-pull-request.yml`, `test-production-pull-request.yml`, `deploy-staging.yml`, and `deploy-production.yml`.
*   **2/6/2026, 2:41 PM**: The `Hearing.tsx` file was last updated, indicating a functional change or addition to the application's UI/logic, separate from the CI/CD pipeline adjustments.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent Node.js Target**: All CI/CD workflows largely converge on using Node.js `22.18.0` for builds, handled by `actions/setup-node@v4`.
*   **Standard Build Process**: All workflows follow a consistent sequence: checkout code, setup Node.js, `npm ci --force` (install dependencies), and `CI=false npm run build` (create production build). The Jest testing step is consistently commented out.
*   **GitHub Actions Version Instability**: A notable pattern is the frequent iteration and minor backward/forward changes in the versions of GitHub Actions (specifically `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node`) within a short time frame, suggesting ongoing configuration or troubleshooting for the CI/CD setup.
*   **AWS-based Deployment**: Both staging and production deployment workflows (`deploy-staging.yml`, `deploy-production.yml`) share a common deployment strategy: build artifact upload/download, AWS credential configuration using secrets, S3 synchronization, and CloudFront invalidation, demonstrating a standardized cloud deployment approach for different environments.
*   **Environment Specifics via Secrets**: Deployment differences between staging and production are managed through environment-specific GitHub secrets for S3 buckets and CloudFront distributions, ensuring secure and flexible configuration.
