# Activity Summary for 2/6/2026

## 2:13:31 PM
The provided log details a series of rapid changes to GitHub Actions workflow files, all occurring on February 6, 2026, between 1:19:57 PM and 1:29:01 PM. These changes primarily involve updating action versions and Node.js configurations across testing and deployment workflows.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-staging-pull-request.yml`**
    *   **Initial State (1:19:57 PM):** Configured to run on `pull_request` to the `ultimate-staging` branch, using Node.js `16.19.0` (`actions/setup-node@v3`) and `actions/checkout@v4`. It installs dependencies (`npm ci --force`) and builds (`CI=false npm run build`), with tests commented out.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (1:20:24 PM - 1:21:27 PM):** The Node.js version was progressively updated from `16.19.0` to `22`, then refined to `22.18.0`. The `actions/setup-node` action was also updated from `@v3` to `@v4` during this period.
    *   **Later Changes (1:24:14 PM - 1:28:01 PM):** The `actions/checkout` version saw several updates and reverts, moving from `@v4` to `@v4.4.3`, then back to `@v3`. Similarly, `actions/setup-node` briefly reverted to `@v3` (1:27:47 PM) before being set back to `@v4` (1:28:01 PM).

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-production-pull-request.yml`**
    *   **Initial State (1:21:52 PM):** This workflow for `pull_request` to the `ultimate` branch mirrored the `test-staging-pull-request.yml`'s final Node.js configuration, using `22.18.0` with `actions/setup-node@v4` and `actions/checkout@v4`. Tests were also commented out.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (1:24:23 PM - 1:28:13 PM):** The `actions/checkout` version was updated from `@v4` to `@v4.4.3` and then reverted to `@v3`.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-staging.yml`**
    *   **Initial State (1:22:20 PM):** This deployment workflow triggers on `push` to `ultimate-staging`. It consists of `build` and `deploy` jobs. The `build` job uses `actions/checkout@v4.2.3`, Node.js `22.18.0` (`actions/setup-node@v4`), builds the project, and uploads artifacts using `actions/upload-artifact@v4.4.3`. The `deploy` job downloads artifacts (`actions/download-artifact@v4.1.8`), configures AWS credentials, syncs built files to an S3 bucket, and invalidates a CloudFront distribution, all using secrets for sensitive information.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (1:22:46 PM - 1:28:43 PM):** The `actions/checkout` version was updated from `@v4.2.3` to `@v4.4.3`, and then later changed to `@v4.2.2`.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-production.yml`**
    *   **Initial State (1:23:20 PM):** This workflow triggers on `push` to the `ultimate` branch and is structurally identical to the `deploy-staging.yml` file, but targets a production environment URL (`https://irisnew.mikelegal.com/`) and uses production-specific AWS secrets (S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution). Notably, the initial configuration had a blank `node-version`.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (1:23:28 PM - 1:29:01 PM):** The `node-version` was immediately corrected to `22.18.0`. The `actions/checkout` version, initially `@v4.4.3`, was later updated to `@v4.2.2`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Workflow Structure:** All workflows follow a standard pattern for Node.js projects in GitHub Actions: checkout code, set up Node.js, install dependencies (`npm ci --force`), and build the project (`CI=false npm run build`).
*   **Node.js Version Target:** A consistent effort was made to standardize the Node.js version to `22.18.0` across all workflows, with `actions/setup-node@v4` being the preferred action version for this.
*   **Action Version Fluctuations:** There were frequent updates and subsequent reverts or minor adjustments to the versions of GitHub Actions used, particularly `actions/checkout` (cycling through `@v4`, `@v4.4.3`, `@v3`, `@v4.2.2`, `@v4.2.3`) and `actions/setup-node` (between `@v3` and `@v4`).
*   **Testing Status:** In all `test-` and `deploy-` related workflows, the "Test with Jest" step (`npm run test`) remains consistently commented out.
*   **Deployment Logic:** The `deploy-staging.yml` and `deploy-production.yml` share identical deployment logic, differing only in their target branch, environment name, URL, and the specific AWS S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution IDs, which are managed via GitHub secrets.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** All changes occurred within a very narrow window of approximately 10 minutes on the same day, indicating a focused effort to configure or troubleshoot the CI/CD pipelines.

## 3:13:38 PM
The provided log details a series of updates to GitHub Actions workflows and a significant change to a React/TypeScript application file.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-staging-pull-request.yml`**
    *   This workflow, triggered on pull requests to the "ultimate-staging" branch, underwent numerous revisions.
    *   **Node.js Versioning:** Initially configured to use Node.js `16.19.0` (2/6/2026, 1:19:57 PM), it was rapidly updated through several iterations (e.g., `.19.0`, `22`) to finally settle on `22.18.0` (2/6/2026, 1:21:18 PM). The `actions/setup-node` action itself saw changes between `v3` and `v4`.
    *   **Checkout Action Versioning:** The `actions/checkout` version was updated from `v4` to `v4.4.3` (2/6/2026, 1:24:14 PM) and subsequently downgraded to `v3` (2/6/2026, 1:27:35 PM).
    *   The core steps for installing dependencies (`npm ci --force`) and building (`CI=false npm run build`) remained consistent, while the "Test with Jest" step was consistently commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-production-pull-request.yml`**
    *   This workflow, for pull requests to the "ultimate" branch, saw fewer, but similar, updates to its staging counterpart.
    *   **Node.js Versioning:** It was consistently configured for Node.js `22.18.0` using `actions/setup-node@v4` from its initial appearance (2/6/2026, 1:21:52 PM).
    *   **Checkout Action Versioning:** The `actions/checkout` version was updated from `v4` to `v4.4.3` (2/6/2026, 1:24:23 PM) and then downgraded to `v3` (2/6/2026, 1:28:13 PM).
    *   Build steps mirrored the staging workflow, with tests commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-staging.yml`**
    *   This workflow handles deployment to a staging environment (irisnewdev.mikelegal.com) on pushes to "ultimate-staging."
    *   **Node.js Versioning:** Consistently used Node.js `22.18.0` with `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **Checkout Action Versioning:** The `actions/checkout` action was updated from `v4.2.3` (2/6/2026, 1:22:20 PM) to `v4.4.3` (2/6/2026, 1:22:46 PM) and later to `v4.2.2` (2/6/2026, 1:28:43 PM).
    *   The workflow includes steps for building, uploading/downloading artifacts, configuring AWS credentials, syncing `build/` to an S3 bucket, and invalidating a CloudFront distribution, all leveraging secrets for sensitive information.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-production.yml`**
    *   This workflow manages deployment to the production environment (irisnew.mikelegal.com) on pushes to the "ultimate" branch.
    *   **Node.js Versioning:** Initially, the `node-version` was left blank (2/6/2026, 1:23:20 PM) but was quickly corrected to `22.18.0` (2/6/2026, 1:23:28 PM) using `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    *   **Checkout Action Versioning:** The `actions/checkout` action was updated from `v4.4.3` to `v4.2.2` (2/6/2026, 1:29:01 PM).
    *   Its deployment steps closely mirror the staging deployment, but target production AWS resources (`secrets.S3_BUCKET_PRODUCTION`, `secrets.CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_PRODUCTION`).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`**
    *   This file represents a `Hearing` React component (2/6/2026, 2:41:54 PM).
    *   It's a comprehensive page for managing TLA and Opposition hearings, categorized into "unverified" and "verified" tabs.
    *   Key functionalities include displaying hearing data, verifying entries, sending reports, managing location via a dropdown, and supporting CSV uploads and manual row additions through modals.
    *   The component heavily uses Ant Design for its UI, `react-router-dom` for navigation, `react-toastify` for notifications, and Redux Toolkit for state management (fetching data, updating records, dispatching actions like `putVerify`, `sendReport`, `putLocation`, `scanHearing`).
    *   It dynamically links to an admin interface based on hearing type and includes logic for pop-up confirmations before verification, especially if journal and actual counts do not match or processed excel is missing.
    *   Custom styling is applied using `styled-components`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The most significant activity occurred on **2/6/2026**, with a concentrated period of workflow configuration between **1:19:57 PM** and **1:29:01 PM**. This suggests a dedicated session to stabilize and update the CI/CD pipelines. The `Hearing.tsx` file received a substantial update later on the same day at **2:41:54 PM**, indicating active application development following the pipeline adjustments.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **GitHub Actions Standardization:** All `.yml` files are GitHub Actions workflows for a Node.js project. They consistently involve steps for checking out code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies with `npm ci --force`, and building with `CI=false npm run build`.
*   **Node.js Version Target:** There's a clear move to standardize on Node.js `22.18.0` across all workflows.
*   **Action Versioning Fluctuation:** The versions of `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` underwent several iterative changes (e.g., `v4` to `v4.4.3` to `v3` or `v4.2.2`), indicating a process of fine-tuning or troubleshooting GitHub Action versions.
*   **Consistent CI/CD Structure:** The deployment workflows for both staging and production share a common pattern: build, upload artifact, download artifact, configure AWS credentials, sync to S3, and invalidate CloudFront, demonstrating a robust, templated deployment strategy.
*   **Branch-Based Environments:** The use of `ultimate-staging` and `ultimate` branches clearly delineates staging and production environments respectively for both PR testing and deployment.
*   **Unimplemented Test Step:** The "Test with Jest" step is consistently commented out in all PR workflows, suggesting that automated testing via Jest is either not yet integrated into the CI, or is handled out-of-band.
