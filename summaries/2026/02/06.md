# Activity Summary for 2/6/2026

## 2:13:31 PM
The provided log details a series of rapid changes to GitHub Actions workflow files, all occurring on February 6, 2026, between 1:19:57 PM and 1:29:01 PM. These changes primarily involve updating action versions and Node.js configurations across testing and deployment workflows.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-staging-pull-request.yml`**
    *   **Initial State (1:19:57 PM):** Configured to run on `pull_request` to the `ultimate-staging` branch, using Node.js `16.19.0` (`actions/setup-node@v3`) and `actions/checkout@v4`. It installs dependencies (`npm ci --force`) and builds (`CI=false npm run build`), with tests commented out.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (1:20:24 PM - 1:21:27 PM):** The Node.js version was progressively updated from `16.19.0` to `22`, then refined to `22.18.0`. The `actions/setup-node` action was also updated from `@v3` to `@v4` during this period.
    *   **Later Changes (1:24:14 PM - 1:28:01 PM):** The `actions/checkout` version saw several updates and reverts, moving from `@v4` to `@v4.4.3`, then back to `@v3`. Similarly, `actions/setup-node` briefly reverted to `@v3` (1:27:47 PM) before being set back to `@v4` (1:28:01 PM).

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-production-pull-request.yml`**
    *   **Initial State (1:21:52 PM):** This workflow for `pull_request` to the `ultimate` branch mirrored the `test-staging-pull-request.yml`'s final Node.js configuration, using `22.18.0` with `actions/setup-node@v4` and `actions/checkout@v4`. Tests were also commented out.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (1:24:23 PM - 1:28:13 PM):** The `actions/checkout` version was updated from `@v4` to `@v4.4.3` and then reverted to `@v3`.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-staging.yml`**
    *   **Initial State (1:22:20 PM):** This deployment workflow triggers on `push` to `ultimate-staging`. It consists of `build` and `deploy` jobs. The `build` job uses `actions/checkout@v4.2.3`, Node.js `22.18.0` (`actions/setup-node@v4`), builds the project, and uploads artifacts using `actions/upload-artifact@v4.4.3`. The `deploy` job downloads artifacts (`actions/download-artifact@v4.1.8`), configures AWS credentials, syncs built files to an S3 bucket, and invalidates a CloudFront distribution, all using secrets for sensitive information.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (1:22:46 PM - 1:28:43 PM):** The `actions/checkout` version was updated from `@v4.2.3` to `@v4.4.3`, and then later changed to `@v4.2.2`.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\deploy-production.yml`**
    *   **Initial State (1:23:20 PM):** This workflow triggers on `push` to the `ultimate` branch and is structurally identical to the `deploy-staging.yml` file, but targets a production environment URL (`https://irisnew.mikelegal.com/`) and uses production-specific AWS secrets (S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution). Notably, the initial configuration had a blank `node-version`.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (1:23:28 PM - 1:29:01 PM):** The `node-version` was immediately corrected to `22.18.0`. The `actions/checkout` version, initially `@v4.4.3`, was later updated to `@v4.2.2`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Workflow Structure:** All workflows follow a standard pattern for Node.js projects in GitHub Actions: checkout code, set up Node.js, install dependencies (`npm ci --force`), and build the project (`CI=false npm run build`).
*   **Node.js Version Target:** A consistent effort was made to standardize the Node.js version to `22.18.0` across all workflows, with `actions/setup-node@v4` being the preferred action version for this.
*   **Action Version Fluctuations:** There were frequent updates and subsequent reverts or minor adjustments to the versions of GitHub Actions used, particularly `actions/checkout` (cycling through `@v4`, `@v4.4.3`, `@v3`, `@v4.2.2`, `@v4.2.3`) and `actions/setup-node` (between `@v3` and `@v4`).
*   **Testing Status:** In all `test-` and `deploy-` related workflows, the "Test with Jest" step (`npm run test`) remains consistently commented out.
*   **Deployment Logic:** The `deploy-staging.yml` and `deploy-production.yml` share identical deployment logic, differing only in their target branch, environment name, URL, and the specific AWS S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution IDs, which are managed via GitHub secrets.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** All changes occurred within a very narrow window of approximately 10 minutes on the same day, indicating a focused effort to configure or troubleshoot the CI/CD pipelines.
