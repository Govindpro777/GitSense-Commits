`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`

**Summary of Changes:** Across multiple timestamps on 2/7/2026, from 11:47:57 AM to 11:49:40 AM, the provided code snippets for this file are identical and appear to be truncated. No discernible functional changes are evident within the provided log entries for this specific file. The component itself is a React functional component responsible for managing contract documents, including features like search, sorting, pagination, handling file/folder uploads (using S3 signed URLs, with progress tracking and replacement logic for existing files), and file downloads. It integrates with Ant Design components, `axios` for network requests, and custom hooks from `@mike-clm/shared`.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FileManagerGrid.tsx`

**Summary of Changes:** This file underwent a series of focused updates on 2/7/2026, between 2:04:55 PM and 2:15:07 PM, primarily concerning the implementation and refinement of permission-based actions, especially for folder deletion.
*   **Initial Development & Structure (around 2:04 PM - 2:09 PM):** The early entries show the basic structure for displaying files and folders in a grid, including functionality for downloading and deleting individual files, and initiating folder downloads/deletes. A `canDeleteFolder` function is present to check permissions, but its application to UI elements for folders evolved.
*   **Enabling/Disabling Folder Deletion (2:10:32 PM):** Logic was introduced to visually restrict folder deletion. Specifically, the delete button for non-root folders was `disabled` if the `canDeleteFolder` function indicated that deletion was not allowed.
*   **Conditional Rendering for Folder Deletion (2:14:10 PM):** This was refined further. Instead of just disabling the delete button for non-root folders, the button was updated to be conditionally rendered. If `canDeleteThisFolder` is false, the delete button is no longer displayed for non-root folders.
*   **Root Folder Delete Permissions (2:14:58 PM):** The conditional rendering logic for the delete button, based on `canDeleteThisFolder`, was extended to also apply to root folders. This ensures a consistent permission-driven user experience across all folder levels, where the delete action is only visible if permissible.
*   **Intermittent Logic Bugs & Fixes:** Several entries (e.g., 2:10:42 PM, 2:12:15 PM, 2:14:35 PM) show brief inversions or incorrect initializations of the `canDeleteFolder` logic, which were quickly corrected in subsequent commits. This indicates a rapid cycle of development, testing, and debugging as the permission logic was being solidified.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Focus on Permission Enforcement:** A clear and recurring theme in `FileManagerGrid.tsx` is the iterative enhancement of access control for actions like deleting files and folders, particularly by integrating the `canDeleteFolder` function with the UI.
*   **Rapid Development and Debugging:** The frequent, small changes and quick reversions (especially concerning the `canDeleteFolder` logic and its application to UI button states) suggest an active and rapid development process, possibly involving live testing or immediate feedback loops.
*   **Consistent File Types:** All logged changes are within React TypeScript components (`.tsx`) that handle UI and logic for file management within a frontend application.
*   **Incomplete Log Entries:** The `Files.tsx` log consistently provides partial code, indicating a potential issue with the log capture mechanism for that specific file over that period.

## 2:20:06 PM
The provided code change log primarily details updates across three main areas: a workflow management page, SVG icon definitions, and a complex chatbot component.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\Workflow.jsx`** (Timestamp: 2/6/2026, 5:40:13 PM): This file appears to be a major commit or initial implementation of a "Workflow" management page. It's a React component leveraging Ant Design for UI elements like modals, spinners, and typography. It provides functionality to create, view, edit, and delete document comparison workflows (presets). Key features include displaying workflows as cards, a button to create new workflows, a "Show Example" function populating a sample workflow, and confirmation modals for deletion.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\assets\docchat\ThreeDotOutlined.jsx`** (Timestamps: 2/7/2026, 5:29:37 PM & 2/7/2026, 5:29:44 PM): This file defines a React component for a three-dot SVG icon. The primary change between the two timestamps is the addition of a `fill="#000000"` attribute to the SVG path, explicitly setting the icon's color to black.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\assets\docchat\ClearBrushOutlined.jsx`** (Timestamps: 2/7/2026, 6:16:00 PM, 2/7/2026, 6:16:09 PM, & 2/7/2026, 6:16:26 PM): This file defines a React component for a "Clear Brush" SVG icon. The initial version has `viewBox="0 0 214"` and `width="20" height="20"`. The subsequent changes (within seconds) adjust the `viewBox` attribute to `0 0 20 20` and later to `0 0 14 14`, and simultaneously update the `width` and `height` attributes to match the `viewBox` for consistent sizing, while the fill color remains `#25314C`.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\assets\docchat\ClearBrushOutlinedRed.jsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 2/8/2026, 11:59:26 AM and 2/8/2026, 12:00:40 PM): This file introduces a new React component for a "Clear Brush" SVG icon, similar to `ClearBrushOutlined.jsx`, but with its path `fill` attribute explicitly set to `"#DC3545"` (red). A minor change at 2/8/2026, 12:00:40 PM removes the explicit `import React from 'react'` statement, a common optimization in modern React.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\Chatbot\index.jsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 2/7/2026, 5:41:24 PM and 2/8/2026, 1:25:31 PM): This is a central and highly active file.
    *   The most notable change is the introduction of `import ClearBrushOutlinedRed from '../../assets/docchat/ClearBrushOutlinedRed';` on 2/8/2026, 12:01:12 PM, indicating that the new red clear brush icon is being integrated into the chatbot component.
    *   Apart from this specific import addition, the content of this file is *identical* across all other listed timestamps, suggesting frequent saves or commits without functional changes during those intervals.
    *   The file defines a comprehensive chatbot interface, including real-time messaging via WebSockets, chat history display, user input handling, feedback mechanisms (like/dislike with tags), and document export functionality. It manages UI state, user interactions, and integrates with Redux for data management. It also supports "Chat" and "Workflow" (presets) tabs, with a "processing" badge on the "Workflow" tab.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\Chatbot\_chatbot.scss`** (Timestamp: 2/8/2026, 1:24:04 PM): This SCSS file provides extensive styling for the chatbot interface. It covers layout, message formatting (including blockquotes, lists, headings), user and bot message distinct styling, a loading animation for bot responses, and visual feedback for action icons (copy, like, dislike) with hover and selected states. It also includes styling for feedback input, scrollbars, and an empty state display.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **2/6/2026, 5:40:13 PM**: Introduction/major update to the workflow management page (`Workflow.jsx`).
*   **2/7/2026, 5:29:44 PM**: Refinement of the `ThreeDotOutlined.jsx` SVG icon to have a black fill.
*   **2/7/2026, 6:16:26 PM**: Refinement of the `ClearBrushOutlined.jsx` SVG icon's dimensions.
*   **2/8/2026, 12:00:40 PM**: Minor code style improvement in `ClearBrushOutlinedRed.jsx` by removing redundant React import.
*   **2/8/2026, 12:01:12 PM**: Integration of the new red clear brush icon (`ClearBrushOutlinedRed.jsx`) into the main `Chatbot/index.jsx` component.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **React and Ant Design**: The codebase heavily uses React for component-based UI development and Ant Design for a consistent and rich UI library.
*   **SVG Icons**: There's a pattern of defining individual SVG icons as React functional components within the `src\assets\docchat\` directory, often followed by rapid adjustments to their `fill` attribute or `viewBox`/`dimensions`.
*   **Chatbot Functionality**: The chatbot (`Chatbot/index.jsx`) is a central feature, integrating real-time communication, Redux state management, user feedback, and document-related actions like export and preset application.
*   **Workflow/Preset Integration**: Workflows (presets) are a key concept, managed in a dedicated settings page and applied within the chatbot interface.
*   **Rapid Iteration/Saves**: Multiple identical log entries for `Chatbot/index.jsx` within short timeframes (seconds to minutes) suggest either frequent saving during development or automated commit/staging processes.
*   **No sensitive data**: No files containing environment variables or keys were found in the provided log.
