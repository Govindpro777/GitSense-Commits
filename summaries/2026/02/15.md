# Activity Summary for 2/15/2026

## 1:44:21 PM
The changes primarily focus on refining trademark filtering mechanisms within the `IPSuite-Web` application, specifically around "Active" and "In-Active" status filters.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\managerActions\trademarkDashboard\actions.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:31:40 PM to 2/13/2026, 5:51:19 PM.
    *   **Updates:** No significant code changes were introduced or removed in the provided logs for this file. The `getReplyToCorrespondence` function remains commented out throughout all timestamps, indicating it's either disabled, under development, or temporarily removed from active use. Existing functions like `getTmRenewals` and `renewalFiled` remain unchanged.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\managerConstants\trademarkConstants.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:32:54 PM to 2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM.
    *   **Updates:** The `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` constant underwent a renaming refactor:
        *   At **2/13/2026, 5:45:39 PM**, `filter_active_status` was renamed to `active_flag`.
        *   At **2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM**, `filter_inactive_status` was renamed to `inactive_flag`.
        *   The purpose of these flags is to control the "Active" and "In-Active" filtering states for trademarks.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:34:18 PM to 2/15/2026, 12:16:25 PM.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   At **2/13/2026, 5:45:15 PM**, the `applyFilter` function was updated to include conditions for `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` when determining if any filters are applied.
        *   Between **2/13/2026, 5:45:15 PM** and **2/13/2026, 5:50:22 PM**, the `applyFilter` function was further refined. The variable names for active/inactive filters were updated to `active_flag` and `inactive_flag` to match the changes in `trademarkConstants.js`. A minor syntax error (`|| filter_inactive_statu`) was also corrected.
        *   Subsequent logs for this file (up to **2/15/2026, 12:16:25 PM**) show consistent content with these applied changes, indicating no further functional modifications in the provided snippets.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\FilterComponents\FilterSearchBasic.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:35:16 PM to 2/15/2026, 11:49:39 AM.
    *   **Updates:** This file underwent a significant activation and refinement:
        *   At **2/13/2026, 4:35:22 PM**, the entire file was uncommented, reactivating the `FilterSearchBasic` component.
        *   At **2/13/2026, 4:36:34 PM**, new UI elements (checkboxes) for "Active" and "In-Active" status filtering were added within the `trademarkStatus` filter section. This involved adding `getFilterValue`, `isActive`, and `isInactive` state variables.
        *   Between **2/13/2026, 4:36:49 PM** and **2/13/2026, 5:50:07 PM**, the filter key names used in this component's logic were updated to `active_flag` and `inactive_flag` (from `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status`), aligning with the changes in `trademarkConstants.js`. The `onChange` handlers for the checkboxes were also adjusted to use these new key names consistently.
        *   At **2/15/2026, 11:46:39 AM**, the `getFilterValue` helper function was enhanced to correctly retrieve filter values, potentially from a nested structure, based on a `switchValue` prop.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Trademark Status Filtering:** A clear recurring theme is the implementation and refinement of "Active" and "In-Active" trademark status filters across constants and UI components. This involves defining the filter flags, updating filter application logic, and creating interactive checkboxes.
*   **Refactoring for Consistency:** The renaming of `filter_active_status` to `active_flag` and `filter_inactive_status` to `inactive_flag` across multiple files (`trademarkConstants.js`, `TotalTrademark.jsx`, `FilterSearchBasic.jsx`) indicates a concerted effort to standardize naming conventions.
*   **Redux/State Management Integration:** The changes in `TotalTrademark.jsx` and `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` demonstrate how UI components interact with a global state (presumably Redux, given the `actions.js` file) to manage and apply filters, including the use of `switchValue` for different data contexts (e.g., `ip_india` vs `pseudo`).
*   **Gradual Feature Implementation:** The initial commented-out state of `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` followed by its full uncommenting and subsequent enhancements suggests a phased approach to feature development and deployment.

## 3:08:08 PM
The provided log details code changes across three primary files related to a Trademark management feature:

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\managerActions\trademarkDashboard\actions.js`**
*   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 2/13/2026, 4:31:40 PM to 2/15/2026, 2:22:57 PM.
*   **Updates:** This file consistently defines Redux actions for the manager's trademark dashboard, including `getTmRenewals` and `renewalFiled`. These actions interact with a backend API (`MGR_RT_URL/trademarks/renewals/`) using `Axios` and manage `LOADING`, `SUCCESS`, and `ERROR` states, including a common authorization check. A significant `getReplyToCorrespondence` function remains commented out across all log entries for this file, indicating it's either deprecated or under development but not actively used. No functional code changes were introduced or removed in the provided log entries for this specific file; all content snapshots are identical.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\managerConstants\trademarkConstants.js`**
*   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:32:54 PM, 2/13/2026, 5:45:39 PM, 2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM.
*   **Updates:** This file, which defines default filter and search configurations for trademarks, underwent refactoring in its filter property names.
    *   Around 2/13/2026, 5:45:39 PM, the filter property `filter_active_status` within `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` was renamed to `active_flag`.
    *   Shortly after, at 2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM, `filter_inactive_status` was similarly renamed to `inactive_flag`.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**
*   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 2/13/2026, 4:34:18 PM to 2/15/2026, 11:59:51 AM.
*   **Updates:** This React class component, responsible for the main "Total Trademark" view, received updates to align with the filter constant changes.
    *   Initially, the `applyFilter` method used `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` for filtering logic (around 2/13/2026, 4:34:18 PM).
    *   Between 2/13/2026, 5:45:15 PM and 2/13/2026, 5:50:22 PM, the `applyFilter` method was updated to destructure and utilize the new `active_flag` and `inactive_flag` properties from its `selectedFilters` state, replacing the older names. There was a temporary syntax error (`|| || filter_inactive_statu`) introduced during this transition which was quickly corrected.
    *   The `filterKeys` array also includes "CLIENTS", indicating client-based filtering was incorporated.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\FilterComponents\FilterSearchBasic.jsx`**
*   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries from 2/13/2026, 4:35:16 PM to 2/15/2026, 11:49:39 AM.
*   **Updates:** This reusable `FilterSearchBasic` React functional component saw significant changes:
    *   Initially, the entire component was commented out (between 2/13/2026, 4:35:16 PM and 2/13/2026, 4:36:26 PM).
    *   It was then uncommented (2/13/2026, 4:36:34 PM) and enhanced to include "Active" and "In-Active" checkboxes specifically for `trademarkStatus` filters. This new filter section included "deadlock protection" logic to prevent both active and inactive from being simultaneously selected or deselected if one is already exclusively active.
    *   Subsequently, the filter key names used internally for checking active/inactive status were updated from `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` to `active_flag` and `inactive_flag` respectively (between 2/13/2026, 5:44:50 PM and 2/13/2026, 5:50:07 PM).
    *   A significant logic improvement was introduced around 2/15/2026, 11:46:39 AM, where the `getFilterValue` function was modified to dynamically check for filter values either directly from `selectedFilters` or from a nested `selectedFilters[switchValue]` object, catering to scenarios where filters might be specific to different data views (e.g., "pseudo" vs. "ip_india").

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Refactoring Filter Names:** A consistent pattern of renaming `filter_active_status` to `active_flag` and `filter_inactive_status` to `inactive_flag` is observed across both the constants file (`trademarkConstants.js`) and the components that utilize these filters (`TotalTrademark.jsx`, `FilterSearchBasic.jsx`). This suggests a broader effort to standardize naming conventions for filter properties.
*   **Ant Design Usage:** All component files heavily rely on Ant Design for UI elements, including `Menu`, `Input.Search`, `Checkbox`, `Typography.Text`, `Button`, `message`, `Table`, `Switch`, etc., indicating a consistent design system.
*   **Redux for State Management:** The application uses Redux actions to manage data fetching and state updates, with actions typically having `LOADING`, `SUCCESS`, and `ERROR` statuses.
*   **Modular Component Design:** The `FilterSearchBasic` component highlights a modular approach, being a common component designed for reuse across different filter types.
*   **Authentication Handling:** API calls consistently include an `Authorization` header using a token from `localStorage` and implement a `checkAuthorisation` utility for error handling, suggesting a standardized authentication flow.
*   **Client-side Filtering:** The presence of `trademarkClients` in filter definitions and `CLIENTS` in filter configurations points to an enhancement allowing filtering based on client associations.
