# Activity Summary for 2/15/2026

## 1:44:21 PM
The changes primarily focus on refining trademark filtering mechanisms within the `IPSuite-Web` application, specifically around "Active" and "In-Active" status filters.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\managerActions\trademarkDashboard\actions.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:31:40 PM to 2/13/2026, 5:51:19 PM.
    *   **Updates:** No significant code changes were introduced or removed in the provided logs for this file. The `getReplyToCorrespondence` function remains commented out throughout all timestamps, indicating it's either disabled, under development, or temporarily removed from active use. Existing functions like `getTmRenewals` and `renewalFiled` remain unchanged.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\managerConstants\trademarkConstants.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:32:54 PM to 2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM.
    *   **Updates:** The `TM_DefaultSelectedFilters` constant underwent a renaming refactor:
        *   At **2/13/2026, 5:45:39 PM**, `filter_active_status` was renamed to `active_flag`.
        *   At **2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM**, `filter_inactive_status` was renamed to `inactive_flag`.
        *   The purpose of these flags is to control the "Active" and "In-Active" filtering states for trademarks.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:34:18 PM to 2/15/2026, 12:16:25 PM.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   At **2/13/2026, 5:45:15 PM**, the `applyFilter` function was updated to include conditions for `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status` when determining if any filters are applied.
        *   Between **2/13/2026, 5:45:15 PM** and **2/13/2026, 5:50:22 PM**, the `applyFilter` function was further refined. The variable names for active/inactive filters were updated to `active_flag` and `inactive_flag` to match the changes in `trademarkConstants.js`. A minor syntax error (`|| filter_inactive_statu`) was also corrected.
        *   Subsequent logs for this file (up to **2/15/2026, 12:16:25 PM**) show consistent content with these applied changes, indicating no further functional modifications in the provided snippets.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\FilterComponents\FilterSearchBasic.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 2/13/2026, 4:35:16 PM to 2/15/2026, 11:49:39 AM.
    *   **Updates:** This file underwent a significant activation and refinement:
        *   At **2/13/2026, 4:35:22 PM**, the entire file was uncommented, reactivating the `FilterSearchBasic` component.
        *   At **2/13/2026, 4:36:34 PM**, new UI elements (checkboxes) for "Active" and "In-Active" status filtering were added within the `trademarkStatus` filter section. This involved adding `getFilterValue`, `isActive`, and `isInactive` state variables.
        *   Between **2/13/2026, 4:36:49 PM** and **2/13/2026, 5:50:07 PM**, the filter key names used in this component's logic were updated to `active_flag` and `inactive_flag` (from `filter_active_status` and `filter_inactive_status`), aligning with the changes in `trademarkConstants.js`. The `onChange` handlers for the checkboxes were also adjusted to use these new key names consistently.
        *   At **2/15/2026, 11:46:39 AM**, the `getFilterValue` helper function was enhanced to correctly retrieve filter values, potentially from a nested structure, based on a `switchValue` prop.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Trademark Status Filtering:** A clear recurring theme is the implementation and refinement of "Active" and "In-Active" trademark status filters across constants and UI components. This involves defining the filter flags, updating filter application logic, and creating interactive checkboxes.
*   **Refactoring for Consistency:** The renaming of `filter_active_status` to `active_flag` and `filter_inactive_status` to `inactive_flag` across multiple files (`trademarkConstants.js`, `TotalTrademark.jsx`, `FilterSearchBasic.jsx`) indicates a concerted effort to standardize naming conventions.
*   **Redux/State Management Integration:** The changes in `TotalTrademark.jsx` and `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` demonstrate how UI components interact with a global state (presumably Redux, given the `actions.js` file) to manage and apply filters, including the use of `switchValue` for different data contexts (e.g., `ip_india` vs `pseudo`).
*   **Gradual Feature Implementation:** The initial commented-out state of `FilterSearchBasic.jsx` followed by its full uncommenting and subsequent enhancements suggests a phased approach to feature development and deployment.
