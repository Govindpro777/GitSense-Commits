# Activity Summary for 2/13/2026

## 2:26:49 PM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing and refining search functionalities across several components and Redux actions within the `IPSuite-Web` application. All modifications occurred on February 13, 2026, indicating a concentrated development effort.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\searchActions\commonActions.js`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 2/13/2026, 11:17:41 AM (and identical content at 11:18:56 AM).
    *   **Updates**: This file defines core Redux actions for various search operations.
        *   **Imports**: Expanded imports to include `GET_SRCH_USER_TMS` for types, `mikeAxios`, `sampleData`, and `default_filter_page_size`.
        *   **`getUserTrademarks()` and `getUserTrademarksInSearch()`**: Functions for fetching user trademarks were detailed, including handling API responses (200/201), displaying search quota notifications, and dispatching Redux actions with `LOADING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR` statuses. They consistently use `localStorage.getItem("token")` for authorization and `checkAuthorisation` for error handling.
        *   **`postUserTrademark()`**: Implemented for posting new user trademarks, with similar success/error handling and specific error responses for `400` status.
        *   **`fetchSearchAnalysisNew()`**: Introduced for fetching search analysis, utilizing `Axios.CancelToken` for request cancellation and dispatching status updates. It includes parameters like `operation`, `flash_flag`, `required_filter`, `page`, `page_size`, and `search_log_ids`/`search_log_id`.
        *   **`getSearchResults()`**: This function processes search parameters, dispatches loading states, and makes a `mikeAxios.put` call with a `cancelToken` to retrieve search results.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Search.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 2/13/2026, 11:23:45 AM (and identical content at 11:26:02 AM).
    *   **Updates**: This is a main container component for search functionalities.
        *   **Extensive Imports**: Added numerous Ant Design components, `lodash` utilities (`debounce`, `each`), `Axios`, `introJs`, `Sentry`, `Lottie`, `Tour`, and various IP-Suite specific components and Redux actions/types.
        *   **State Management**: Introduced new state variables like `isTourOpen`, `reportExplicitTrigger1/2`, `visibleStep`, `modalsVisibility` (including `imageRecognition: true`), `selectedFilters` (including `imageSearch: null`), `imageSearch` object, and `isWelcomeOpen`.
        *   **Lifecycle Methods (`componentDidMount`)**: Implemented logic to check for user subscriptions, dynamically populate search type options (`Trademarks`, `Application`, `G&S`, `Proprietors`, `Image_Search`), fetch user profile and alerts, and handle a new "Welcome Modal" for first-time users (tracking in `localStorage`). Sentry tags for `userName` and `userEmail` are set.
        *   **`searchAlgos()`**: A complex function for managing multiple trademark search algorithms (e.g., "Flash", "Boolean", "Initials", "Fuzzy", "Wildcard"). It generates `Axios.CancelToken` for each algorithm, dispatches cancellation tokens, and calls `getSearchResults` with algorithm-specific parameters and refresh logic.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\TrademarksSearch.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 2/13/2026, 11:25:03 AM through 1:25:32 PM (many identical entries).
    *   **Updates**: This component is responsible for displaying trademark search results and related filters.
        *   **New Imports**: Integrated filter-related components like `SearchFilterSearchBasic`, `SelectContainer`, `DateFilterContainer`, `NewResultsAnalysis`, `HighlightPrefix`, and `HighlightSuffix`.
        *   **Redux Actions**: Added actions for managing search filters (`getSearchAllFilters`, `resetAllSearchFilter`, `updateTrademarkSearchFilterApplied`, `changeSearchDashboardSearchType`, `changeSearchDashboardSearchValue`).
        *   **State and Handlers**: Initialized with `TS_trademarksSearchState` and added local state for date ranges and search queries (`wildcardSearch`, `booleanSearch`).
        *   **`handleGetSingleFilter()`**: Fetches specific filter data for search, considering `flash_flag` and `search_log_ids`.
        *   **`searchAlgos()`**: Similar to the `Search.jsx` version, this function orchestrates fetching search results across various algorithms, generating and managing `Axios.CancelToken` for each. It also includes specific handling for `fuzzy_depth` in "Prefix" and "Suffix" searches and refresh logic.
        *   **Recurring identical entries** indicate frequent saves or minor non-functional changes during this period.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\ImageSearch.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 2/13/2026, 11:26:14 AM (and identical content at 11:29:12 AM, 11:30:26 AM).
    *   **Updates**: Dedicated component for image search functionality.
        *   **Specific Imports**: `Icon` from `@ant-design/compatible` and `getImageSearchResults` action.
        *   **Initialization**: Sets the search path to `/search/image_search` on component mount.
        *   **`handleFilters()`**: Manages applying and resetting filters specific to image search, calling `getImageSearchResults`.
        *   **`handleConfirmReport()`**: Implemented report generation for image search, including parameters for `report_source`, `report_type`, `report_file_types`, and `image_search` specific details like `selected` applications IDs and `search_log_id`.
        *   **`handleGetFilters()`**: Fetches image search-specific filter options from the API.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\filterContainer\SelectContainer.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 2/13/2026, 12:13:05 PM through 12:58:10 PM (many identical entries, with a few functional changes).
    *   **Updates**: This functional component provides a reusable pattern for filters with selection and exclusion.
        *   **Initial Implementation (12:13:05 PM)**: Defined handlers for `handleChange` (updating selected values), `handleSearchDebounced` (debounced fetching of filter data based on input), `handleScroll` (implementing infinite scroll for filter options), and `handleExcludeButton` (managing excluded items). Introduced `extraChildrenForStatusFilter` to render "Active"/"In-Active" checkboxes for `SEARCH_STATUS`.
        *   **Checkbox `disabled` logic adjustment (12:22:56 PM)**: Modified the `disabled` attribute for "Active" and "In-Active" checkboxes to use `!!filteredData?.inActiveStatus` and `!!filteredData?.activeStatus` respectively, making the mutual exclusion logic more explicit.
        *   **Checkbox `disabled` removal (12:49:01 PM)**: The `disabled` attributes for both "Active" and "In-Active" checkboxes in `extraChildrenForStatusFilter` were commented out, making them always enabled regardless of the other's state.
        *   **Recurring identical entries** for this file suggest continuous saving during development.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Redux-centric Architecture**: All changes consistently use Redux for managing application state, dispatching actions for data fetching, loading states, and error handling.
*   **API Interaction with Axios**: `Axios` is the primary library for making HTTP requests to the backend (`SRCH_RT_URL`), with `localStorage.getItem("token")` for authorization headers.
*   **Error Handling and Notifications**: A common pattern of using `notification["error"]` from `antd` and `checkAuthorisation` (in actions) is present for user feedback on API failures.
*   **Performance Optimization**: `lodash.debounce` is widely used across multiple components (`Search.jsx`, `TrademarksSearch.jsx`, `SelectContainer.jsx`) to prevent excessive function calls, particularly for search inputs and filter fetching.
*   **Axios Cancellation Tokens**: For complex search operations involving multiple algorithms, `Axios.CancelToken` is leveraged to manage and cancel ongoing HTTP requests, improving responsiveness.
*   **UI Framework (Ant Design)**: The application's UI heavily relies on Ant Design components, imported and utilized consistently across components.
*   **Modularization**: Search-related logic is organized into Redux actions and specialized React components and containers (e.g., `Search.jsx`, `TrademarksSearch.jsx`, `ImageSearch.jsx`, `SelectContainer.jsx`), demonstrating a modular approach.
*   **Frequent Saves**: The high number of identical timestamped entries for `TrademarksSearch.jsx` and `SelectContainer.jsx` suggests frequent file saves without significant functional code changes in between, common during active development or debugging.
