# Activity Summary for 2/2/2026

## 1:57:11 PM
The provided log details changes primarily within a React project named "iris-web", focusing on its initial setup or migration to a Vite-based environment. All recorded changes occurred on 2/2/2026, indicating a concentrated period of development or configuration.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\package.json`**:
    *   Observed between 12:26:36 PM and 12:30:00 PM, this file remained consistent across its logged states. It defines the project as "iris-web" (version 0.1.0) and lists a comprehensive set of dependencies, including `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `antd`, `axios`, `lodash`, `moment`, `react` (v17.0.2), `react-dom` (v17.0.2), `react-router-dom` (v6.30.3), `styled-components`, and `typescript` (v4.6.2). Development dependencies prominently feature Vite (v7.3.1), `@vitejs/plugin-react` (v5.1.2), ESLint (with Airbnb config, Node, Prettier plugins), and Prettier. The `scripts` section confirms the use of `vite` for `dev`, `build`, and `preview` commands.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\index.tsx`**:
    *   At 12:28:52 PM, this file underwent a significant update, shifting from a commented-out `ReactDOM.render` (older React API) to the `ReactDOM.createRoot` API introduced in React 18. This change indicates an upgrade or direct implementation using React 18's concurrent rendering features. The application's entry point is set up to render the main `App` component, wrapped in `React.StrictMode`, `BrowserRouter` for routing, and `Provider` for Redux state management. No further changes were logged for this file at 1:06:12 PM.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\main.tsx`**:
    *   At 12:30:30 PM, this file was updated or introduced with content identical to the React 18 `createRoot` setup seen in `src\index.tsx`. This suggests it might have been an alternative entry point or a temporary copy.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\vite.config.js`**:
    *   Created or updated at 12:42:33 PM, this file provides a minimal Vite configuration, importing `defineConfig` from `vite` and `react` from `@vitejs/plugin-react`, and enabling the React plugin. This confirms the project's use of Vite for its build process.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\public\index.html`**:
    *   This file experienced frequent modifications throughout the log.
    *   Initially (1:09:04 PM), it was a verbose HTML template, typical of Create React App, including numerous meta tags, `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholders, and extensive comments.
    *   A major simplification occurred at 1:12:01 PM, removing most boilerplate and relocating the `<script type="module">` tag to the `<body>`.
    *   However, this simplified version was largely reverted by 1:14:52 PM, bringing back the CRA-style boilerplate, meta tags, and comments.
    *   Subsequent minor adjustments at 1:16:14 PM and 1:16:26 PM involved removing the `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefixes from static asset links (e.g., `favicon.ico`, `logo192.png`, `manifest.json`), indicating a shift to direct referencing within the `public` folder.
    *   A brief change at 1:52:42 PM switched the script source from `/src/index.tsx` to `/src/index.jsx`, but this was quickly reverted back to `/src/index.tsx` by 1:53:49 PM.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vite Migration/Setup:** The changes across `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `src\index.tsx`, and `public\index.html` strongly suggest a process of either migrating an existing Create React App project to Vite or setting up a new Vite project using an older CRA template as a base. The `package.json` already lists Vite, and `vite.config.js` is present.
*   **React 18 Adoption:** The updates to `src\index.tsx` (and `src\main.tsx`) explicitly moving to `ReactDOM.createRoot` indicate an adoption of React 18's new rendering architecture.
*   **Configuration Debugging:** The rapid and sometimes reverting changes in `public\index.html` (simplification then reversion, `public_url` removal, `.tsx` vs `.jsx` toggling) point to an active debugging or fine-tuning phase of the project's build and asset management configuration within the Vite environment.
*   **Consistent Tech Stack:** The project consistently leverages React, Redux, React Router, TypeScript, Styled Components, and Ant Design.
*   **Single Session:** All timestamps fall on the same day (2/2/2026), suggesting all these changes were part of a single, continuous work session.
