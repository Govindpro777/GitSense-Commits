# Activity Summary for 2/2/2026

## 1:57:11 PM
The provided log details changes primarily within a React project named "iris-web", focusing on its initial setup or migration to a Vite-based environment. All recorded changes occurred on 2/2/2026, indicating a concentrated period of development or configuration.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\package.json`**:
    *   Observed between 12:26:36 PM and 12:30:00 PM, this file remained consistent across its logged states. It defines the project as "iris-web" (version 0.1.0) and lists a comprehensive set of dependencies, including `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `antd`, `axios`, `lodash`, `moment`, `react` (v17.0.2), `react-dom` (v17.0.2), `react-router-dom` (v6.30.3), `styled-components`, and `typescript` (v4.6.2). Development dependencies prominently feature Vite (v7.3.1), `@vitejs/plugin-react` (v5.1.2), ESLint (with Airbnb config, Node, Prettier plugins), and Prettier. The `scripts` section confirms the use of `vite` for `dev`, `build`, and `preview` commands.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\index.tsx`**:
    *   At 12:28:52 PM, this file underwent a significant update, shifting from a commented-out `ReactDOM.render` (older React API) to the `ReactDOM.createRoot` API introduced in React 18. This change indicates an upgrade or direct implementation using React 18's concurrent rendering features. The application's entry point is set up to render the main `App` component, wrapped in `React.StrictMode`, `BrowserRouter` for routing, and `Provider` for Redux state management. No further changes were logged for this file at 1:06:12 PM.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\main.tsx`**:
    *   At 12:30:30 PM, this file was updated or introduced with content identical to the React 18 `createRoot` setup seen in `src\index.tsx`. This suggests it might have been an alternative entry point or a temporary copy.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\vite.config.js`**:
    *   Created or updated at 12:42:33 PM, this file provides a minimal Vite configuration, importing `defineConfig` from `vite` and `react` from `@vitejs/plugin-react`, and enabling the React plugin. This confirms the project's use of Vite for its build process.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\public\index.html`**:
    *   This file experienced frequent modifications throughout the log.
    *   Initially (1:09:04 PM), it was a verbose HTML template, typical of Create React App, including numerous meta tags, `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholders, and extensive comments.
    *   A major simplification occurred at 1:12:01 PM, removing most boilerplate and relocating the `<script type="module">` tag to the `<body>`.
    *   However, this simplified version was largely reverted by 1:14:52 PM, bringing back the CRA-style boilerplate, meta tags, and comments.
    *   Subsequent minor adjustments at 1:16:14 PM and 1:16:26 PM involved removing the `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefixes from static asset links (e.g., `favicon.ico`, `logo192.png`, `manifest.json`), indicating a shift to direct referencing within the `public` folder.
    *   A brief change at 1:52:42 PM switched the script source from `/src/index.tsx` to `/src/index.jsx`, but this was quickly reverted back to `/src/index.tsx` by 1:53:49 PM.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vite Migration/Setup:** The changes across `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `src\index.tsx`, and `public\index.html` strongly suggest a process of either migrating an existing Create React App project to Vite or setting up a new Vite project using an older CRA template as a base. The `package.json` already lists Vite, and `vite.config.js` is present.
*   **React 18 Adoption:** The updates to `src\index.tsx` (and `src\main.tsx`) explicitly moving to `ReactDOM.createRoot` indicate an adoption of React 18's new rendering architecture.
*   **Configuration Debugging:** The rapid and sometimes reverting changes in `public\index.html` (simplification then reversion, `public_url` removal, `.tsx` vs `.jsx` toggling) point to an active debugging or fine-tuning phase of the project's build and asset management configuration within the Vite environment.
*   **Consistent Tech Stack:** The project consistently leverages React, Redux, React Router, TypeScript, Styled Components, and Ant Design.
*   **Single Session:** All timestamps fall on the same day (2/2/2026), suggesting all these changes were part of a single, continuous work session.

## 3:43:59 PM
The provided log details a series of changes across several configuration and source code files, primarily focusing on frontend development with React, Redux, Ant Design, and a migration to Vite.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx` (between 2/2/2026, 2:43:35 PM and 3:18:19 PM):**
    *   There were multiple toggles in how SVG icons (`IconMenu`, `UploadIcon`) were imported, alternating between `*.svg` and `*.svg?react` suffixes. This suggests an ongoing adjustment or troubleshooting related to SVG handling (likely with `vite-plugin-svgr`).
    *   The import of `UploadImageText` was removed on 2/2/2026, 3:18:19 PM, indicating a potential removal or refactoring of this component from the Hearing page.
    *   A brief change on 2/2/2026, 2:50:22 PM commented out the `UploadIcon` from a button in the "Actions" column, which was then uncommented almost immediately.
    *   The dynamic title of the page was finalized to display either "Hearings (TLA)" or "Hearings (Opposition)" based on the `root` state, along with the addition of a button.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\tsconfig.json` (between 2/2/2026, 2:46:17 PM and 2:46:26 PM):**
    *   The `compilerOptions` were updated to include `types: ["vite/client", "vite-plugin-svgr/client"]`. This explicitly adds type definitions for Vite and its SVGR plugin, enhancing TypeScript support for these tools.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\vite-env.d.ts` (at 2/2/2026, 2:51:58 PM):**
    *   A reference directive `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` was added, which is standard for providing Vite-specific client-side types.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\package.json` (at 2/2/2026, 2:52:31 PM):**
    *   New dependencies `vite-plugin-svgr` and `vite-tsconfig-paths` were added, confirming the integration of these Vite plugins.
    *   Various `@types` packages (e.g., `@types/node`, `@types/react`) and core packages (`react-router-dom`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`) were updated to newer versions.
    *   The `scripts` section was reconfigured to use `vite` commands (`dev`, `build`, `preview`), indicating a full transition to Vite as the build tool.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\vite.config.js` (between 2/2/2026, 2:53:04 PM and 2:55:17 PM):**
    *   The Vite configuration was refined to include `react()`, `viteTsconfigPaths()`, and `svgr({ include: '**/*.svg?react' })` plugins.
    *   An initial commented-out section for path aliases was present, then restored on 2/2/2026, 2:53:48 PM, introducing a `resolve.alias` for `@` pointing to the `src` directory. This commented-out section was cleaned up on 2/2/2026, 2:53:59 PM.
    *   A `build` configuration was added to specify `outDir: 'build'` on 2/2/2026, 2:55:17 PM.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\src\index.tsx` (between 2/2/2026, 3:04:11 PM and 3:17:32 PM):**
    *   Minor reordering of import statements occurred initially.
    *   `reportWebVitals` was imported and called (2/2/2026, 3:11:45 PM - 3:12:01 PM), along with associated comments.
    *   A brief attempt was made to migrate to React 18's `createRoot` API (2/2/2026, 3:15:51 PM - 3:16:41 PM), importing `createRoot` and updating the rendering method. However, this change was reverted shortly after (2/2/2026, 3:17:32 PM), returning to the `ReactDOM.render` approach.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\iris-new\.github\workflows\test-staging-pull-request.yml` (between 2/2/2026, 3:40:59 PM and 3:41:40 PM):**
    *   The GitHub Actions workflow for staging pull requests was updated.
    *   The `actions/setup-node` action was upgraded from `v3` to `v4`.
    *   The Node.js version used for the build environment was updated from `16.19.0` to `20`.
    *   The step name reflecting the Node.js version was also updated accordingly.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vite Migration and Configuration:** A strong pattern indicates a significant project migration or setup involving Vite. This includes adding Vite plugins (`vite-plugin-svgr`, `vite-tsconfig-paths`), updating `package.json` scripts to use Vite, and configuring `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.js` for proper integration.
*   **SVG Import Adjustments:** The repeated changes to SVG import syntax in `Hearing.tsx` suggest ongoing configuration or troubleshooting of the `vite-plugin-svgr` setup to correctly handle SVGs as React components.
*   **React 18 Migration Attempt:** The `index.tsx` file shows an attempt and subsequent revert of migrating to React 18's new `createRoot` API, indicating either an incomplete migration or a decision to postpone it.
*   **CI Environment Updates:** The GitHub Actions workflow reflects an update to the CI environment, specifically moving to a newer Node.js version (v20), which aligns with modernizing the development stack.
