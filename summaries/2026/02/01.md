All changes occurred on January 31, 2026, with a few final updates spilling over into February 1, 2026.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`.prettierrc.json`**:
    *   Initial configuration was set at **1/31/2026, 12:01:30 PM**, enforcing semicolons, single quotes, ES5 trailing commas, an 80-character print width, 2-space tabs, and auto end-of-line.
    *   The `singleQuote` setting was changed from `true` to `false` at **1/31/2026, 2:40:57 PM**, and then remained `false` in a subsequent entry.
*   **`.eslintrc.json`**:
    *   Multiple updates throughout **1/31/2026**, starting at **12:05:37 PM**.
    *   Initially extended `airbnb` and `prettier`, with React and TypeScript import resolver settings. Rules like `no-console: off`, `no-unused-vars: warn`, `func-names: off`, and `class-methods-use-this: off` were set.
    *   The `settings` block for React and import resolver was removed at **12:05:53 PM**, and `no-process-exit: off`, `object-shorthand: off` were added.
    *   The core `prettier/prettier: error` rule was temporarily commented out at **12:58:16 PM**, then uncommented and `import/extensions: 0` was added at **3:09:42 PM**.
    *   Further rules `no-param-reassign: 0` were added at **3:54:21 PM**.
    *   A more specific `prettier/prettier` rule was introduced at **4:01:43 PM** to enforce `singleQuote: true` and `semi: false` within ESLint, while the general `prettier/prettier: "error"` rule was commented out again at **4:01:58 PM**.
    *   On **2/1/2026, 1:03:43 PM**, `plugin:node/recommended` was added to the `extends` configuration, expanding the linting scope to include Node.js-specific rules.
*   **`package.json`**:
    *   Changes between **1/31/2026, 2:47:35 PM** and **2/1/2026, 1:47:56 PM**.
    *   The `react` dependency was temporarily upgraded from `^17.0.2` to `^18.3.1` at **2:50:11 PM** but then reverted back to `^17.0.2` at **2:58:26 PM**.
    *   During the revert, `@types/react` was updated from `^17.0.39` to `^17.0.90`, and `@types/react-dom` from `^17.0.13` to `^17.0.26`.
    *   The `"type": "module"` entry was present initially, removed at **2/1/2026, 1:45:20 PM**, and then re-added at **2/1/2026, 1:47:56 PM**.
*   **`src\App.tsx`**:
    *   Several minor formatting and import changes occurred between **1/31/2026, 3:05:17 PM** and **3:16:06 PM**.
    *   New routes for `/clientEmails`, `/customEmails`, `/imageText`, `/imageTextNew`, `/opponentsnumber`, and `/stats` were added around **3:05:17 PM**.
    *   There was a recurring pattern of toggling the import path for `Login` between `./Pages/Login` and `./Pages/Login.tsx` multiple times during this period, suggesting formatting adjustments or developer testing.
*   **`src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`**:
    *   Multiple updates between **1/31/2026, 3:22:35 PM** and **3:47:25 PM**, mainly involving import reordering and minor formatting adjustments.
    *   Notably, the `toast` import was moved to the very top at **3:44:19 PM**, and `Maindiv` import positioning was adjusted around the Ant Design imports between **3:46:51 PM** and **3:47:25 PM**.
    *   The component handles "tla" and "opposition" hearings, displaying unverified and verified journals, and includes functionalities like verifying entries, updating location, and sending reports.
*   **`src\Pages\Watchautomation\WatchautomationSlice.ts`**:
    *   Introduced at **1/31/2026, 3:52:12 PM**, defining a comprehensive Redux Toolkit slice.
    *   It outlines an `InitialStateType` for various watch automation features (e.g., `tmApplied`, `tmProtect`, `imageLabel`, `imageText`, `imageSimilarity`, `tmProtectNew`), including their loading/error/success states, data structures, pagination, and filter options (journals, users, date ranges).
    *   Includes `createAsyncThunk` actions for fetching different types of reports and profiles related to TM applications and protection.
*   **`src\Pages\CustomReports\CustomReports.tsx`**:
    *   Updated at **1/31/2026, 4:00:21 PM**.
    *   The `MyTable` styled component was enhanced with specific `rowClassName` rules to apply background colors (`bg-row-manager`, `bg-row-watch`, `bg-row-search`) based on the `product` field of each report record.
    *   A `CustomReportColumn` styled component was added, intended for conditional styling within table cells.
    *   Includes functionality to fetch and re-queue custom reports.
*   **`src\Pages\Dashboard\Dashboard.tsx`**:
    *   Added at **1/31/2026, 4:03:39 PM**.
    *   Implements a dashboard with Ant Design `Tabs` to switch between "Monitoring" and "Finished" tasks, displaying task details, frequency, retry information, and last checked/completed dates.
    *   Fetches data for upcoming and monitoring tasks via Redux actions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Configuration Focus**: A significant portion of the changes involved fine-tuning development environment configurations, specifically ESLint and Prettier, indicating an effort to standardize code style and quality. This included frequent adjustments to `singleQuote` settings and how Prettier rules are applied within ESLint.
*   **React Application Development**: The project is clearly a React application (`.tsx` files, `package.json` dependencies like `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `react-redux`).
*   **Redux Toolkit for State Management**: Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux`) is consistently used for managing application state and handling asynchronous operations (`createAsyncThunk`).
*   **Ant Design UI Library**: Ant Design (`antd`) is a primary UI component library, used extensively for tables, buttons, selects, and layout elements across various pages.
*   **Modular Page Structure**: The application is organized into a `Pages` directory, with individual components for different features like `Login`, `Search`, `Watch`, `Patent`, `Hearing`, `Dashboard`, `CustomReports`, and `Watchautomation`.
*   **Authentication/Authorization**: The presence of `PrivateRoute` in `App.tsx` and checks for user data in `localStorage` indicate an authentication mechanism is in place, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
*   **Timestamp Concentration**: The bulk of the changes occurred on **January 31, 2026**, suggesting a focused development or refactoring sprint on that day, with minor follow-ups on **February 1, 2026**.

    *   **2/1/2026, 1:47:56 PM:** Re-added the `"type": "module"` property.

*   **`src\App.tsx`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 3:05:17 PM - 3:16:06 PM:** Several minor, cosmetic changes related to the import statement for the `Login` component, specifically toggling between `import Login from "./Pages/Login";` and `import Login from "./Pages/Login.tsx";` or changing quote styles, indicating repetitive formatting or save operations.

*   **`src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 3:22:35 PM - 3:47:25 PM:** Minor reordering of import statements (e.g., `toast` and `Maindiv`) which did not alter functionality, suggesting formatting changes.

*   **`src\Pages\Watchautomation\WatchautomationSlice.ts`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 3:52:12 PM:** A new file was added, implementing a Redux slice for watch automation features. It defines an `InitialStateType` with detailed state for various report types (e.g., `tmApplied`, `tmProtect`, `imageLabel`, `imageText`, `imageSimilarity`, `tmProtectNew`), including loading/error/success states, data, page counts, and filter options. It also sets up `createAsyncThunk` actions for fetching these reports and their associated profiles/journals.

*   **`src\Pages\CustomReports\CustomReports.tsx`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 4:00:21 PM:** Introduced a component for Custom Reports, featuring an Ant Design table (`MyTable`) to display report data. It includes columns for ID, Email, Creation Origin, Created/Modified dates, Report Title, Selected Marks, Files, and a "Re-Queue" action. It also defines styled components for table styling and dynamic row coloring based on the report's `product` type (Manager, Watch, Search). The table's scroll height was initially a commented-out calculation.
    *   **2/1/2026, 2:55:19 PM:** Updated the `scroll` property of `MyTable` to dynamically set its vertical height based on `window.innerHeight - 210`.

*   **`src\Pages\Dashboard\Dashboard.tsx`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 4:03:39 PM:** Introduced a Dashboard component with two tabs: "Monitoring" and "Finished". It displays tasks with details like frequency, retry count, and last checked. The table's scroll height was initially a commented-out calculation.
    *   **2/1/2026, 2:54:36 PM - 2:54:46 PM:** Updated the `scroll` property of `MyTable` in both the "Monitoring" and "Finished" tabs to dynamically set its vertical height based on `window.innerHeight - 230`.

*   **`src\Pages\CustomEmails\CustomEmails.tsx`:**
    *   **2/1/2026, 2:55:08 PM:** A new component was added for managing custom email settings. It utilizes an Ant Design table to list email profiles, their hosts (Gmail, Outlook, Office 365), and actions (toggle active, edit, delete). It integrates modals (`CreateCustomEmail`, `CreateCustomEmailOffice365`) for adding and editing settings, and includes a search functionality for profiles/emails. The table's scroll height is dynamically set to `window.innerHeight - 230`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Configuration Refinement:** There's a noticeable pattern of continuous adjustments to ESLint and Prettier configurations, including toggling rules (e.g., `singleQuote`, `prettier/prettier`), adding new linting rules, and incorporating Node.js-specific plugins. This suggests an ongoing effort to enforce code style and quality.
*   **Dependency Management:** Updates and occasional reversions of core dependencies like `react` (between v17 and v18) and `@types/react`/`@types/react-dom` indicate dependency management challenges or experimentation. The repeated addition/removal of `"type": "module"` in `package.json` suggests adjusting module resolution for the project.
*   **Minor Import/Formatting Tweaks:** The `App.tsx` and `Hearing.tsx` files show recurring, very small changes in import statements (e.g., file extensions, quote styles), often reverted, which point to automated formatting tools being run or minor manual adjustments that don't affect functionality.
*   **Dynamic Table Scrolling:** A consistent pattern emerged in `CustomReports.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, and `CustomEmails.tsx` where table scrolling height is set dynamically using `window.innerHeight - X`, indicating a focus on optimizing UI layout for different screen sizes.
*   **Redux Toolkit & Ant Design:** New feature implementations (`WatchautomationSlice.ts`, `CustomEmails.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `CustomReports.tsx`) consistently leverage Redux Toolkit for state management and Ant Design components for UI, highlighting a standardized tech stack within the project.
*   **Consistent Error Handling:** `createAsyncThunk` actions consistently implement `try-catch` blocks with `thunkAPI.rejectWithValue(error.response)` for robust error handling in asynchronous operations.
*   **User Authentication Check:** Multiple components (`App.tsx`, `Hearing.tsx`) include an `useEffect` hook to check `localStorage.getItem("user")` and redirect to the login page if no user is found, indicating a common client-side authentication flow.
