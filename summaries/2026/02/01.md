    *   Multiple updates throughout **1/31/2026**, starting at **12:05:37 PM**.
    *   Initially extended `airbnb` and `prettier`, with React and TypeScript import resolver settings. Rules like `no-console: off`, `no-unused-vars: warn`, `func-names: off`, and `class-methods-use-this: off` were set.
    *   The `settings` block for React and import resolver was removed at **12:05:53 PM**, and `no-process-exit: off`, `object-shorthand: off` were added.
    *   The core `prettier/prettier: error` rule was temporarily commented out at **12:58:16 PM**, then uncommented and `import/extensions: 0` was added at **3:09:42 PM**.
    *   Further rules `no-param-reassign: 0` were added at **3:54:21 PM**.
    *   A more specific `prettier/prettier` rule was introduced at **4:01:43 PM** to enforce `singleQuote: true` and `semi: false` within ESLint, while the general `prettier/prettier: "error"` rule was commented out again at **4:01:58 PM**.
    *   On **2/1/2026, 1:03:43 PM**, `plugin:node/recommended` was added to the `extends` configuration, expanding the linting scope to include Node.js-specific rules.
*   **`package.json`**:
    *   Changes between **1/31/2026, 2:47:35 PM** and **2/1/2026, 1:47:56 PM**.
    *   The `react` dependency was temporarily upgraded from `^17.0.2` to `^18.3.1` at **2:50:11 PM** but then reverted back to `^17.0.2` at **2:58:26 PM**.
    *   During the revert, `@types/react` was updated from `^17.0.39` to `^17.0.90`, and `@types/react-dom` from `^17.0.13` to `^17.0.26`.
    *   The `"type": "module"` entry was present initially, removed at **2/1/2026, 1:45:20 PM**, and then re-added at **2/1/2026, 1:47:56 PM**.
*   **`src\App.tsx`**:
    *   Several minor formatting and import changes occurred between **1/31/2026, 3:05:17 PM** and **3:16:06 PM**.
    *   New routes for `/clientEmails`, `/customEmails`, `/imageText`, `/imageTextNew`, `/opponentsnumber`, and `/stats` were added around **3:05:17 PM**.
    *   There was a recurring pattern of toggling the import path for `Login` between `./Pages/Login` and `./Pages/Login.tsx` multiple times during this period, suggesting formatting adjustments or developer testing.
*   **`src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`**:
    *   Multiple updates between **1/31/2026, 3:22:35 PM** and **3:47:25 PM**, mainly involving import reordering and minor formatting adjustments.
    *   Notably, the `toast` import was moved to the very top at **3:44:19 PM**, and `Maindiv` import positioning was adjusted around the Ant Design imports between **3:46:51 PM** and **3:47:25 PM**.
    *   The component handles "tla" and "opposition" hearings, displaying unverified and verified journals, and includes functionalities like verifying entries, updating location, and sending reports.
*   **`src\Pages\Watchautomation\WatchautomationSlice.ts`**:
    *   Introduced at **1/31/2026, 3:52:12 PM**, defining a comprehensive Redux Toolkit slice.
    *   It outlines an `InitialStateType` for various watch automation features (e.g., `tmApplied`, `tmProtect`, `imageLabel`, `imageText`, `imageSimilarity`, `tmProtectNew`), including their loading/error/success states, data structures, pagination, and filter options (journals, users, date ranges).
    *   Includes `createAsyncThunk` actions for fetching different types of reports and profiles related to TM applications and protection.
*   **`src\Pages\CustomReports\CustomReports.tsx`**:
    *   Updated at **1/31/2026, 4:00:21 PM**.
    *   The `MyTable` styled component was enhanced with specific `rowClassName` rules to apply background colors (`bg-row-manager`, `bg-row-watch`, `bg-row-search`) based on the `product` field of each report record.
    *   A `CustomReportColumn` styled component was added, intended for conditional styling within table cells.
    *   Includes functionality to fetch and re-queue custom reports.
*   **`src\Pages\Dashboard\Dashboard.tsx`**:
    *   Added at **1/31/2026, 4:03:39 PM**.
    *   Implements a dashboard with Ant Design `Tabs` to switch between "Monitoring" and "Finished" tasks, displaying task details, frequency, retry information, and last checked/completed dates.
    *   Fetches data for upcoming and monitoring tasks via Redux actions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Configuration Focus**: A significant portion of the changes involved fine-tuning development environment configurations, specifically ESLint and Prettier, indicating an effort to standardize code style and quality. This included frequent adjustments to `singleQuote` settings and how Prettier rules are applied within ESLint.
*   **React Application Development**: The project is clearly a React application (`.tsx` files, `package.json` dependencies like `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `react-redux`).
*   **Redux Toolkit for State Management**: Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux`) is consistently used for managing application state and handling asynchronous operations (`createAsyncThunk`).
*   **Ant Design UI Library**: Ant Design (`antd`) is a primary UI component library, used extensively for tables, buttons, selects, and layout elements across various pages.
*   **Modular Page Structure**: The application is organized into a `Pages` directory, with individual components for different features like `Login`, `Search`, `Watch`, `Patent`, `Hearing`, `Dashboard`, `CustomReports`, and `Watchautomation`.
*   **Authentication/Authorization**: The presence of `PrivateRoute` in `App.tsx` and checks for user data in `localStorage` indicate an authentication mechanism is in place, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
*   **Timestamp Concentration**: The bulk of the changes occurred on **January 31, 2026**, suggesting a focused development or refactoring sprint on that day, with minor follow-ups on **February 1, 2026**.

*   **`src\App.tsx`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 3:05:17 PM - 3:16:06 PM:** Several minor, cosmetic changes related to the import statement for the `Login` component, specifically toggling between `import Login from "./Pages/Login";` and `import Login from "./Pages/Login.tsx";` or changing quote styles, indicating repetitive formatting or save operations.

*   **`src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 3:22:35 PM - 3:47:25 PM:** Minor reordering of import statements (e.g., `toast` and `Maindiv`) which did not alter functionality, suggesting formatting changes.

*   **`src\Pages\Watchautomation\WatchautomationSlice.ts`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 3:52:12 PM:** A new file was added, implementing a Redux slice for watch automation features. It defines an `InitialStateType` with detailed state for various report types (e.g., `tmApplied`, `tmProtect`, `imageLabel`, `imageText`, `imageSimilarity`, `tmProtectNew`), including loading/error/success states, data, page counts, and filter options. It also sets up `createAsyncThunk` actions for fetching these reports and their associated profiles/journals.

*   **`src\Pages\CustomReports\CustomReports.tsx`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 4:00:21 PM:** Introduced a component for Custom Reports, featuring an Ant Design table (`MyTable`) to display report data. It includes columns for ID, Email, Creation Origin, Created/Modified dates, Report Title, Selected Marks, Files, and a "Re-Queue" action. It also defines styled components for table styling and dynamic row coloring based on the report's `product` type (Manager, Watch, Search). The table's scroll height was initially a commented-out calculation.
    *   **2/1/2026, 2:55:19 PM:** Updated the `scroll` property of `MyTable` to dynamically set its vertical height based on `window.innerHeight - 210`.

*   **`src\Pages\Dashboard\Dashboard.tsx`:**
    *   **1/31/2026, 4:03:39 PM:** Introduced a Dashboard component with two tabs: "Monitoring" and "Finished". It displays tasks with details like frequency, retry count, and last checked. The table's scroll height was initially a commented-out calculation.
    *   **2/1/2026, 2:54:36 PM - 2:54:46 PM:** Updated the `scroll` property of `MyTable` in both the "Monitoring" and "Finished" tabs to dynamically set its vertical height based on `window.innerHeight - 230`.

*   **`src\Pages\CustomEmails\CustomEmails.tsx`:**
    *   **2/1/2026, 2:55:08 PM:** A new component was added for managing custom email settings. It utilizes an Ant Design table to list email profiles, their hosts (Gmail, Outlook, Office 365), and actions (toggle active, edit, delete). It integrates modals (`CreateCustomEmail`, `CreateCustomEmailOffice365`) for adding and editing settings, and includes a search functionality for profiles/emails. The table's scroll height is dynamically set to `window.innerHeight - 230`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Configuration Refinement:** There's a noticeable pattern of continuous adjustments to ESLint and Prettier configurations, including toggling rules (e.g., `singleQuote`, `prettier/prettier`), adding new linting rules, and incorporating Node.js-specific plugins. This suggests an ongoing effort to enforce code style and quality.
*   **Dependency Management:** Updates and occasional reversions of core dependencies like `react` (between v17 and v18) and `@types/react`/`@types/react-dom` indicate dependency management challenges or experimentation. The repeated addition/removal of `"type": "module"` in `package.json` suggests adjusting module resolution for the project.
*   **Minor Import/Formatting Tweaks:** The `App.tsx` and `Hearing.tsx` files show recurring, very small changes in import statements (e.g., file extensions, quote styles), often reverted, which point to automated formatting tools being run or minor manual adjustments that don't affect functionality.
*   **Dynamic Table Scrolling:** A consistent pattern emerged in `CustomReports.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, and `CustomEmails.tsx` where table scrolling height is set dynamically using `window.innerHeight - X`, indicating a focus on optimizing UI layout for different screen sizes.
*   **Redux Toolkit & Ant Design:** New feature implementations (`WatchautomationSlice.ts`, `CustomEmails.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `CustomReports.tsx`) consistently leverage Redux Toolkit for state management and Ant Design components for UI, highlighting a standardized tech stack within the project.
*   **Consistent Error Handling:** `createAsyncThunk` actions consistently implement `try-catch` blocks with `thunkAPI.rejectWithValue(error.response)` for robust error handling in asynchronous operations.
*   **User Authentication Check:** Multiple components (`App.tsx`, `Hearing.tsx`) include an `useEffect` hook to check `localStorage.getItem("user")` and redirect to the login page if no user is found, indicating a common client-side authentication flow.

## 3:56:06 PM
The code changes primarily focus on refining code style configurations, managing dependencies, adjusting UI rendering logic for tables, and minor organizational updates within the React application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

    *   The table's `scroll` property was updated on 2/1/2026, 2:59:02 PM to use `window.innerHeight`.

*   **`src\Pages\Search\Search.tsx`**:
    *   (Initial change at 2/1/2026, 2:59:19 PM) Displays search reports categorized by "File", "Search", and "Proprietors", with re-queue functionality.
    *   The `scroll` property for the "File" and "Search" tables was updated across several commits (2/1/2026, 2:59:19 PM to 2:59:42 PM) to use `window.innerHeight`. The "Proprietors" table retained its `calc(100vh - 300px)` scroll setting.

*   **`src\Pages\Watch\Watch.tsx` (second entry)**:
    *   (Initial change at 2/1/2026, 2:59:51 PM) This file (distinct from `Portfolio/Watch/Watch.tsx`) focuses on individual journal watching. It displays journal statistics (missing marks, total marks, published date) and provides actions like scanning, refreshing, and verifying journals.
    *   The table's `scroll` property was commented out on 2/1/2026, 2:59:51 PM, with no dynamic height replacement specified in this log entry.

*   **`src\Pages\Watchautomation\Watchautomation.tsx`**:
    *   (Initial change at 2/1/2026, 2:59:58 PM) Manages automated watch reports across multiple tabs (e.g., TM Applied, TM Protect, Image Label, Image Text, Image Similarity) with filtering capabilities by profile and journal/date range.
    *   Subsequent entries (2/1/2026, 3:00:06 PM to 3:00:31 PM) appear to be minor saves or formatting updates.

*   **`src\app\functions\interceptor.tsx`**:
    *   (Initial change at 2/1/2026, 3:18:16 PM) Implements Axios interceptors to handle `401` or `403` HTTP status codes. Upon such errors, it clears `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, then redirects the user to the root path (`/`) and reloads the window, indicating a global authentication error handling mechanism.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Code Quality & Formatting**: Frequent updates to `.prettierrc.json` and `.eslintrc.json` suggest an active effort to maintain consistent code style and enforce linting rules across the project. The temporary conflict and subsequent commenting out of `prettier/prettier` in `eslintrc.json` indicate an ongoing refinement of how Prettier and Eslint interact.
*   **Dynamic Table Scrolling**: A significant recurring change (observed in `CustomReports.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `CustomEmails.tsx`, `Hearing/Modals/SearchTM.tsx`, `OpponentNumbers.tsx`, `Portfolio/Watch/Watch.tsx`, `Search/Search.tsx`) is the modification of Ant Design `Table` components' `scroll` property. Many instances of `scroll={{ y: "calc(100vh - XXXpx)" }}` were replaced with `scroll={{ y: window.innerHeight - YYY }}`. This pattern suggests a move towards more responsive and dynamic table height adjustments based on the browser window's height.
*   **Redux Toolkit for State Management**: The project heavily relies on Redux Toolkit for managing application state, dispatching actions, and handling asynchronous operations across numerous pages (e.g., `HearingSlice`, `WatchautomationSlice`, `DashboardSlice`).
*   **Authentication Handling**: A centralized `interceptor.tsx` for Axios demonstrates a consistent approach to handling API authentication errors (`401`, `403`) by clearing session data and forcing a re-login.
*   **Component Structure**: The `src\Pages` directory contains many feature-specific React components (`Hearing`, `Watchautomation`, `CustomReports`, `Dashboard`, `CustomEmails`, `OpponentNumbers`, `Search`, `Watch`), each often integrating with Redux and Ant Design for UI.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Numerous log entries for the same file within minutes or seconds (e.g., `src\App.tsx`, `src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`, `src\Pages\Watchautomation\Watchautomation.tsx`, `src\Pages\Hearing\Modals\SearchTM.tsx`) suggest iterative development, frequent saving, or automated formatting.

## 7:16:33 PM
The provided log details code changes primarily focused on configuration and the initial development of several UI components, predominantly within a React application using Ant Design and Redux Toolkit. All observed changes occurred on January 31, 2026, and February 1, 2026.

Here's a summary of the key information:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`.prettierrc.json`**:
    *   **January 31, 2026, 12:01:30 PM**: Initialized Prettier with `singleQuote: true`, `semi: true`, `trailingComma: "es5"`, `printWidth: 80`, `tabWidth: 2`, and `endOfLine: "auto"`.
    *   **January 31, 2026, 2:40:57 PM**: Modified `singleQuote` from `true` to `false`. Subsequent entry at **2:41:28 PM** reaffirmed this change.
*   **`.eslintrc.json`**:

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Code Formatting and Linting Configuration**: There's a clear emphasis on establishing and refining code style and quality, seen in the frequent modifications to `.prettierrc.json` and `.eslintrc.json`. This includes adjustments to `singleQuote` preferences, the addition of new linting rules (`import/extensions`, `no-param-reassign`), and integration of Node.js-specific linting.
2.  **Dynamic Table Sizing**: A significant and consistent pattern across multiple UI components (e.g., `Hearing.tsx`, `CustomReports.tsx`, `Dashboard.tsx`, `CustomEmails.tsx`, `SearchTM.tsx`, `OpponentNumbers.tsx`, `Watch.tsx` within Portfolio, `Search.tsx` within Pages) on **February 1, 2026**, is the implementation of dynamic table heights. This involved changing commented-out `scroll={{ y: "calc(100vh - XXXpx)" }}` to active `scroll={{ y: window.innerHeight - YYY }}` properties for Ant Design tables, indicating a focus on responsive UI design.
3.  **Redux Toolkit for State Management**: The project heavily leverages Redux Toolkit, particularly `createAsyncThunk` for handling asynchronous data operations and `useSelector`/`useDispatch` hooks in React components, demonstrating a standardized approach to state management.
4.  **Ant Design UI Framework**: The application extensively uses Ant Design components (Tables, Tabs, Buttons, Selects, Modals, Typography, etc.) for its user interface across newly introduced pages and modals.
5.  **Modular Application Structure**: The `src/Pages` directory is organized into distinct functional modules (e.g., Login, Search, Watch, Patent, ControlCenter, Hearing, CustomReports, Portfolio, Dashboard), suggesting a clear separation of concerns.
6.  **Centralized Authentication Handling**: User session management and unauthorized access are handled centrally through Axios interceptors (`interceptor.tsx`) and application-level routing (`App.tsx`), ensuring consistent behavior for 401/403 errors and user login state.
7.  **Focus on Data Display and Management**: Many of the new components are designed to display tabular data, often with filtering, pagination, and actions like "Re-Queue" or "Verify," indicating a data-intensive application.

*   **`src\app\functions\interceptor.tsx`**:
    *   Added on Feb 1, 2026, at 3:18:16 PM, this file implements Axios interceptors. It handles HTTP `401` or `403` status codes by clearing `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, then redirecting the user to the root path (`/`) and reloading the window, ensuring session invalidation on unauthorized access.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Ant Design & Styled Components:** The project heavily utilizes Ant Design for UI components (Tables, Tabs, Buttons, Modals, Selects) and Styled Components for custom styling, indicating a consistent approach to frontend development and theming.
2.  **Redux Toolkit for State Management:** All newly introduced feature components (Hearings, Watch automation, Custom Reports, Dashboards, Custom Emails, Opponent Numbers, Search, Watch) leverage `react-redux` (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) and Redux Toolkit for managing global state and asynchronous data fetching.
3.  **Authentication Handling:** A clear pattern for handling authentication is present, involving checking `localStorage` for user data upon component mount (`App.tsx`) and using Axios interceptors to automatically log out users on `401` or `403` responses (`interceptor.tsx`).
4.  **Dynamic Table Height Adjustment:** A significant, recurring theme across multiple components displaying tabular data (`Dashboard.tsx`, `CustomEmails.tsx`, `CustomReports.tsx`, `OpponentNumbers.tsx`, `SearchTM.tsx`, `Portfolio\Watch\Watch.tsx`, `Search\Search.tsx`, `Watch\Watch.tsx`, `Watchautomation\Watchautomation.tsx`) is the introduction or modification of `scroll={{ y: window.innerHeight - XXX }}` on Ant Design `Table` components. This pattern aims to make tables dynamically fill the available vertical screen space, improving responsiveness.
5.  **Linting and Formatting Refinements:** The frequent modifications to `.prettierrc.json` and `.eslintrc.json`, particularly the toggling of the `prettier/prettier` rule and the explicit disabling of `import/extensions` and `no-param-reassign`, highlight ongoing efforts to establish and enforce code style and quality standards.
6.  **Module Resolution Challenges:** The repeated changes to the `Login` import path in `App.tsx` (with and without the `.tsx` extension) suggest minor module resolution or build configuration inconsistencies being addressed.
7.  **Feature Expansion:** A large number of new pages and functionalities were added, mostly related to various "Watch" and "Report" automation features, alongside email management and opponent data tracking.
