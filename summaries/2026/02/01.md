The provided log details a series of code changes within the `iris-new` project, primarily focusing on configuration, dependency management, and front-end application structure using React, Redux Toolkit, and Ant Design. All changes occurred on January 31, 2026, with a few final updates spilling over into February 1, 2026.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`.prettierrc.json`**:
    *   Initial configuration was set at **1/31/2026, 12:01:30 PM**, enforcing semicolons, single quotes, ES5 trailing commas, an 80-character print width, 2-space tabs, and auto end-of-line.
    *   The `singleQuote` setting was changed from `true` to `false` at **1/31/2026, 2:40:57 PM**, and then remained `false` in a subsequent entry.
*   **`.eslintrc.json`**:
    *   Multiple updates throughout **1/31/2026**, starting at **12:05:37 PM**.
    *   Initially extended `airbnb` and `prettier`, with React and TypeScript import resolver settings. Rules like `no-console: off`, `no-unused-vars: warn`, `func-names: off`, and `class-methods-use-this: off` were set.
    *   The `settings` block for React and import resolver was removed at **12:05:53 PM**, and `no-process-exit: off`, `object-shorthand: off` were added.
    *   The core `prettier/prettier: error` rule was temporarily commented out at **12:58:16 PM**, then uncommented and `import/extensions: 0` was added at **3:09:42 PM**.
    *   Further rules `no-param-reassign: 0` were added at **3:54:21 PM**.
    *   A more specific `prettier/prettier` rule was introduced at **4:01:43 PM** to enforce `singleQuote: true` and `semi: false` within ESLint, while the general `prettier/prettier: "error"` rule was commented out again at **4:01:58 PM**.
    *   On **2/1/2026, 1:03:43 PM**, `plugin:node/recommended` was added to the `extends` configuration, expanding the linting scope to include Node.js-specific rules.
*   **`package.json`**:
    *   Changes between **1/31/2026, 2:47:35 PM** and **2/1/2026, 1:47:56 PM**.
    *   The `react` dependency was temporarily upgraded from `^17.0.2` to `^18.3.1` at **2:50:11 PM** but then reverted back to `^17.0.2` at **2:58:26 PM**.
    *   During the revert, `@types/react` was updated from `^17.0.39` to `^17.0.90`, and `@types/react-dom` from `^17.0.13` to `^17.0.26`.
    *   The `"type": "module"` entry was present initially, removed at **2/1/2026, 1:45:20 PM**, and then re-added at **2/1/2026, 1:47:56 PM**.
*   **`src\App.tsx`**:
    *   Several minor formatting and import changes occurred between **1/31/2026, 3:05:17 PM** and **3:16:06 PM**.
    *   New routes for `/clientEmails`, `/customEmails`, `/imageText`, `/imageTextNew`, `/opponentsnumber`, and `/stats` were added around **3:05:17 PM**.
    *   There was a recurring pattern of toggling the import path for `Login` between `./Pages/Login` and `./Pages/Login.tsx` multiple times during this period, suggesting formatting adjustments or developer testing.
*   **`src\Pages\Hearing\Hearing.tsx`**:
    *   Multiple updates between **1/31/2026, 3:22:35 PM** and **3:47:25 PM**, mainly involving import reordering and minor formatting adjustments.
    *   Notably, the `toast` import was moved to the very top at **3:44:19 PM**, and `Maindiv` import positioning was adjusted around the Ant Design imports between **3:46:51 PM** and **3:47:25 PM**.
    *   The component handles "tla" and "opposition" hearings, displaying unverified and verified journals, and includes functionalities like verifying entries, updating location, and sending reports.
*   **`src\Pages\Watchautomation\WatchautomationSlice.ts`**:
    *   Introduced at **1/31/2026, 3:52:12 PM**, defining a comprehensive Redux Toolkit slice.
    *   It outlines an `InitialStateType` for various watch automation features (e.g., `tmApplied`, `tmProtect`, `imageLabel`, `imageText`, `imageSimilarity`, `tmProtectNew`), including their loading/error/success states, data structures, pagination, and filter options (journals, users, date ranges).
    *   Includes `createAsyncThunk` actions for fetching different types of reports and profiles related to TM applications and protection.
*   **`src\Pages\CustomReports\CustomReports.tsx`**:
    *   Updated at **1/31/2026, 4:00:21 PM**.
    *   The `MyTable` styled component was enhanced with specific `rowClassName` rules to apply background colors (`bg-row-manager`, `bg-row-watch`, `bg-row-search`) based on the `product` field of each report record.
    *   A `CustomReportColumn` styled component was added, intended for conditional styling within table cells.
    *   Includes functionality to fetch and re-queue custom reports.
*   **`src\Pages\Dashboard\Dashboard.tsx`**:
    *   Added at **1/31/2026, 4:03:39 PM**.
    *   Implements a dashboard with Ant Design `Tabs` to switch between "Monitoring" and "Finished" tasks, displaying task details, frequency, retry information, and last checked/completed dates.
    *   Fetches data for upcoming and monitoring tasks via Redux actions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Configuration Focus**: A significant portion of the changes involved fine-tuning development environment configurations, specifically ESLint and Prettier, indicating an effort to standardize code style and quality. This included frequent adjustments to `singleQuote` settings and how Prettier rules are applied within ESLint.
*   **React Application Development**: The project is clearly a React application (`.tsx` files, `package.json` dependencies like `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `react-redux`).
*   **Redux Toolkit for State Management**: Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux`) is consistently used for managing application state and handling asynchronous operations (`createAsyncThunk`).
*   **Ant Design UI Library**: Ant Design (`antd`) is a primary UI component library, used extensively for tables, buttons, selects, and layout elements across various pages.
*   **Modular Page Structure**: The application is organized into a `Pages` directory, with individual components for different features like `Login`, `Search`, `Watch`, `Patent`, `Hearing`, `Dashboard`, `CustomReports`, and `Watchautomation`.
*   **Authentication/Authorization**: The presence of `PrivateRoute` in `App.tsx` and checks for user data in `localStorage` indicate an authentication mechanism is in place, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
*   **Timestamp Concentration**: The bulk of the changes occurred on **January 31, 2026**, suggesting a focused development or refactoring sprint on that day, with minor follow-ups on **February 1, 2026**.
