# Activity Summary for 2/20/2026

## 2:21:08 PM
The provided log details changes across multiple frontend files, primarily focusing on React components and GraphQL queries within the `MikeCLM` application.

**File-specific Updates and Timestamps:**

**1. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\Reports\Reports.tsx`**
   - **Timestamp: 2/19/2026, 2:12:48 PM - 2:15:52 PM**
     - Initial import `downloadStreamingFile` was removed.
     - The `handleDownload` function was completely refactored. The older `downloadStreamingFile` utility was replaced with a direct `axiosInstance.get` call to `/api/reports/download/`. The new implementation retrieves a `download_url` from the backend response, creates an anchor element, sets its `href` and `download` attributes, and programmatically clicks it to initiate the download. This indicates a shift in how report downloads are handled, moving towards a more direct, URL-based approach.

**2. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
   - **Timestamp: 2/19/2026, 2:25:27 PM - 3:41:27 PM**
     - The `uploadFile` function underwent a significant overhaul.
     - Initially, it retrieved a signed S3 URL and fields, then uploaded directly to S3.
     - The changes introduce conditional logic to support different upload mechanisms:
       - If `data?.requires_direct_upload` is `true` (and `data?.url` is `falsy`), it now uses `axiosInstance.post` to `/api/contract-documents/` with a FormData object, suggesting a direct upload to a SharePoint backend or similar system. This path also includes `onUploadProgress` to track the upload.
       - If `data?.url` and `data?.fields` exist (and `data?.requires_direct_upload` is `falsy`), it proceeds with the S3 direct upload, also including `onUploadProgress`.
     - Several previous versions of the `uploadFile` function were commented out, showing iterative development and testing of different backend upload strategies. The `onUploadProgress` callback was added to both direct upload scenarios.
     - A condition `!data?.url && data?.requires_direct_upload === true` was refined to `data?.requires_direct_upload === true && !data?.url` for SharePoint upload, and `data?.requires_direct_upload !== true` for S3 upload.

**3. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\utils\allContractsQueries.ts`**
   - **Timestamp: 2/19/2026, 4:02:28 PM - 2/20/2026, 10:48:37 AM**
     - Consistent updates across multiple commits primarily involved formatting, re-ordering, or minor whitespace changes within the GraphQL `gql` template literals.
     - A notable functional change occurred around **2/20/2026, 10:40:34 AM**, where `autoRenewalType` and `autoRenewalTerm` were added to the `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID` and `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID_EXT` queries. This indicates an enhancement to contract details, likely to track and manage automated renewals more thoroughly.

**4. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\ContractOverview\ContractHeader.tsx`**
   - **Timestamp: 2/20/2026, 9:44:08 AM - 10:45:50 AM**
     - Initial changes involved commenting out the "Download" button.
     - Around **2/20/2026, 9:44:50 AM**, the "Download" button was uncommented and re-enabled.
     - A significant update occurred around **2/20/2026, 10:10:44 AM**, where the `handleDownload` function was modified to asynchronously refetch the latest file URLs (`signedFileUrl`, `partiallySignedFileUrl`, `fileUrl`) using `refreshDocumentFileUrl` before initiating the download. This ensures the user always downloads the most up-to-date version of the contract, especially after signing or partial signing.
     - The `documentId` prop was added to the `ContractHeaderProps` interface, then removed.
     - Console logs like `"Govind"` and "FILE URL Refresh" were added for debugging purposes at various points and later removed, indicating active development and testing.

**5. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\hooks\useDocumentData.ts`**
   - **Timestamp: 2/20/2026, 10:01:39 AM - 10:04:45 AM**
     - Introduced `GET_DOCUMENT_FILE_URL_ONLY` import from `@mike-clm/shared`.
     - Added a new `useLazyQuery` for `GET_DOCUMENT_FILE_URL_ONLY` to fetch only file URLs.
     - Implemented `refreshDocumentFileUrl` useCallback function. This function uses the new lazy query to fetch the latest `fileUrl`, `signedFileUrl`, or `partiallySignedFileUrl` for a given `documentId`. This complements the `handleDownload` logic in `ContractHeader.tsx`.
     - The `refreshDocumentFileUrl` function was added to the return object of the `useDocumentData` hook, making it available to consuming components.

**6. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\utils\index.ts`**
   - **Timestamp: 2/20/2026, 10:01:16 AM**
     - Updated exports, specifically commenting out `EDIT_DOCUMENT`, `CREATE_PARTY_SIGNATORIES`, `EDIT_PARTY_SIGNATORIES`, `CREATE_SIGNATURE_REQUEST` from a re-export list, and adding `normalizeAgreementHistory`, `bifurcateJsonField`, and `sectionMappings` exports. This suggests a restructuring of shared utilities and potentially a deprecation of direct GraphQL mutation exports in favor of a more encapsulated approach or a different module structure.

**7. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\AllContracts\ContractOverviewRefactored.tsx`**
   - **Timestamp: 2/20/2026, 10:06:11 AM - 10:44:15 AM**
     - The `refreshDocumentFileUrl` function was added to the `useDocumentContext` destructuring. This indicates that the `ContractOverviewInner` component now has access to the new file URL refreshing capability from the `DocumentContext`.
     - Updates were made to `prepareExistingSignCoordinates` and `convertExistingSignCoordinates` `useCallback` functions. Specifically, the `convertExistingSignCoordinates` now includes `userName` in the returned object, and both functions contain extensive console logging for debugging the signature coordinate preparation process. This suggests ongoing work on the contract signing feature, particularly around handling and displaying signatory information and their coordinates.

**8. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\contexts\DocumentContext.tsx`**
   - **Timestamp: 2/20/2026, 10:15:24 AM - 2:06:36 PM**
     - Multiple commits show the introduction and refinement of `refreshDocumentFileUrl` within the `DocumentContext`.
     - Initially, `refreshDocumentFileUrl` was intended to return `Promise<any>`.
     - It was then changed to specifically return `Promise<string | null>`, indicating that only the file URL string is expected.
     - A `useLazyQuery` for `GET_DOCUMENT_FILE_URL_ONLY` was introduced within the context.
     - The `fetchPolicy` for `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID` was initially `network-only`, then temporarily `cache-and-network`, and finally reverted to `network-only`.
     - Crucially, the `fetchPolicy` for `GET_DOCUMENT_FILE_URL_ONLY` was set to `no-cache` with a "VERY IMPORTANT" comment. This is a significant design decision, indicating that fetching just the file URL should bypass the Apollo Client cache entirely to ensure the absolute latest URL is always retrieved, preventing stale data issues, especially in a signing workflow.

**9. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\AllContracts\AllContracts.tsx`**
   - **Timestamp: 2/20/2026, 1:04:07 PM - 1:33:38 PM**
     - These changes are primarily focused on filter persistence and initialization logic using Redux.
     - Several `console.log('FILTER_DEBUG: ...')` statements were added to trace the loading and application of persisted filter values and search queries.
     - The component initializes Redux state from `localStorage` on mount.
     - It then loads and applies persisted search queries, filter states, and filter values to the component's local state, handling cases where persisted data might be empty.
     - A `useRef` named `initializationRef` and state `isInitializing` are used to control the initial load of persisted state and prevent `useEffect` hooks from running prematurely or multiple times.
     - The logic ensures that filters are correctly applied either from persisted state or with default values.
     - `setPendingSearch` and `setIsFiltersApplied` are updated based on persisted Redux state.
     - The `disabledDelete` state logic was updated to differentiate between "check all" and individual selections when determining if documents can be deleted, taking `permissions.deleteDocument` and `agreementStatus` into account.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

- **Timestamp Pattern:** All timestamps fall within February 19-20, 2026, suggesting active development over two consecutive days.
- **GraphQL & Apollo Client Usage:** The application heavily uses GraphQL queries and mutations (`useLazyQuery`, `useMutation`, `gql`) from `@apollo/client` for data fetching and manipulation. This is evident across `Reports.tsx`, `allContractsQueries.ts`, `useDocumentData.ts`, `ContractOverviewRefactored.tsx`, and `DocumentContext.tsx`.
- **Redux State Management:** Redux is used for managing global application state, particularly for persisting filter and search values in the `AllContracts` container. This includes actions like `setAllContractsCurrentPage`, `setAllContractsSearchQuery`, `setAllContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `setAllContractsIsFilterActive`, `setAllContractsPersistedFilterValues`, `clearAllContractsFilterPersistence`, and `initializeAllContractsFromStorage`.
- **Document Management Features:** A consistent theme is the development and refinement of document-related features, including:
    - **Report Generation and Deletion:** `Reports.tsx` handles listing, deleting, and downloading reports.
    - **File Uploads:** `Files.tsx` details complex file upload logic with support for S3 and potentially SharePoint, progress tracking, and duplicate detection.
    - **Contract Overview:** `ContractOverviewRefactored.tsx`, `ContractHeader.tsx`, `useDocumentData.ts`, and `DocumentContext.tsx` focus on displaying contract details, handling external signatories, and managing download links, specifically ensuring the latest file versions are available.
    - **Signature Workflows:** The detailed coordinate handling and backend format conversion in `ContractOverviewRefactored.tsx` point to an active signature placement and management feature.
- **Filter and Search Persistence:** The `AllContracts` component shows a strong pattern of persisting user interface state (search queries, filters, pagination) across sessions using Redux and `localStorage`.
- **Debugging with `console.log`:** Numerous `console.log` statements with prefixes like "FILTER_DEBUG:", "🔍 [useDocumentData]", "📄 [useDocumentData]", "📂 [File URL Refresh]", "🔄 [ContractOverview]" are present across files, indicating active debugging during the development phase. Many of these appear to be temporary additions.
- **Conditional Logic for Features:** There's conditional logic for handling external signatories (`isExternalSignatory`, `isExternalSignatoryAuthenticated`), which affects which GraphQL queries are used and how certain UI elements (like the back button) behave.
- **Modular Component Design:** The use of `memo` for React components (`ContractHeader`, `ContractOverviewContent`, `ContractOverviewInner`) and custom hooks (`useDocumentData`, `useAllContractsUtils`, `useFileManager`, `useContributors`) suggests a modular and performance-conscious development approach.
