## 2:21:39 PM
`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\redux\actions\managerActions\trademarkDashboard\actions.js`
This file, consistently logged from 2/13/2026, 5:49:20 PM to 2/15/2026, 3:39:45 PM, defines Redux actions for trademark management. It includes functions for fetching and posting trademark renewals (`getTmRenewals`, `renewalFiled`). A substantial `getReplyToCorrespondence` function, which contains detailed filtering logic for various trademark attributes (e.g., class, status, proprietor, tags, alerts) and handles both pseudo and non-pseudo requests, remains commented out throughout the provided log, indicating it's either under development or temporarily disabled. The file relies on `Axios` for API calls, Ant Design's `message` for notifications, and `checkAuthorisation` for error handling.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\FilterComponents\FilterSearchBasic.jsx`
This React functional component, managing basic search and filter UI, underwent several changes:
*   **2/13/2026, 5:49:50 PM**: Initial state with search input, a "No Tag" checkbox, a scrollable menu for filter items, and "Active"/"In-Active" checkboxes for `trademarkStatus` filter, initially using `display: "flex"` for layout.
*   **2/15/2026, 11:46:39 AM**: The `getFilterValue` function was updated to support dynamic access based on a `switchValue` prop (`selectedFilters?.[switchValue]?.[key]`).
*   **2/15/2026, 11:49:39 AM**: The change to `getFilterValue` was reverted, returning to direct access (`selectedFilters?.[key]`).
*   **2/15/2026, 3:40:36 PM - 3:42:31 PM**: A series of minor styling adjustments to the `trademarkStatus` checkboxes' container div (removing `display: "flex"`, then `gap`, then `padding`), followed by the entire block being commented out for several consecutive entries.
*   **2/15/2026, 3:42:44 PM**: The `trademarkStatus` checkboxes were uncommented, restoring an earlier styling state with `display: "flex"`, `gap: "10px"`, and `padding`.
*   **2/15/2026, 8:58:58 PM**: The style for the `trademarkStatus` checkboxes' container was updated to `flexDirection: "column"`, arranging them vertically.
*   **2/15/2026, 9:01:14 PM**: A `margin: 0` style was added to the "In-Active" checkbox to refine its spacing.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`
This React class component handles the display and filtering of total trademarks.
*   **2/13/2026, 5:50:22 PM**: Initial state, setting up various filters and managing `ip_india` and `pseudo` trademark data. It fetches dashboard and trademark data on mount.
*   **2/13/2026, 5:50:30 PM**: A bug fix corrected a typo in the `applyFilter` method from `filter_inactive_statu` to `inactive_flag`, which likely prevented proper filtering by inactive status.
Subsequent logs for this file up to 2/15/2026, 12:16:25 PM show no further functional changes.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\managerConstants\trademarkConstants.js`
This file, consistently logged on 2/13/2026, 5:50:42 PM, serves as a configuration hub for default filters and search terms related to trademark management, including general trademarks, hearings, and management actions. No changes were applied to this file during the recorded period.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\Trademark-dashboard.jsx`
This React class component, logged between 2/15/2026, 9:05:19 PM and 2/15/2026, 9:05:49 PM, displays a trademark dashboard with overview cards for total applications, reply to correspondence, and upcoming hearings. It dynamically shows counts based on user subscriptions (e.g., differentiating between IP India and custom pseudo trademark data). An "UPCOMING WEBINAR" modal is present but commented out.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TrademarkDashboardNew.jsx`
*   **2/15/2026, 9:07:21 PM**: This is a newly introduced React functional component that modernizes the trademark dashboard using hooks. It displays summarized trademark information, including various counts (Total, Registered, Active, Inactive), upcoming hearings, and deadline management. It uses `CardBox` and `InfoCard` components for a structured layout and conditionally renders "Renewal (Custom)" based on `PSEUDO_TRADEMARK` subscription. This component signifies a move towards a more modular and hook-based architecture for the dashboard.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\Watch\Pages\GridLayout.jsx`
Logged between 2/16/2026, 11:23:06 AM and 2/16/2026, 11:24:53 AM, this React class component provides a grid layout for viewing trademark threats. It includes state management for expanding records, date ranges, primary and secondary filters, and custom report data. It uses `debounce` for search inputs and handles pagination and fetching threat data asynchronously. No functional changes were recorded for this component in the log.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\Watch\Pages\GridLayout\TMApplied.jsx`
This React class component, logged between 2/16/2026, 11:25:36 AM and 2/16/2026, 11:37:30 AM, is a specialized version of `GridLayout` for "TM Applied" trademarks. It includes refined logic for applying and resetting primary filters, comparing current filters with `lastAppliedFilters` to prevent redundant API calls. It also passes additional threat-related search parameters (`threat_desc_contains_term`, `secondarySearchType`) when expanding records. No functional changes were recorded for this component in the log.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\Watch\Pages\GridLayout\ImageLabel.jsx`
*   **2/16/2026, 11:37:03 AM**: This React class component is another specialized `GridLayout` variant, focusing on "Image Label" functionality. It utilizes specific Redux actions (`GL_getImageLabel`, `GL_getImageLabelTrademarks`) for image-related data fetching and includes `threatLabels` as a filter parameter when fetching threat details for expanded records.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\Watch\watchFilter\newCommonComponent\GridLayout\PrimaryFilter.jsx`
This React functional component, logged between 2/16/2026, 11:26:54 AM and 2/16/2026, 11:45:03 AM, centralizes the primary filter UI and logic for grid layouts. It manages extensive filter states, dynamically constructs filter objects based on URL keys, and integrates with Redux to dispatch data fetching actions. It includes logic for personalized dashboards, handling "select all" for reports, and checking for applied filters. No functional changes were recorded for this component in the log.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\Watch\Pages\GridLayoutDashboard\Components\Content.jsx`
This React functional component displays individual trademark cards within the grid layout.
*   **2/16/2026, 11:39:28 AM**: Initial state, displaying trademark details, an "X Threats" button, and checkboxes for bulk selection.
*   **2/16/2026, 11:40:02 AM**: The threat count `Badge` was temporarily commented out, and the "Threats" button element (`<a>`) was also commented out, suggesting a change in UI interaction.
*   **2/16/2026, 11:55:06 AM**: The "Threats" button was uncommented, but the `Badge` was re-commented.
*   **2/16/2026, 11:55:35 AM**: A significant functional change introduced the `getThreatCount` function to dynamically display threat counts (`personalized_threats_count`, `exclude_personalized_threats_count`, or `constant_last_week_threats`/`last_week_threats`) based on props from a personalized dashboard. The `Badge` for threat count was re-enabled.
*   **2/16/2026, 12:02:50 PM - 1:20:10 PM**: A series of debugging `console.log` statements were added and adjusted within the component, particularly in the `markCollapse` map, to inspect trademark data and threat fields, indicating active troubleshooting during the implementation of personalized threat counts. A bug where `personalized_dashboard` and `exclude_personalized_dashboard` were incorrectly accessed was introduced and subsequently fixed by accessing them from `props`.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**
*   **Frontend Framework**: The project extensively uses React, with a clear shift from class components to functional components utilizing hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useDispatch`, `useSelector`) in newer or updated files like `TrademarkDashboardNew.jsx` and `PrimaryFilter.jsx`.
*   **UI Library**: Ant Design (`antd`) is the primary UI component library, seen across all React components for elements like buttons, inputs, checkboxes, cards, menus, and notifications.
*   **State Management**: Redux is consistently employed for centralized state management, with actions dispatched and state consumed via `connect` or hooks.
*   **API Interaction**: `Axios` is the library of choice for making HTTP requests to a backend API, typically including an `Authorization` header with a token from `localStorage`.
*   **Filtering and Search**: A robust filtering system is a core feature, involving multiple filter criteria, search inputs, date ranges, and dynamic filter application/resetting. The concept of "pseudo" data (custom vs. IP India) is prevalent, affecting data fetching and display.
*   **Error Handling**: Consistent use of `LOADING`, `ERROR`, `SUCCESS` states and Ant Design's `notification` or `message` for user feedback. `checkAuthorisation` is used in Redux actions for authentication errors.
*   **Modularity**: Components are broken down into logical units (e.g., `FilterSearchBasic`, `TotalTrademark`, `TrademarkDashboardNew`, `GridLayout`, `PrimaryGridFilter`, `Content`). Specialized `GridLayout` components exist for different watch types (`TMApplied`, `ImageLabel`).
*   **Styling**: A mix of inline styles and utility-first CSS classes (likely Tailwind CSS, indicated by `cn` utility and class names like `!bg-white/50`, `group-hover:[&_.ant-checkbox-inner]:!border-blue-500`) is used for styling.
*   **Debugging**: Developers frequently add `console.log` statements to trace data flow, especially during the introduction of new features like personalized threat counts.
*   **User Experience**: Features like infinite scrolling (in `FilterSearchBasic`) and tooltips (in `Content.jsx`) aim to enhance usability.
