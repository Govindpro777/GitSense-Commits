# Activity Summary for 2/27/2026

## 2:06:38 PM
The changes log details a series of updates across two files related to managing contract data and filter persistence in a Redux store. All modifications occurred on 2/27/2026.

**File-specific updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\redux\AllContracts\allContractsSlice.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** A continuous series of updates occurred between 9:24:05 AM and 9:26:11 AM.
    *   **Updates:** This file defines the `allContractsSlice` using `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The core state manages filter values, dropdown data, current page, last viewed tab, and the main `allContractsData` (containing documents, agreement types, party names, total documents, pagination details). It also includes states for loading, errors, and filter persistence (`allContractsSearchQuery`, `allContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `allContractsIsFilterActive`, `allContractsPersistedFilterValues`).
    *   Over the reported timestamps, a significant change was the systematic commenting out of logic within several reducers responsible for filter persistence, particularly those that involved `localStorage` operations (e.g., `localStorage.setItem`, `localStorage.removeItem`) and the corresponding Redux state updates. Initially, the `localStorage` interactions were commented out, then the state update logic within `clearAllContractsFilterPersistence`, `setAllContractsPersistedFilterValues`, `setAllContractsIsFilterActive`, and `setAllContractsIsFiltersApplied` reducers were commented out, and finally, these actions were removed or commented out from the `export` statement for the slice's actions. The `initializeAllContractsFromStorage` reducer and its export were also commented out from the start.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\AllContracts\AllContracts.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Two specific updates at 9:49:29 AM and 9:49:37 AM.
    *   **Updates:** This React component, `AllContracts`, uses `react-redux` to interact with the `allContractsSlice` state. It imports and uses various actions and selectors. The updates here directly reflect the changes in the Redux slice:
        *   Several imported Redux actions related to filter persistence (`setAllContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `setAllContractsIsFilterActive`, `setAllContractsPersistedFilterValues`, `clearAllContractsFilterPersistence`, `initializeAllContractsFromStorage`) were commented out from the import statement.
        *   An `useEffect` hook designed to initialize Redux state from `localStorage` using `initializeAllContractsFromStorage` was commented out.
        *   Another `useEffect` block, intended for persisting filter values to Redux, was adjusted. Although the `useEffect` itself was present, the internal `dispatch(setAllContractsPersistedFilterValues(filterValues));` call remained commented out, with an explicit comment stating `// persistence disabled: do not dispatch persisted filter values to Redux`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The primary pattern evident across both files is the **systematic disabling or deprecation of a filter persistence feature**. This involved commenting out `localStorage` interactions, state updates, reducer logic, and action exports in the Redux slice, and subsequently commenting out related imports and dispatch calls in the consuming React component. The presence of numerous `FILTER_DEBUG` comments (albeit commented out) in both files indicates that this feature was under active development or debugging before being disabled. All changes are concentrated within a short period on the same day, suggesting a focused effort to remove or modify this specific functionality.
