# Activity Summary for 2/24/2026

## 1:33:31 PM
The code change log primarily details updates across several React components within an IP Suite web application, with a strong focus on manager functionalities and search features. Most changes occurred on February 23rd and 24th, 2026, indicating focused development periods.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\TodoList.jsx` (Multiple timestamps on 2/23/2026, from 12:42 PM to 5:47 PM)**
    *   **Initial Pagination Implementation:** The component was enhanced to include pagination for the to-do list items. This involved adding `currentPage` and `pageSize` to the component's state, implementing logic in the `render` method to slice data for the current page (`paginatedData`), and integrating the Ant Design `Pagination` component.
    *   **Pagination Refinements:** Numerous iterations were made to the pagination setup. Initially, `pageSize` was set to `9`, then later consistently adjusted to `12` in the state. The `Pagination` component's `pageSize` in the `onChange` handler was temporarily hardcoded to `100` before being reverted to use the state's `pageSize` variable. The `showSizeChanger` and `showTotal` props were toggled and refined.
    *   **Filter/Sort Interaction with Pagination:** Logic was added to reset the `currentPage` to `1` when either the "Show Expired Task" checkbox (`selectExpiredTask`) or the "Sort By" priority dropdown (`handleChangePriority`) is changed. This ensures the pagination resets when filters are applied.
    *   **Conditional Pagination Rendering:** The `Pagination` component's rendering was made conditional on `todoData.length > 0`, ensuring it only appears when there are tasks to paginate.
    *   **`componentDidMount` call simplification:** The initial `getToDoTask` call in `componentDidMount` was simplified from specifying parameters (`"Pending", "All", this.state.currentPage, this.state.pageSize`) to a more general `this.props.getToDoTask()`.
    *   **Layout Adjustment:** The `Pagination` component was moved outside the `Card`'s body and wrapped in a `Row` with `justify="center"` for better visual centering and spacing, with margin adjustments. There was also a temporary phase where the entire `Pagination` component, and even the surrounding `Layout` wrapper, were commented out, then re-introduced and refined.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\ImageSearch.jsx` (2/23/2026, 1:04 PM - 1:05 PM)**
    *   No substantial functional changes were recorded between the two timestamps. The component maintains its purpose of handling image search, including filter management, report generation, and integration with Redux and Ant Design.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\TrademarksSearch.jsx` (2/23/2026, 1:05 PM - 1:06 PM)**
    *   Similarly, no significant functional changes were found. This component remains responsible for various trademark search algorithms, filter handling, report actions, and integration of an `introJs` tour.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\DeadlineManagement.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:09 PM - 3:10 PM)**
    *   No notable functional changes were committed in this timeframe. The component continues to manage the main deadline dashboard, handling different trademark types (portfolio vs. opposed), active tabs, and filter application, along with IP Drafting integration.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\commonComponents\trademarkProfile\DeadlineContent.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:12 PM - 3:32 PM)**
    *   No significant functional changes. This component displays trademark data within a table format, providing actions like viewing profiles, showing reasons for notices, downloading documents, sending emails, and updating "reply filed" or "not my client" statuses.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\components\DeadlineContent.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:12 PM)**
    *   No significant functional changes. This component likely serves a similar role to the one in `commonComponents/trademarkProfile`, displaying paginated and filtered trademark data. It includes detailed column filtering, row selection, and actions.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\CreateTask.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:33 PM - 3:41 PM)**
    *   **Improved `applicationNumber` handling:** A key change was implemented in `componentDidUpdate`. When the `applicationNumber` prop changes, the component now not only updates its internal `trademarksData` state but also explicitly sets the value of the `associated_trademarks` form field using `this.props.form.setFieldsValue`. This ensures better synchronization between props and the form input.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\index.jsx` (2/23/2026, 6:10 PM - 6:12 PM)**
    *   **Sentry Re-activation:** The Sentry error tracking integration, which was previously commented out, was re-enabled. This indicates that error monitoring for the application has been reactivated.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx` (2/24/2026, 10:30 AM - 10:53 AM)**
    *   No major functional changes were recorded. This component manages the display and filtering of total trademarks for manager dashboards.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Ant Design (antd) Usage:** All reviewed files extensively leverage Ant Design components for building the UI, including `Layout`, `Row`, `Col`, `Card`, `Button`, `Typography`, `Checkbox`, `Select`, `Empty`, `notification`, `Pagination`, `Table`, `Modal`, `Input`, `Radio`, `DatePicker`, `Switch`, `Dropdown`, `Menu`, `Tooltip`, `Badge`, `Alert`, `Spin`, `InputNumber`, and `Space`, `Image`.
*   **Redux for State Management:** A consistent pattern of using Redux for application-wide state management is evident, with components either `connect`ing to the Redux store or utilizing `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks. `deepFreeze` is used in `mapStateToProps` for immutability.
*   **Common Utilities:** Frequent imports and usage of common utility functions and constants, such as `logOut`, `getEmailTemplateData`, `LOADING`, `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, and `checkValue`, point to a well-structured and modular codebase.
*   **Filtering and Pagination:** Complex filtering and pagination mechanisms are a recurring theme, especially in the `TodoList` and `TotalTrademark` components, highlighting data presentation and interaction as a key area of development.
*   **Manager-Specific Features:** A significant portion of the changes are concentrated in `managerComponents`, suggesting ongoing development and refinement of tools for managing tasks, deadlines, and trademark information.
*   **Code Review/Refinement Cycle:** The timestamps within individual files, particularly `TodoList.jsx`, show multiple rapid changes, often involving minor adjustments or re-introductions of previously removed features (like pagination), indicating an iterative development and review process.
*   **Error Reporting and Analytics:** The re-activation of Sentry in `index.jsx` confirms an emphasis on monitoring application health and user behavior.

## 2:13:16 PM
The changes log shows a series of updates primarily focused on the contract management features and system configuration within the MikeLegal CLM frontend. All significant changes occurred on **February 24, 2026**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesComponent\FilesGridItem2.tsx` (11:23:32 AM)**: A new React component, `FilesGridItem2`, was introduced. It displays individual contract files with options to select, edit (permission-gated), download, and delete (permission-gated) them. The component uses `antd`'s `Checkbox` and custom icons for actions.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesComponent\FilesGridItem.tsx` (11:24:15 AM)**: The existing `FilesGridItem` React component was updated or refined. Similar to `FilesGridItem2`, it displays file details (name, upload date, uploader) and provides selection, edit (permission-gated), download, and delete (permission-gated) functionalities. The layout differs slightly from `FilesGridItem2`, employing a "card" structure.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\utils\allContractsQueries.ts` (11:36:29 AM - 1:17:39 PM)**: This file, containing GraphQL queries and mutations for contracts, underwent several minor revisions and a significant addition.
    *   Initially, it defined comprehensive queries like `GET_DOCUMENTS` (with extensive filtering capabilities), `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID`, `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID_EXT`, and mutations such as `DELETE_DOCUMENTS`, `UPLOAD_DOCUMENT`, and `REPLACE_DUPLICATE_DOCUMENT`. It also included queries for dashboard data points (`GET_ALL_CONTRACTS_DATA_POINTS`) and filter dropdown values (`GET_ALL_CONTRACTS_DROPDOWN_VALUES`).
    *   **At 11:51:20 AM**, a new export `contractMutations` was added. This object encapsulated simpler `UPLOAD_DOCUMENT` and `DELETE_DOCUMENTS` mutations, potentially for specific use cases or a different mutation pattern. The content of the main queries remained largely stable throughout the series of updates to this file.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\ContractsGrid\AllContractsGrid.tsx` (11:54:43 AM)**: The `AllContractsGrid` React component, responsible for displaying all contracts in a table, was significantly updated.
    *   It now supports expanding rows to show linked agreements in a nested table, with new state variables `expandedRowKeys` and `linkedTablePagination`.
    *   Linked agreement details are displayed with dedicated columns (`linkedAgreementColumns`) including upload date, document name (with a clickable link to `ContractOverview`), link type, execution status (using `Badge` components for styled status indicators), agreement status, and various dates.
    *   The main contract table (`columns`) includes checkboxes for bulk selection, a document name column with `FileText` icon and a visual indicator for `linkedAgreementsCount` to toggle nested rows, and filterable columns for `Type of Agreement` and `Parties` using `FiltersDropdown`. Dynamic styling and navigation logic are also implemented.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\ContractsGrid\AllContractsGridItem.tsx` (12:10:43 PM)**: This component, likely a grid item for contracts, was refined. It displays contract details such as file name (linked to `ContractOverview`), type of agreement, parties, execution date, start date, end date, and consideration. It includes checkboxes for selection and applies dynamic styling based on `agreementStatus` and `status` values.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\types\contracts.ts` (12:27:14 PM)**: New TypeScript interfaces were defined or expanded, including `Contract`, `FilteredContractsData` (detailing various filter options and document properties like `partyList`), and `ContractsGridProps` (defining the props for contract grid components, emphasizing data, filtering, and selection capabilities).
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\types\contracts.ts` (12:37:27 PM)**: This file saw a substantial update, introducing a comprehensive set of TypeScript interfaces for the shared contract data model. This includes `PartyType`, `CalendarEntryType`, `DocumentContributorType`, `LinkType` (an enum for agreement link types), `LinkedAgreementType`, and a highly detailed `DocumentType` interface. The `DocumentType` now includes fields for file processing status (`isProcessing`, `isUploaded`, `isUploading`, `uploadProgress`), as well as `linkedAgreementHistory` and helper functions (`parseLinkedAgreementHistory`).
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Calendar\CalendarCreateNote.tsx` (1:22:10 PM)**: A new `CalendarCreateNote` React component was added. It provides a drawer interface for users to create notes associated with calendar events. It uses an `Editor` component for input, integrates with a GraphQL mutation (`ADD_CALENDAR_NOTE`), handles loading states, error display, and updates the calendar data upon successful note creation.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\config\index.ts` (1:34:34 PM - 1:38:06 PM)**: This configuration file underwent a series of toggles between production and staging environment settings.
    *   Initially, it was configured for production URLs and Digio credentials.
    *   From **1:34:56 PM to 1:37:18 PM**, the configuration was switched to use staging URLs for all services (`clmapi-staging.mikelegal.com`, `docchatapi-staging.mikelegal.com`, etc.) and Digio sandbox credentials. Notably, the `clientId` was retained from the production setup while `MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_ID` was changed for staging.
    *   **At 1:38:06 PM**, the configuration was reverted to the production settings, commenting out the staging block.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) Focus:** The changes overwhelmingly revolve around functionalities critical for a CLM system: displaying, filtering, managing, and interacting with contract documents and their metadata.
*   **React and Ant Design:** The frontend components heavily utilize React and `antd` for building user interfaces, including tables, checkboxes, drawers, and form elements.
*   **GraphQL API Interaction:** Communication with the backend is consistently handled via GraphQL, using `@apollo/client` for queries and mutations related to contracts and calendar notes. This suggests a robust, structured API.
*   **TypeScript for Data Modeling:** Extensive use of TypeScript interfaces across both application and shared libraries enforces strong typing and clearly defines complex data structures for contracts, parties, linked agreements, and other related entities.
*   **Permission-Based Actions:** Critical actions like editing and deleting documents are consistently gated by user permissions, indicating a focus on access control.
*   **Environment Configuration Management:** The repeated toggling of environment-specific URLs and credentials in `shared/src/lib/config/index.ts` highlights a development pattern where engineers frequently switch between production and staging environments for testing or deployment.
*   **Date Formatting:** `dayjs` and standard JavaScript `Date` object methods are used consistently for formatting and displaying dates.
