# Activity Summary for 2/24/2026

## 1:33:31 PM
The code change log primarily details updates across several React components within an IP Suite web application, with a strong focus on manager functionalities and search features. Most changes occurred on February 23rd and 24th, 2026, indicating focused development periods.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\TodoList.jsx` (Multiple timestamps on 2/23/2026, from 12:42 PM to 5:47 PM)**
    *   **Initial Pagination Implementation:** The component was enhanced to include pagination for the to-do list items. This involved adding `currentPage` and `pageSize` to the component's state, implementing logic in the `render` method to slice data for the current page (`paginatedData`), and integrating the Ant Design `Pagination` component.
    *   **Pagination Refinements:** Numerous iterations were made to the pagination setup. Initially, `pageSize` was set to `9`, then later consistently adjusted to `12` in the state. The `Pagination` component's `pageSize` in the `onChange` handler was temporarily hardcoded to `100` before being reverted to use the state's `pageSize` variable. The `showSizeChanger` and `showTotal` props were toggled and refined.
    *   **Filter/Sort Interaction with Pagination:** Logic was added to reset the `currentPage` to `1` when either the "Show Expired Task" checkbox (`selectExpiredTask`) or the "Sort By" priority dropdown (`handleChangePriority`) is changed. This ensures the pagination resets when filters are applied.
    *   **Conditional Pagination Rendering:** The `Pagination` component's rendering was made conditional on `todoData.length > 0`, ensuring it only appears when there are tasks to paginate.
    *   **`componentDidMount` call simplification:** The initial `getToDoTask` call in `componentDidMount` was simplified from specifying parameters (`"Pending", "All", this.state.currentPage, this.state.pageSize`) to a more general `this.props.getToDoTask()`.
    *   **Layout Adjustment:** The `Pagination` component was moved outside the `Card`'s body and wrapped in a `Row` with `justify="center"` for better visual centering and spacing, with margin adjustments. There was also a temporary phase where the entire `Pagination` component, and even the surrounding `Layout` wrapper, were commented out, then re-introduced and refined.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\ImageSearch.jsx` (2/23/2026, 1:04 PM - 1:05 PM)**
    *   No substantial functional changes were recorded between the two timestamps. The component maintains its purpose of handling image search, including filter management, report generation, and integration with Redux and Ant Design.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\TrademarksSearch.jsx` (2/23/2026, 1:05 PM - 1:06 PM)**
    *   Similarly, no significant functional changes were found. This component remains responsible for various trademark search algorithms, filter handling, report actions, and integration of an `introJs` tour.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\DeadlineManagement.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:09 PM - 3:10 PM)**
    *   No notable functional changes were committed in this timeframe. The component continues to manage the main deadline dashboard, handling different trademark types (portfolio vs. opposed), active tabs, and filter application, along with IP Drafting integration.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\commonComponents\trademarkProfile\DeadlineContent.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:12 PM - 3:32 PM)**
    *   No significant functional changes. This component displays trademark data within a table format, providing actions like viewing profiles, showing reasons for notices, downloading documents, sending emails, and updating "reply filed" or "not my client" statuses.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\components\DeadlineContent.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:12 PM)**
    *   No significant functional changes. This component likely serves a similar role to the one in `commonComponents/trademarkProfile`, displaying paginated and filtered trademark data. It includes detailed column filtering, row selection, and actions.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\CreateTask.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:33 PM - 3:41 PM)**
    *   **Improved `applicationNumber` handling:** A key change was implemented in `componentDidUpdate`. When the `applicationNumber` prop changes, the component now not only updates its internal `trademarksData` state but also explicitly sets the value of the `associated_trademarks` form field using `this.props.form.setFieldsValue`. This ensures better synchronization between props and the form input.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\index.jsx` (2/23/2026, 6:10 PM - 6:12 PM)**
    *   **Sentry Re-activation:** The Sentry error tracking integration, which was previously commented out, was re-enabled. This indicates that error monitoring for the application has been reactivated.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx` (2/24/2026, 10:30 AM - 10:53 AM)**
    *   No major functional changes were recorded. This component manages the display and filtering of total trademarks for manager dashboards.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Ant Design (antd) Usage:** All reviewed files extensively leverage Ant Design components for building the UI, including `Layout`, `Row`, `Col`, `Card`, `Button`, `Typography`, `Checkbox`, `Select`, `Empty`, `notification`, `Pagination`, `Table`, `Modal`, `Input`, `Radio`, `DatePicker`, `Switch`, `Dropdown`, `Menu`, `Tooltip`, `Badge`, `Alert`, `Spin`, `InputNumber`, and `Space`, `Image`.
*   **Redux for State Management:** A consistent pattern of using Redux for application-wide state management is evident, with components either `connect`ing to the Redux store or utilizing `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks. `deepFreeze` is used in `mapStateToProps` for immutability.
*   **Common Utilities:** Frequent imports and usage of common utility functions and constants, such as `logOut`, `getEmailTemplateData`, `LOADING`, `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, and `checkValue`, point to a well-structured and modular codebase.
*   **Filtering and Pagination:** Complex filtering and pagination mechanisms are a recurring theme, especially in the `TodoList` and `TotalTrademark` components, highlighting data presentation and interaction as a key area of development.
*   **Manager-Specific Features:** A significant portion of the changes are concentrated in `managerComponents`, suggesting ongoing development and refinement of tools for managing tasks, deadlines, and trademark information.
*   **Code Review/Refinement Cycle:** The timestamps within individual files, particularly `TodoList.jsx`, show multiple rapid changes, often involving minor adjustments or re-introductions of previously removed features (like pagination), indicating an iterative development and review process.
*   **Error Reporting and Analytics:** The re-activation of Sentry in `index.jsx` confirms an emphasis on monitoring application health and user behavior.

## 2:13:16 PM
The changes log shows a series of updates primarily focused on the contract management features and system configuration within the MikeLegal CLM frontend. All significant changes occurred on **February 24, 2026**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesComponent\FilesGridItem2.tsx` (11:23:32 AM)**: A new React component, `FilesGridItem2`, was introduced. It displays individual contract files with options to select, edit (permission-gated), download, and delete (permission-gated) them. The component uses `antd`'s `Checkbox` and custom icons for actions.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesComponent\FilesGridItem.tsx` (11:24:15 AM)**: The existing `FilesGridItem` React component was updated or refined. Similar to `FilesGridItem2`, it displays file details (name, upload date, uploader) and provides selection, edit (permission-gated), download, and delete (permission-gated) functionalities. The layout differs slightly from `FilesGridItem2`, employing a "card" structure.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\utils\allContractsQueries.ts` (11:36:29 AM - 1:17:39 PM)**: This file, containing GraphQL queries and mutations for contracts, underwent several minor revisions and a significant addition.
    *   Initially, it defined comprehensive queries like `GET_DOCUMENTS` (with extensive filtering capabilities), `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID`, `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID_EXT`, and mutations such as `DELETE_DOCUMENTS`, `UPLOAD_DOCUMENT`, and `REPLACE_DUPLICATE_DOCUMENT`. It also included queries for dashboard data points (`GET_ALL_CONTRACTS_DATA_POINTS`) and filter dropdown values (`GET_ALL_CONTRACTS_DROPDOWN_VALUES`).
    *   **At 11:51:20 AM**, a new export `contractMutations` was added. This object encapsulated simpler `UPLOAD_DOCUMENT` and `DELETE_DOCUMENTS` mutations, potentially for specific use cases or a different mutation pattern. The content of the main queries remained largely stable throughout the series of updates to this file.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\ContractsGrid\AllContractsGrid.tsx` (11:54:43 AM)**: The `AllContractsGrid` React component, responsible for displaying all contracts in a table, was significantly updated.
    *   It now supports expanding rows to show linked agreements in a nested table, with new state variables `expandedRowKeys` and `linkedTablePagination`.
    *   Linked agreement details are displayed with dedicated columns (`linkedAgreementColumns`) including upload date, document name (with a clickable link to `ContractOverview`), link type, execution status (using `Badge` components for styled status indicators), agreement status, and various dates.
    *   The main contract table (`columns`) includes checkboxes for bulk selection, a document name column with `FileText` icon and a visual indicator for `linkedAgreementsCount` to toggle nested rows, and filterable columns for `Type of Agreement` and `Parties` using `FiltersDropdown`. Dynamic styling and navigation logic are also implemented.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\ContractsGrid\AllContractsGridItem.tsx` (12:10:43 PM)**: This component, likely a grid item for contracts, was refined. It displays contract details such as file name (linked to `ContractOverview`), type of agreement, parties, execution date, start date, end date, and consideration. It includes checkboxes for selection and applies dynamic styling based on `agreementStatus` and `status` values.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\types\contracts.ts` (12:27:14 PM)**: New TypeScript interfaces were defined or expanded, including `Contract`, `FilteredContractsData` (detailing various filter options and document properties like `partyList`), and `ContractsGridProps` (defining the props for contract grid components, emphasizing data, filtering, and selection capabilities).
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\types\contracts.ts` (12:37:27 PM)**: This file saw a substantial update, introducing a comprehensive set of TypeScript interfaces for the shared contract data model. This includes `PartyType`, `CalendarEntryType`, `DocumentContributorType`, `LinkType` (an enum for agreement link types), `LinkedAgreementType`, and a highly detailed `DocumentType` interface. The `DocumentType` now includes fields for file processing status (`isProcessing`, `isUploaded`, `isUploading`, `uploadProgress`), as well as `linkedAgreementHistory` and helper functions (`parseLinkedAgreementHistory`).
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Calendar\CalendarCreateNote.tsx` (1:22:10 PM)**: A new `CalendarCreateNote` React component was added. It provides a drawer interface for users to create notes associated with calendar events. It uses an `Editor` component for input, integrates with a GraphQL mutation (`ADD_CALENDAR_NOTE`), handles loading states, error display, and updates the calendar data upon successful note creation.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\config\index.ts` (1:34:34 PM - 1:38:06 PM)**: This configuration file underwent a series of toggles between production and staging environment settings.
    *   Initially, it was configured for production URLs and Digio credentials.
    *   From **1:34:56 PM to 1:37:18 PM**, the configuration was switched to use staging URLs for all services (`clmapi-staging.mikelegal.com`, `docchatapi-staging.mikelegal.com`, etc.) and Digio sandbox credentials. Notably, the `clientId` was retained from the production setup while `MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_ID` was changed for staging.
    *   **At 1:38:06 PM**, the configuration was reverted to the production settings, commenting out the staging block.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) Focus:** The changes overwhelmingly revolve around functionalities critical for a CLM system: displaying, filtering, managing, and interacting with contract documents and their metadata.
*   **React and Ant Design:** The frontend components heavily utilize React and `antd` for building user interfaces, including tables, checkboxes, drawers, and form elements.
*   **GraphQL API Interaction:** Communication with the backend is consistently handled via GraphQL, using `@apollo/client` for queries and mutations related to contracts and calendar notes. This suggests a robust, structured API.
*   **TypeScript for Data Modeling:** Extensive use of TypeScript interfaces across both application and shared libraries enforces strong typing and clearly defines complex data structures for contracts, parties, linked agreements, and other related entities.
*   **Permission-Based Actions:** Critical actions like editing and deleting documents are consistently gated by user permissions, indicating a focus on access control.
*   **Environment Configuration Management:** The repeated toggling of environment-specific URLs and credentials in `shared/src/lib/config/index.ts` highlights a development pattern where engineers frequently switch between production and staging environments for testing or deployment.
*   **Date Formatting:** `dayjs` and standard JavaScript `Date` object methods are used consistently for formatting and displaying dates.

## 2:34:06 PM
The provided log details code changes across several React components within a larger application, focusing on `managerComponents` and `searchComponents`. Several changes involve fine-tuning UI behavior, data fetching, and filter application, with a noticeable pattern of iterative adjustments and re-adjustments to pagination and filtering logic.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\TodoList.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 12:53:18 PM (Initial state):** This file provides a UI for a to-do list, displaying tasks with priority and status. It supports adding, deleting, and downloading tasks, as well as filtering by expired status and priority. It uses Redux for state management and Ant Design components for the UI, including a `Pagination` component with a default page size of 9.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 12:53:30 PM:** A `Pagination` component was explicitly added to the layout to manage the display of `todoTask` data.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 1:08:39 PM:** The `Pagination` component was significantly modified to use a fixed `pageSize` of 100, disable `showSizeChanger`, add `showQuickJumper` and `showTotal` functionality, and implement a check to prevent page changes while data is loading.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 1:18:30 PM - 1:19:21 PM:** Many of the pagination changes introduced earlier were reverted. The `pageSize` reverted to a state-managed value (initial 9, later 12), `showSizeChanger` was restored, and the loading check in `onChange` was removed. There was also a minor change converting a `Row` wrapper for pagination to a `div` and back to `Row`.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 1:45:45 PM - 1:55:45 PM:** There were multiple rapid changes involving commenting out and uncommenting large sections of the UI, including the entire content `Card` and the `Pagination` component, suggesting intensive debugging or testing cycles.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 2:11:10 PM - 2:38:20 PM:** The filtering logic in `selectExpiredTask` and `handleChangePriority` was adjusted. Initially, `this.props.getToDoTask()` was called without a `taskStatus` parameter when showing non-expired tasks with "All" priority. This was then reverted to explicitly pass `taskStatus: "Pending"`, and then reverted back again. This indicates ongoing refinement of filter behavior.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 2:41:08 PM:** The default `pageSize` in the component's state was changed from 9 to 12.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 2:42:19 PM:** The `Pagination` component's `current` prop was updated to reset to the first page (`1`) if the current page would fall outside the bounds of the total data length. A `key` prop was also added to the `Pagination` component at **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 2:45:25 PM** to force re-render upon data changes, improving its reliability.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 5:47:23 PM - 5:47:47 PM:** Logic was added to reset `currentPage` to 1 in `handleChangePriority` and `selectExpiredTask` whenever these filters are applied, ensuring the user starts on the first page of the newly filtered results.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\ImageSearch.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 1:04:46 PM (Initial state):** This component (`TrademarksSearch` within `ImageSearch.jsx` due to a naming discrepancy) handles image search functionalities. It uses Redux for search results, report generation, and filter management. It also sets the search path to `/search/image_search` on component mount.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\TrademarksSearch.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 1:05:58 PM (Initial state):** This component implements a more complex trademark search, supporting various algorithms (e.g., Boolean, Fuzzy, Wildcard, Prefix, Suffix) and handling cancellation tokens for Axios requests. It integrates `introJs` for guided tours and includes enhanced filter management components (`SelectContainer`, `DateFilterContainer`). It dynamically fetches filters based on the active search algorithm and manages different search log IDs for multi-word vs. single-word searches.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 6:10:37 PM (Initial state):** The Sentry error tracking and Mixpanel analytics initialization code was commented out.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 6:12:55 PM:** The Sentry and Mixpanel initialization code was uncommented, re-enabling error reporting and user behavior analytics for the application. Sentry is configured for tracing and user context, while Mixpanel uses different tokens for staging and production environments.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\DeadlineManagement.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 3:09:05 PM (Initial state):** This component provides a "Deadline Management" dashboard. It uses React hooks, Redux for fetching dashboard data and filters, and manages various state related to active tabs, trademark status, settings, and IP Drafting. It dynamically generates filters and fetches data based on user selections and subscription types (e.g., "Your Trademark" vs. "3rd Party Opposed Trademark", and custom/pseudo trademarks).

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\commonComponents\trademarkProfile\DeadlineContent.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 3:12:18 PM (Initial state):** This component renders the content within the Deadline Management dashboard. It handles actions like managing notes, sending emails, marking replies filed, and identifying "not my client" cases. It dynamically renders table columns based on the `filing_document_type` and includes complex logic for displaying time remaining, alerts, and document links.
    *   **Timestamp 2/24/2026, 2:06:19 PM:** Updated email `subscription` and `objectType` parameters to be dynamic based on `finalChangeSwitch` (pseudo/real trademark). Also, corrected the column title from "DATE OF LOAD" to "DATE OF UPLOAD".

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\components\DeadlineContent.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 3:12:37 PM (Initial state):** Similar in name but distinct from the previous `DeadlineContent.jsx`, this component also manages deadline content display. It features row selection with "Deselect All Data" functionality, detailed table column filters (e.g., by classes, opponent, tags, dates, status, proprietor) that integrate with Redux for fetching filter options. It makes email subscription and object type dynamic based on whether it's a renewal or pseudo-trademark.

8.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\CreateTask.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 3:33:43 PM (Initial state):** This component provides a modal form for creating or editing to-do tasks. It allows setting priority, title, description, associating emails, trademarks, and patents, and assigning a due date and reminders. It interacts with Redux actions for task and reminder management.
    *   **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 3:37:09 PM:** Enhanced `componentDidUpdate` to not only update internal state (`trademarksData`) but also to explicitly set the form input field (`associated_trademarks`) when an `applicationNumber` prop is provided. A minor refinement at **Timestamp 2/23/2026, 3:41:52 PM** added a conditional check for `applicationNumber` existence before updating.

9.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 2/24/2026, 10:30:01 AM (Initial state):** This component displays a list of all trademarks, handling filtering, searching, and pagination. It supports both IP India and pseudo trademarks, with a switch to toggle between them. It includes functionality for downloading reports, managing notes, sending emails, and navigating to detailed trademark/proprietor profiles. Filters can be applied via URL query parameters on mount.
    *   **Timestamp 2/24/2026, 10:32:18 AM - 10:48:30 AM:** Minor refactoring and cleanup in the `resetFilter` method, consolidating the default filter settings.
    *   **Timestamp 2/24/2026, 10:53:20 AM:** A bug fix was applied to the `handleNextpage` function to ensure the `filterFlag` is correctly passed to the `getTrademark` action when paginating through filtered results.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **2/23/2026, 12:53:30 PM:** Introduction of Ant Design `Pagination` to `TodoList.jsx`.
*   **2/23/2026, 1:08:39 PM:** Major changes to `TodoList.jsx` pagination logic (fixed page size, loading checks).
*   **2/23/2026, 1:18:30 PM:** Reversion of `TodoList.jsx` pagination to more flexible settings.
*   **2/23/2026, 1:53:23 PM:** Temporary removal of main layout wrappers in `TodoList.jsx`.
*   **2/23/2026, 2:11:10 PM - 2:38:20 PM:** Repeated toggling of `TodoList.jsx` filtering logic for "Pending" tasks.
*   **2/23/2026, 2:42:19 PM & 2:45:25 PM:** Critical fixes for `TodoList.jsx` pagination to handle out-of-bounds pages and force re-renders.
*   **2/23/2026, 3:09:05 PM:** Initial implementation of `DeadlineManagement.jsx`, a new dashboard with dynamic content and IP Drafting integration.
*   **2/23/2026, 3:12:18 PM & 3:12:37 PM:** Initial implementation of two `DeadlineContent.jsx` components (one for `trademarkProfile` and one for `components`), introducing complex table rendering, filter integration, and action handling.
*   **2/23/2026, 3:37:09 PM:** Enhancement in `CreateTask.jsx` to pre-fill form fields based on props.
*   **2/23/2026, 5:47:23 PM & 5:47:47 PM:** UX improvement in `TodoList.jsx` to reset pagination on filter changes.
*   **2/23/2026, 6:12:55 PM:** Re-enabling of Sentry and Mixpanel for error tracking and analytics across the application.
*   **2/24/2026, 10:30:01 AM:** Initial implementation of `TotalTrademark.jsx`, a dashboard for managing trademarks with extensive filtering and action capabilities.
*   **2/24/2026, 2:06:19 PM:** Dynamic updates for email subscriptions and object types in `DeadlineContent.jsx` based on pseudo-trademark status.
*   **2/24/2026, 10:53:20 AM:** Bug fix in `TotalTrademark.jsx` for pagination with filters.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Ant Design:** The entire application heavily relies on Ant Design for its UI components, providing a consistent look and feel across different dashboards and modals.
*   **Redux for State Management:** All major components (`TodoList`, `ImageSearch`, `TrademarksSearch`, `DeadlineManagement`, `DeadlineContent`, `CreateTask`, `TotalTrademark`) are connected to Redux, indicating a centralized state management architecture. Actions like `getToDoTask`, `logOut`, `getSearchResults`, `getDashboard`, `getTrademark`, and `getEmailTemplateData` are frequently dispatched.
*   **Iterative UI/UX Refinement:** There's a clear pattern of continuous tweaking and sometimes reverting UI-related logic, particularly for `Pagination` and filtering mechanisms in `TodoList.jsx`. This suggests an active development process focused on improving user interaction and data presentation.
*   **Dynamic Content and Filtering:** Components like `DeadlineManagement` and `TotalTrademark` demonstrate dynamic content loading and extensive filtering capabilities, adapting to user subscriptions, URL parameters, and filter selections.
*   **Modals for Actions:** Modals are consistently used for task creation (`CreateTask`), notes (`ManagerNotes`), email composition (`SendEmailNew`), and report generation (`DownloadReportModal`), centralizing user interactions for these features.
*   **`checkValue` Utility Function:** The `checkValue()` helper function is ubiquitous, used across almost all components to safely access potentially `null` or `undefined` values, preventing runtime errors.
*   **Manager Dashboard Focus:** A significant number of changes occur within `managerComponents`, indicating active development and enhancement of manager-specific dashboards and tools for tasks, deadlines, and trademark management.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Use of `deepFreeze` for Redux state, `lodash.debounce` for event handling (`ImageSearch`, `TrademarksSearch`, `TotalTrademark`), and `useMemo` in functional components (`DeadlineManagement`) points to efforts in optimizing application performance.
*   **Analytics and Error Tracking:** The re-enabling of Sentry and Mixpanel suggests a focus on understanding user behavior and maintaining application stability in production and staging environments.

## 3:13:23 PM
The changes primarily involve the development and refinement of contract-related components and GraphQL operations within a frontend application, along with frequent toggling of environment configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesComponent\FilesGridItem2.tsx` (Timestamp: 2/24/2026, 11:23:32 AM)**:
    This file defines the `FilesGridItem2` React component, designed to display a contract file in a grid layout. It includes a checkbox for selection, displays the file name, and provides action buttons for editing, downloading, and deleting files. These actions are conditionally rendered based on user permissions (`edit_contract_document`, `delete_contract_document`).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\FilesComponent\FilesGridItem.tsx` (Timestamp: 2/24/2026, 11:24:15 AM)**:
    This file defines the `FilesGridItem` React component, which also renders a contract file, but with a different visual layout compared to `FilesGridItem2`. It presents file information in a card-like structure, including date of upload, uploaded by, and action buttons (Edit, Download, Delete) that are permission-gated, similar to `FilesGridItem2`. The component's structure suggests it's an alternative or older grid item rendition.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\utils\allContractsQueries.ts` (Significant change at 2/24/2026, 11:51:20 AM)**:
    This file is a central repository for GraphQL queries and mutations related to contract management. It defines:
    *   `GET_DOCUMENTS`: A comprehensive query to fetch a list of documents with extensive filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities. It includes details like agreement status, linked agreements, and permissions.
    *   `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID` and `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID_EXT`: Queries to fetch detailed information for a single document, covering metadata, URLs, party lists, contributors, calendar entries, and linked agreements. `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID_EXT` appears to be a subset of `GET_DOCUMENT_BY_ID`, omitting certain linked contract and permission details.
    *   `DELETE_DOCUMENTS`: A mutation to delete documents, which can be specified by ID or by filter criteria.
    *   `UPLOAD_DOCUMENT` and `REPLACE_DUPLICATE_DOCUMENT`: Mutations for uploading new documents and replacing existing duplicate ones, including handling duplicate detection results.
    *   `GET_ALL_CONTRACTS_DATA_POINTS` and `GET_ALL_CONTRACTS_DROPDOWN_VALUES`: Queries for dashboard metrics and dropdown filter options, respectively.
    *   A significant update was the introduction of a `contractMutations` object (`11:51:20 AM`), which bundles simplified `UPLOAD_DOCUMENT` and `DELETE_DOCUMENTS` mutations, possibly indicating the introduction of alternative or streamlined API endpoints for these operations.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\ContractsGrid\AllContractsGrid.tsx` (Timestamp: 2/24/2026, 11:54:43 AM)**:
    This React component (`AllContractsGrid`) renders a dynamic table of contracts with advanced features. It supports pagination, filtering via various dropdowns (date, type of agreement, parties, consideration range), and includes checkboxes for bulk selection. A notable feature is the ability to expand rows to view linked agreements in a nested table, complete with their own status badges and date formatting. It leverages Ant Design `Table` and custom utility functions for styling and data display.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\ContractsGrid\AllContractsGridItem.tsx` (Timestamp: 2/24/2026, 12:10:43 PM)**:
    This component (`AllContractsGridItem`) provides a granular view for a single contract, likely used in a non-table grid layout. It displays key contract details such as file name, type of agreement, parties, various dates (execution, start, end), consideration, and agreement status. It includes a checkbox for individual selection and links to a detailed "ContractOverview" page. The presence of `console.log('data', data);` indicates recent debugging or development activity.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\types\contracts.ts` (Timestamp: 2/24/2026, 12:27:14 PM)**:
    This file defines crucial TypeScript interfaces (`Contract`, `FilteredContractsData`, `ContractsGridProps`) for contract-related data structures and component properties within the `MikeCLM` application. These interfaces ensure type safety and consistency across the application's contract management features.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\types\contracts.ts` (Timestamp: 2/24/2026, 12:37:27 PM)**:
    This file establishes core, shared TypeScript interfaces that describe various entities involved in contract management, such as `PartyType`, `CalendarEntryType`, `DocumentContributorType`, `LinkType` (an enum), and `LinkedAgreementType`. Most importantly, it defines the comprehensive `DocumentType` interface, which encapsulates all possible attributes of a contract document, including permissions, history, and status flags. It also includes utility types and a parser function for handling linked agreement history.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Calendar\CalendarCreateNote.tsx` (Timestamp: 2/24/2026, 1:22:10 PM)**:
    This component provides functionality to add notes to specific calendar dates. It features a drawer-based UI with an editor for note input, uses a GraphQL mutation (`ADD_CALENDAR_NOTE`) to persist data, and dynamically updates the calendar state upon successful note creation. Error handling and input validation are also implemented.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\config\index.ts` (Multiple timestamps between 2/24/2026, 1:34:34 PM and 1:38:06 PM)**:
    This configuration file defines various API endpoints and client IDs for different services (CLM API, DocChat, Account, Auth, Management, Digio). The log shows repeated modifications where the configuration is toggled between a production environment setup and a staging environment setup by commenting and uncommenting large blocks of code.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **Between 2/24/2026, 1:34:34 PM and 1:38:06 PM**: Frequent switching between production and staging environment configurations in `shared\src\lib\config\index.ts`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component Development and Refinement**: There's an ongoing effort to build and refine React components for displaying contract files (`FilesGridItem`, `FilesGridItem2`) and a comprehensive contract grid (`AllContractsGrid`, `AllContractsGridItem`).
*   **GraphQL API Interaction**: Heavy reliance on GraphQL for data fetching and mutations, with complex queries and type definitions (`allContractsQueries.ts`, `shared\src\lib\types\contracts.ts`).
*   **TypeScript for Type Safety**: Consistent use of TypeScript interfaces to define data structures and component props, indicating a strong emphasis on type safety and code maintainability across the frontend and shared libraries.
*   **Environment Configuration Toggling**: Repeated modifications to `shared\src\lib\config\index.ts` show a pattern of manually switching between production and staging API endpoints and client IDs. This suggests active development, testing, and deployment preparation for different environments.
*   **Date and Status Formatting**: Multiple components utilize `dayjs` and helper functions like `toTitleCase` for consistent date and status display.
*   **Permissions Handling**: Action buttons and features are frequently gated by permissions (`file?.permissions`), indicating a robust authorization system.

## 3:34:18 PM
The log primarily details extensive development and refactoring within React components, with a strong focus on UI/UX improvements, data filtering, and state management, particularly for "to-do" tasks and "deadline management" functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\TodoList.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup and Core Functionality (2/23, 1:08 PM)**: This component was established as a Redux-connected class component, managing a list of to-do tasks. It included features for adding, editing (via `CreateTask` modal), deleting single tasks, deleting all tasks, downloading task files, and displaying tasks with priority-based color coding. Filtering by "Expired" status and "Priority" (All, High, Medium, Low) was implemented, along with basic pagination.
    *   **Pagination Refinements (2/23, 1:18 PM - 2:52 PM)**: A significant portion of changes involved the `Pagination` component. Initially, a custom `onChange` handler with loading checks and a fixed `pageSize` of 100 was present. This quickly evolved to use Ant Design's `showSizeChanger` with `pageSizeOptions` (2/23, 1:18 PM), which was then removed, then re-added. There were several structural changes involving the `Pagination` component's wrapping `Row` and `div` elements, along with temporary commenting out of the entire pagination block, indicating active UI debugging or restructuring. The initial `pageSize` in the component's state was changed from 9 to 12 (2/23, 2:38 PM, 2:41 PM). A `key` prop was added to the `Pagination` component for forced re-rendering (2/23, 2:45 PM), and the `current` page logic was made more robust to reset to page 1 if the current page would exceed the total data length (2/23, 2:52 PM).
    *   **Filtering Logic Adjustments (2/23, 2:11 PM & 5:34 PM)**: The logic within `selectExpiredTask` and `handleChangePriority` was simplified. When "Show Expired Task" is unchecked and priority is set to "All," the component now fetches all tasks instead of explicitly filtering for "Pending" tasks.
    *   **UX Improvements for Filtering (2/23, 5:47 PM)**: `currentPage: 1` was added to the state updates within `handleChangePriority` and `selectExpiredTask`. This ensures that when a user applies a priority or expired task filter, the displayed tasks automatically reset to the first page, providing a more intuitive user experience.
    *   **Debugging/Temporary Code Modifications (2/23, 1:41 PM - 1:55 PM, 5:35 PM, 5:38 PM)**: Various segments of the UI, including the main task display area, the `<Empty />` component, and the `mapStateToProps` function, were temporarily commented out or truncated and then restored. This suggests active debugging, experimentation with different rendering approaches, or partial commits.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\DeadlineManagement.jsx`**
    *   This file, a functional component utilizing React Hooks, remained largely stable across multiple timestamps (2/23, 3:09 PM - 3:10 PM). It serves as a high-level container for trademark deadline management, dynamically setting initial states based on the URL, fetching data via Redux, and orchestrating various filters and modals (like IP drafting). No significant code changes were introduced within the provided log for this specific file.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\commonComponents\trademarkProfile\DeadlineContent.jsx`**
    *   **Column Title Correction (2/24, 2:06 PM)**: A minor but consistent change was applied to a table column title, updating "TIME REMAINING | DATE OF UPLOAD" to "TIME REMAINING | DATE OF LOAD". This suggests a standardization of terminology.
    *   This component focuses on displaying detailed trademark information within a profile, including dynamic columns for opponent details, reasons for notice, and time-sensitive documents, along with actions like creating tasks and sending emails.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\components\DeadlineContent.jsx`**
    *   **Column Title Correction (2/24, 2:06 PM)**: Similar to the `trademarkProfile` variant, this file also had the "TIME REMAINING | DATE OF UPLOAD" column title updated to "TIME REMAINING | DATE OF LOAD", indicating a synchronized naming convention change across related components.
    *   **State Variable Refactoring (2/24, 2:35 PM & 2:49 PM)**: A brief refactoring attempt involved renaming `selectedApplicationNumber` to `selectedAppNo` while introducing a new `selectedApplicationNumber`, which was later reverted by removing `selectedAppNo`. This indicates an iterative process for managing state.
    *   This component provides a detailed table view for deadline management, featuring comprehensive filtering capabilities, robust row selection with "Deselect All" functionality, and various action buttons for managing tasks, notes, and communications.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\CreateTask.jsx`**
    *   **Form Pre-filling and Reset Logic (2/23, 3:37 PM - 2/24, 2:49 PM)**: The `componentDidUpdate` method saw multiple iterations regarding pre-filling the "Associated Trademarks" field when opening the task creation modal. Initially, it updated state and form fields directly using an `applicationNumber` prop (2/23, 3:37 PM). This logic was then removed (2/24, 2:24 PM) and subsequently re-introduced in a refactored manner, using a new `initialAppNumber` prop and adding logic to explicitly reset the `trademarksData` state when the modal closes (2/24, 2:38 PM). This demonstrates an effort to ensure correct and clean form initialization and reset behavior.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\index.jsx`**
    *   **Sentry Integration Activation (2/23, 6:12 PM)**: The previously commented-out Sentry error tracking initialization block was uncommented. This change activates error reporting and performance monitoring for the application, including environment, release, sampling rate, and user-specific tags (`userName`, `userEmail`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Ant Design UI Framework**: All `.jsx` files extensively use Ant Design components and icons, demonstrating a consistent reliance on this UI library for building the application's interface.
*   **Redux for State Management**: The application architecture is heavily Redux-based, with components using `connect` or hooks (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) to interact with a centralized state, dispatch actions, and consume state data.
*   **Common Utility Functions**: The `checkValue` function is a recurring pattern, indicating a robust approach to handling potentially null or undefined data before rendering.
*   **Modular Modals**: Several functionalities, like creating tasks, adding manager notes, sending emails, and managing replies/client status, are implemented using reusable modal components.
*   **Filtering and Pagination Logic**: Both the `TodoList` and `DeadlineManagement` sections demonstrate complex filtering and pagination logic, which underwent multiple iterations to refine behavior and user experience.
*   **Iterative Development and Debugging**: The frequent small changes, temporary commenting out of code blocks, and minor refactorings throughout the logs suggest an active, iterative development and debugging process for these UI components.
*   **Date Handling**: `moment.js` is used for date formatting and handling within the `CreateTask` component, specifically for due dates.
*   **Session Storage for Context**: `sessionStorage` is consistently used to maintain context (e.g., `proprietor_id`, `management_trademark_id`) across different views or profiles within the application.

## 11:22:10 PM
The log details extensive modifications across two files, primarily `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\AllContracts\AllContracts.tsx` and `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\redux\AllContracts\allContractsSlice.ts`. All changes occurred on **February 24, 2026**, within a concentrated timeframe between 5:54:50 PM and 6:26:19 PM, suggesting a focused effort on a specific refactoring task.

The central theme of these changes is the systematic commenting out and removal of a filter persistence mechanism, particularly related to the `AllContracts` feature.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\AllContracts\AllContracts.tsx`**:
    *   References to Redux state for filter application status (`allContractsIsFiltersApplied`), filter activity status (`allContractsIsFilterActive`), and persisted filter values (`allContractsPersistedFilterValues`) are commented out from the `useSelector` hook.
    *   Several `useState` declarations for `isInitializing`, `isResetting`, `isFilterActive`, `hasPendingChanges`, and `searchQuery` are commented out over different timestamps. The `initializationRef` using `useRef` is also commented out.
    *   The `useEffect` hooks responsible for loading persisted state from Redux, updating component state based on Redux changes, and handling initial data loads with persisted filters are significantly altered. Large blocks of code that previously handled setting component state from persisted Redux values (e.g., `setSearchQuery`, `setIsFiltersApplied`, `setIsFilterActive`, applying `persistedFilterValues` via `handleFilterChange`) are commented out.
    *   The conditional logic within the initial data load `useEffect` that checked `hasPersistedState` is progressively commented out, effectively disabling the differential loading based on persisted filters.
    *   The `useEffect` responsible for persisting filter values to Redux (`dispatch(setAllContractsPersistedFilterValues(filterValues))`) is also commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\redux\AllContracts\allContractsSlice.ts`**:
    *   In the `initialState`, the properties `allContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `allContractsIsFilterActive`, and `allContractsPersistedFilterValues` are commented out.
    *   The corresponding Redux reducers/actions (`setAllContractsIsFiltersApplied`, `setAllContractsIsFilterActive`, `setAllContractsPersistedFilterValues`) are entirely commented out.
    *   Within the `clearAllContractsFilterPersistence` reducer, the `localStorage.removeItem` calls for these specific filter persistence keys are commented out, as are their state resets in the return object.
    *   The `initializeAllContractsFromStorage` reducer also has its `localStorage.getItem` and parsing logic for these filter persistence states commented out.
    *   The exports for the commented-out filter persistence actions are also removed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The most prominent pattern is the systematic disablement of filter persistence. This is evidenced by:
1.  **Consistent commenting out**: The exact same variable names and Redux actions related to filter persistence (`isFiltersApplied`, `isFilterActive`, `persistedFilterValues`, etc.) are commented out across both the React component and its corresponding Redux slice.
2.  **Removal of Local Storage interactions**: Logic for reading from and writing to `localStorage` for these filter states is commented out in `allContractsSlice.ts`.
3.  **Debugging comments**: Frequent `FILTER_DEBUG` console log statements appear, often adjacent to the commented-out persistence logic, indicating that these changes were part of a debugging or feature removal/refactoring process.
4.  **State Simplification**: Beyond filter persistence, several local states related to initialization and reset within `AllContracts.tsx` (`isInitializing`, `isResetting`, `initializationRef`) are also commented out, suggesting a broader simplification of the component's lifecycle management, likely in conjunction with disabling filter persistence.
