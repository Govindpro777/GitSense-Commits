# Activity Summary for 2/24/2026

## 1:33:31 PM
The code change log primarily details updates across several React components within an IP Suite web application, with a strong focus on manager functionalities and search features. Most changes occurred on February 23rd and 24th, 2026, indicating focused development periods.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\TodoList.jsx` (Multiple timestamps on 2/23/2026, from 12:42 PM to 5:47 PM)**
    *   **Initial Pagination Implementation:** The component was enhanced to include pagination for the to-do list items. This involved adding `currentPage` and `pageSize` to the component's state, implementing logic in the `render` method to slice data for the current page (`paginatedData`), and integrating the Ant Design `Pagination` component.
    *   **Pagination Refinements:** Numerous iterations were made to the pagination setup. Initially, `pageSize` was set to `9`, then later consistently adjusted to `12` in the state. The `Pagination` component's `pageSize` in the `onChange` handler was temporarily hardcoded to `100` before being reverted to use the state's `pageSize` variable. The `showSizeChanger` and `showTotal` props were toggled and refined.
    *   **Filter/Sort Interaction with Pagination:** Logic was added to reset the `currentPage` to `1` when either the "Show Expired Task" checkbox (`selectExpiredTask`) or the "Sort By" priority dropdown (`handleChangePriority`) is changed. This ensures the pagination resets when filters are applied.
    *   **Conditional Pagination Rendering:** The `Pagination` component's rendering was made conditional on `todoData.length > 0`, ensuring it only appears when there are tasks to paginate.
    *   **`componentDidMount` call simplification:** The initial `getToDoTask` call in `componentDidMount` was simplified from specifying parameters (`"Pending", "All", this.state.currentPage, this.state.pageSize`) to a more general `this.props.getToDoTask()`.
    *   **Layout Adjustment:** The `Pagination` component was moved outside the `Card`'s body and wrapped in a `Row` with `justify="center"` for better visual centering and spacing, with margin adjustments. There was also a temporary phase where the entire `Pagination` component, and even the surrounding `Layout` wrapper, were commented out, then re-introduced and refined.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\ImageSearch.jsx` (2/23/2026, 1:04 PM - 1:05 PM)**
    *   No substantial functional changes were recorded between the two timestamps. The component maintains its purpose of handling image search, including filter management, report generation, and integration with Redux and Ant Design.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Routes\TrademarksSearch.jsx` (2/23/2026, 1:05 PM - 1:06 PM)**
    *   Similarly, no significant functional changes were found. This component remains responsible for various trademark search algorithms, filter handling, report actions, and integration of an `introJs` tour.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\DeadlineManagement.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:09 PM - 3:10 PM)**
    *   No notable functional changes were committed in this timeframe. The component continues to manage the main deadline dashboard, handling different trademark types (portfolio vs. opposed), active tabs, and filter application, along with IP Drafting integration.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\commonComponents\trademarkProfile\DeadlineContent.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:12 PM - 3:32 PM)**
    *   No significant functional changes. This component displays trademark data within a table format, providing actions like viewing profiles, showing reasons for notices, downloading documents, sending emails, and updating "reply filed" or "not my client" statuses.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\deadlineManagement\components\DeadlineContent.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:12 PM)**
    *   No significant functional changes. This component likely serves a similar role to the one in `commonComponents/trademarkProfile`, displaying paginated and filtered trademark data. It includes detailed column filtering, row selection, and actions.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\to-do-task\CreateTask.jsx` (2/23/2026, 3:33 PM - 3:41 PM)**
    *   **Improved `applicationNumber` handling:** A key change was implemented in `componentDidUpdate`. When the `applicationNumber` prop changes, the component now not only updates its internal `trademarksData` state but also explicitly sets the value of the `associated_trademarks` form field using `this.props.form.setFieldsValue`. This ensures better synchronization between props and the form input.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\index.jsx` (2/23/2026, 6:10 PM - 6:12 PM)**
    *   **Sentry Re-activation:** The Sentry error tracking integration, which was previously commented out, was re-enabled. This indicates that error monitoring for the application has been reactivated.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\managerComponents\trademark\YourTrademak\TotalTrademark.jsx` (2/24/2026, 10:30 AM - 10:53 AM)**
    *   No major functional changes were recorded. This component manages the display and filtering of total trademarks for manager dashboards.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Ant Design (antd) Usage:** All reviewed files extensively leverage Ant Design components for building the UI, including `Layout`, `Row`, `Col`, `Card`, `Button`, `Typography`, `Checkbox`, `Select`, `Empty`, `notification`, `Pagination`, `Table`, `Modal`, `Input`, `Radio`, `DatePicker`, `Switch`, `Dropdown`, `Menu`, `Tooltip`, `Badge`, `Alert`, `Spin`, `InputNumber`, and `Space`, `Image`.
*   **Redux for State Management:** A consistent pattern of using Redux for application-wide state management is evident, with components either `connect`ing to the Redux store or utilizing `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks. `deepFreeze` is used in `mapStateToProps` for immutability.
*   **Common Utilities:** Frequent imports and usage of common utility functions and constants, such as `logOut`, `getEmailTemplateData`, `LOADING`, `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, and `checkValue`, point to a well-structured and modular codebase.
*   **Filtering and Pagination:** Complex filtering and pagination mechanisms are a recurring theme, especially in the `TodoList` and `TotalTrademark` components, highlighting data presentation and interaction as a key area of development.
*   **Manager-Specific Features:** A significant portion of the changes are concentrated in `managerComponents`, suggesting ongoing development and refinement of tools for managing tasks, deadlines, and trademark information.
*   **Code Review/Refinement Cycle:** The timestamps within individual files, particularly `TodoList.jsx`, show multiple rapid changes, often involving minor adjustments or re-introductions of previously removed features (like pagination), indicating an iterative development and review process.
*   **Error Reporting and Analytics:** The re-activation of Sentry in `index.jsx` confirms an emphasis on monitoring application health and user behavior.
