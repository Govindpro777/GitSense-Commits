# Activity Summary for 2/12/2026

## 12:06:13 AM
The provided log primarily details changes to styling and minor code adjustments within two files.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    Across all timestamps from 2/11/2026, 10:30:42 PM to 2/11/2026, 11:14:42 PM, the content of this TypeScript React component appears identical. The code defines a `Files` component responsible for displaying and managing contract documents, including features like search, sort, pagination, file and directory uploads (with progress tracking and conflict resolution), and file downloads. It uses Ant Design components, integrates with a shared `useFileManager` hook, Redux for user data, and makes API calls to retrieve S3 signed URLs for file operations. No discernible functional or structural changes are present in the provided snippets for this file.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\files.scss`**
    This SCSS file underwent multiple iterations of styling adjustments, primarily focused on the `.files-pagination` section.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:39:35 PM:** The pagination container initially included `flex-wrap: wrap;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:39:55 PM:** The `flex-wrap: wrap;` property was commented out.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:41:33 PM:** `overflow-x: auto;` was added to `.files-pagination`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:41:46 PM:** This changed to `overflow-y: auto;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:42:14 PM:** The `overflow` property was removed entirely, reverting to the previous state.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:16 PM:** `padding: 12px;` was added to `.files-pagination`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:27 PM:** A typo was introduced: `padding-: 12px;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:35 PM:** The typo was corrected to `padding-left: 12px;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:47 PM:** The `padding-left` property was removed.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:48:49 PM:** Significant styling for Ant Design pagination components was added, specifically increasing `font-size` to `14px` for pagination items, navigation buttons, and options/total text.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:50:32 PM:** This pagination styling was momentarily commented out and then re-added, functionally preserving the changes from 10:48:49 PM.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:51:10 PM:** The detailed Ant Design pagination styling was removed, reverting the `.files-pagination` block to its simpler form.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:54:53 PM:** Pagination styling was re-introduced, specifically setting `color: var(--grey-8);` and `font-size: 12px;` for `.ant-pagination-total-text` nested under `.ant-pagination`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:58:46 PM:** Further refinements were made to Ant Design pagination items, setting `min-width: 28px;`, `height: 28px;`, `line-height: 26px;`, and `font-size: 13px;` for `.ant-pagination-item`, `.ant-pagination-prev`, and `.ant-pagination-next`. The `font-size` for `total-text` remained `12px`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 11:52:11 PM:** The `font-size` for `.ant-pagination-item`, `.ant-pagination-prev`, and `.ant-pagination-next` was adjusted from `13px` to `12px`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Pagination Styling Iterations:** The `.scss` file shows a consistent focus on refining the appearance and layout of the pagination component (`.files-pagination`) and its nested Ant Design elements. This included experimenting with `overflow` properties, padding, and specific font/size adjustments for various pagination parts, suggesting an iterative design and styling process to achieve the desired look and responsiveness.
*   **Identical TSX Snippets:** The recurring identical content for `Files.tsx` suggests either very frequent saves of the file without functional changes, or that the provided log snippets for this file are partial and do not capture any actual code modifications if they occurred. It indicates that the primary development activity captured in this log revolved around styling rather than the core logic of the React component.

## 1:02:52 AM
The provided logs detail changes to the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\Chatbot\WorkflowIntroModal.jsx` across multiple timestamps on 2/11/2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The file `WorkflowIntroModal.jsx` defines a React component responsible for displaying an introductory modal about "Workflows" in the "MikeLegal" application. This modal outlines a four-step process for creating, selecting, and running workflows, with associated text and SVG images. It also includes a `oneTimeModal` function to manage whether the modal has been viewed by a specific user (based on `user_id` in `localStorage`).

The main changes center around how a "Magic Icon" is handled:

*   **Initial State (2/11/2026, 8:44:51 PM):** The component imports `Magic` from a local assets directory (`./assets/magic.svg`) and references an undefined `MagicIcon`. The "Magic Icon" is rendered using a direct `<img>` tag with the `Magic` SVG for all instances.
*   **Significant Change (2/11/2026, 8:45:12 PM):** The import `MagicIcon` is replaced with `import MagicIconSVG from '../../assets/MagicIconSVG';`. This indicates a shift towards using a dedicated React component for the icon instead of a raw SVG path. However, the actual usage within the `workflowModalData` array and the main modal introduction text still used the old `<img>` tag with `Magic` SVG.
*   **Further Refinement (2/11/2026, 8:46:40 PM):** The `MagicIconSVG` component is adopted within the `stepText` for the third workflow step in `workflowModalData`, replacing the `<img>` tag.
*   **Minor Adjustment (2/11/2026, 8:46:47 PM):** A minor formatting adjustment is made to the rendering of `<MagicIconSVG />` in the third workflow step, removing an unnecessary space.
*   **Subsequent Entries (2/11/2026, 8:46:54 PM and 2/11/2026, 8:48:43 PM):** These timestamps show no functional code changes; the content is identical to the previous entry, suggesting save operations without modifications.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2/11/2026, 8:45:12 PM:** Introduced `MagicIconSVG` component import.
*   **2/11/2026, 8:46:40 PM:** First usage of the `MagicIconSVG` component in the `workflowModalData`.
*   **2/11/2026, 8:46:47 PM:** Minor formatting correction to the `MagicIconSVG` usage.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**
The overall pattern observed is a transition from using direct SVG image paths (`<img src={Magic} alt="Magic Icon" />`) to a more component-based approach (`<MagicIconSVG />`) for rendering specific icons. This suggests an effort towards better code organization, reusability, or potentially more advanced styling/interactivity for the "Magic Icon." However, this refactoring was not fully completed across all instances of the icon within the file during these changes, as the introductory section of the modal still referenced the `Magic` SVG directly at the end of the log.
