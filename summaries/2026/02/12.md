## 12:06:13 AM
The provided log primarily details changes to styling and minor code adjustments within two files.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    Across all timestamps from 2/11/2026, 10:30:42 PM to 2/11/2026, 11:14:42 PM, the content of this TypeScript React component appears identical. The code defines a `Files` component responsible for displaying and managing contract documents, including features like search, sort, pagination, file and directory uploads (with progress tracking and conflict resolution), and file downloads. It uses Ant Design components, integrates with a shared `useFileManager` hook, Redux for user data, and makes API calls to retrieve S3 signed URLs for file operations. No discernible functional or structural changes are present in the provided snippets for this file.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\files.scss`**
    This SCSS file underwent multiple iterations of styling adjustments, primarily focused on the `.files-pagination` section.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:39:35 PM:** The pagination container initially included `flex-wrap: wrap;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:39:55 PM:** The `flex-wrap: wrap;` property was commented out.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:41:33 PM:** `overflow-x: auto;` was added to `.files-pagination`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:41:46 PM:** This changed to `overflow-y: auto;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:42:14 PM:** The `overflow` property was removed entirely, reverting to the previous state.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:16 PM:** `padding: 12px;` was added to `.files-pagination`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:27 PM:** A typo was introduced: `padding-: 12px;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:35 PM:** The typo was corrected to `padding-left: 12px;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:47 PM:** The `padding-left` property was removed.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:48:49 PM:** Significant styling for Ant Design pagination components was added, specifically increasing `font-size` to `14px` for pagination items, navigation buttons, and options/total text.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:50:32 PM:** This pagination styling was momentarily commented out and then re-added, functionally preserving the changes from 10:48:49 PM.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:51:10 PM:** The detailed Ant Design pagination styling was removed, reverting the `.files-pagination` block to its simpler form.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:54:53 PM:** Pagination styling was re-introduced, specifically setting `color: var(--grey-8);` and `font-size: 12px;` for `.ant-pagination-total-text` nested under `.ant-pagination`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:58:46 PM:** Further refinements were made to Ant Design pagination items, setting `min-width: 28px;`, `height: 28px;`, `line-height: 26px;`, and `font-size: 13px;` for `.ant-pagination-item`, `.ant-pagination-prev`, and `.ant-pagination-next`. The `font-size` for `total-text` remained `12px`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 11:52:11 PM:** The `font-size` for `.ant-pagination-item`, `.ant-pagination-prev`, and `.ant-pagination-next` was adjusted from `13px` to `12px`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Pagination Styling Iterations:** The `.scss` file shows a consistent focus on refining the appearance and layout of the pagination component (`.files-pagination`) and its nested Ant Design elements. This included experimenting with `overflow` properties, padding, and specific font/size adjustments for various pagination parts, suggesting an iterative design and styling process to achieve the desired look and responsiveness.
*   **Identical TSX Snippets:** The recurring identical content for `Files.tsx` suggests either very frequent saves of the file without functional changes, or that the provided log snippets for this file are partial and do not capture any actual code modifications if they occurred. It indicates that the primary development activity captured in this log revolved around styling rather than the core logic of the React component.
