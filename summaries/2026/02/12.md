# Activity Summary for 2/12/2026

## 12:06:13 AM
The provided log primarily details changes to styling and minor code adjustments within two files.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    Across all timestamps from 2/11/2026, 10:30:42 PM to 2/11/2026, 11:14:42 PM, the content of this TypeScript React component appears identical. The code defines a `Files` component responsible for displaying and managing contract documents, including features like search, sort, pagination, file and directory uploads (with progress tracking and conflict resolution), and file downloads. It uses Ant Design components, integrates with a shared `useFileManager` hook, Redux for user data, and makes API calls to retrieve S3 signed URLs for file operations. No discernible functional or structural changes are present in the provided snippets for this file.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\files.scss`**
    This SCSS file underwent multiple iterations of styling adjustments, primarily focused on the `.files-pagination` section.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:39:35 PM:** The pagination container initially included `flex-wrap: wrap;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:39:55 PM:** The `flex-wrap: wrap;` property was commented out.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:41:33 PM:** `overflow-x: auto;` was added to `.files-pagination`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:41:46 PM:** This changed to `overflow-y: auto;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:42:14 PM:** The `overflow` property was removed entirely, reverting to the previous state.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:16 PM:** `padding: 12px;` was added to `.files-pagination`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:27 PM:** A typo was introduced: `padding-: 12px;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:35 PM:** The typo was corrected to `padding-left: 12px;`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:43:47 PM:** The `padding-left` property was removed.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:48:49 PM:** Significant styling for Ant Design pagination components was added, specifically increasing `font-size` to `14px` for pagination items, navigation buttons, and options/total text.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:50:32 PM:** This pagination styling was momentarily commented out and then re-added, functionally preserving the changes from 10:48:49 PM.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:51:10 PM:** The detailed Ant Design pagination styling was removed, reverting the `.files-pagination` block to its simpler form.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:54:53 PM:** Pagination styling was re-introduced, specifically setting `color: var(--grey-8);` and `font-size: 12px;` for `.ant-pagination-total-text` nested under `.ant-pagination`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 10:58:46 PM:** Further refinements were made to Ant Design pagination items, setting `min-width: 28px;`, `height: 28px;`, `line-height: 26px;`, and `font-size: 13px;` for `.ant-pagination-item`, `.ant-pagination-prev`, and `.ant-pagination-next`. The `font-size` for `total-text` remained `12px`.
    *   **2/11/2026, 11:52:11 PM:** The `font-size` for `.ant-pagination-item`, `.ant-pagination-prev`, and `.ant-pagination-next` was adjusted from `13px` to `12px`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Pagination Styling Iterations:** The `.scss` file shows a consistent focus on refining the appearance and layout of the pagination component (`.files-pagination`) and its nested Ant Design elements. This included experimenting with `overflow` properties, padding, and specific font/size adjustments for various pagination parts, suggesting an iterative design and styling process to achieve the desired look and responsiveness.
*   **Identical TSX Snippets:** The recurring identical content for `Files.tsx` suggests either very frequent saves of the file without functional changes, or that the provided log snippets for this file are partial and do not capture any actual code modifications if they occurred. It indicates that the primary development activity captured in this log revolved around styling rather than the core logic of the React component.

## 1:02:52 AM
The provided logs detail changes to the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\Chatbot\WorkflowIntroModal.jsx` across multiple timestamps on 2/11/2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The file `WorkflowIntroModal.jsx` defines a React component responsible for displaying an introductory modal about "Workflows" in the "MikeLegal" application. This modal outlines a four-step process for creating, selecting, and running workflows, with associated text and SVG images. It also includes a `oneTimeModal` function to manage whether the modal has been viewed by a specific user (based on `user_id` in `localStorage`).

The main changes center around how a "Magic Icon" is handled:

*   **Initial State (2/11/2026, 8:44:51 PM):** The component imports `Magic` from a local assets directory (`./assets/magic.svg`) and references an undefined `MagicIcon`. The "Magic Icon" is rendered using a direct `<img>` tag with the `Magic` SVG for all instances.
*   **Significant Change (2/11/2026, 8:45:12 PM):** The import `MagicIcon` is replaced with `import MagicIconSVG from '../../assets/MagicIconSVG';`. This indicates a shift towards using a dedicated React component for the icon instead of a raw SVG path. However, the actual usage within the `workflowModalData` array and the main modal introduction text still used the old `<img>` tag with `Magic` SVG.
*   **Further Refinement (2/11/2026, 8:46:40 PM):** The `MagicIconSVG` component is adopted within the `stepText` for the third workflow step in `workflowModalData`, replacing the `<img>` tag.
*   **Minor Adjustment (2/11/2026, 8:46:47 PM):** A minor formatting adjustment is made to the rendering of `<MagicIconSVG />` in the third workflow step, removing an unnecessary space.
*   **Subsequent Entries (2/11/2026, 8:46:54 PM and 2/11/2026, 8:48:43 PM):** These timestamps show no functional code changes; the content is identical to the previous entry, suggesting save operations without modifications.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   **2/11/2026, 8:45:12 PM:** Introduced `MagicIconSVG` component import.
*   **2/11/2026, 8:46:40 PM:** First usage of the `MagicIconSVG` component in the `workflowModalData`.
*   **2/11/2026, 8:46:47 PM:** Minor formatting correction to the `MagicIconSVG` usage.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**
The overall pattern observed is a transition from using direct SVG image paths (`<img src={Magic} alt="Magic Icon" />`) to a more component-based approach (`<MagicIconSVG />`) for rendering specific icons. This suggests an effort towards better code organization, reusability, or potentially more advanced styling/interactivity for the "Magic Icon." However, this refactoring was not fully completed across all instances of the icon within the file during these changes, as the introductory section of the modal still referenced the `Magic` SVG directly at the end of the log.

## 2:18:03 PM
This log details changes across three files, primarily focusing on UI adjustments and the introduction/refinement of workflow features.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\Chatbot\WorkflowIntroModal.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Change (2/11/2026, 8:44:51 PM):** Introduced `WorkflowIntroModal` component, which displays an introductory modal for a "Workflows" feature. It imports several SVG assets, `Button`, `Modal` from `antd`, and `InlineStyled`. The modal's content (`workflowModalData`) outlines four steps for using workflows, including creating a new workflow, opening the workflow tab, selecting a workflow (custom or "MikeLegal's Magic"), and exporting results. A `oneTimeModal` function is defined to manage local storage to show the modal only once per user.
    *   **Consistent Updates (2/11/2026, 8:45:12 PM - 2/12/2026, 9:41:15 AM):** The changes in this timeframe are almost exclusively related to refining the display of the "MikeLegal's Magic" icon within the `workflowModalData` array (specifically step 3) and the modal's introductory text.
        *   Initially, `Magic` (an SVG image) was used inline.
        *   Later, an import for `MagicIconSVG` from `../../assets/MagicIconSVG` was added, and the usage of the Magic icon was progressively changed to `MagicIconSVG` component within `InlineStyled` elements.
        *   There are several minor stylistic adjustments (`alignItems`, `gap`, `display: "inline-flex"`, `whiteSpace: 'nowrap'`) and text formatting (e.g., adding a space before the `InlineStyled` component for "MikeLegal's Magic") to ensure the Magic icon and text are aligned correctly within the modal's instructions.
    *   **Final Change (2/12/2026, 12:37:27 PM):** A minor styling adjustment, removing the `style={{ top: 40 }}` property from the top-level `InlineStyled` component (which wraps the `Modal`) within the `WorkflowIntroModal` component. This indicates that the `top` positioning is now likely handled by the `className` or other parent styles.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\FilePicker\FilePickerDocChat.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Change (2/12/2026, 9:25:02 AM):** This file defines the `FilePickerDocChat` component, which handles document uploads and interaction with a DocChat feature. It includes functionality for uploading single or multiple documents, creating folders, managing quota, and tracking user actions with Mixpanel. It also uses Redux for state management (`docChatQuota`, `uploadStatus`, `message`, etc.) and `react-router-dom` for navigation. It imports `MagicIcon` from `./assets/docchat/MagicIcon`.
    *   **Consistent Updates (2/12/2026, 9:25:11 AM - 2/12/2026, 9:46:34 AM):** The primary and only significant change across these timestamps is the replacement of `MagicIcon` import and usage with `MagicIconSVG`.
        *   The import line `import MagicIcon from '../../assets/docchat/MagicIcon';` was changed to `import MagicIconSVG from '../../assets/MagicIconSVG';`.
        *   The corresponding JSX usage `<MagicIcon />` was updated to `<MagicIconSVG />`.
        *   There are no other functional or substantial stylistic changes within this component across these entries.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\ShowExampleModal\ShowExampleModal.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Change (2/12/2026, 10:17:18 AM):** The file was significantly refactored. The previous implementation (commented out) used a `contentData` array to dynamically render the example steps. The new, active code hardcodes the content for "Step 1: Persona," "Step 2: Task," "Step 3: Context," and "Step 4: Output Format" directly into the JSX. The purpose of this modal is to show an example of how to define a workflow, covering persona, task, context (with nested rules for parties, payment terms, indemnity cap), and output format.
    *   **Minor Adjustments (2/12/2026, 11:08:12 AM - 2/12/2026, 11:21:56 AM):** Minor cosmetic changes involving commenting out or re-adding `style={{ top: 40 }}` and `bodyStyle` properties on the `Modal` component, or commenting out `className={styles.modalWrapper}`. These indicate experimentation with styling placement. Eventually, the `style` prop with `top` and `width` and `ant-modal-content` override for `maxHeight` and `overflowY` was re-added directly.
    *   **Functional Import (2/12/2026, 1:50:22 PM - 2/12/2026, 2:05:11 PM):** An attempt was made to import `useActionState` into the component.
        *   Initially, `const { actionState, setCurrentActionState, resetActionState } = useActionState();` was added outside the component, then moved inside.
        *   The import path for `useActionState` was refined from `'react'` to `'../.'` (likely an incorrect relative path) and finally corrected to `'../../../../CommonFuctions/useActionState'`. This suggests an integration of state management for tracking user interactions or workflow status within this modal, although `actionState` itself is not used in the provided JSX for `ShowExampleModal`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\ShowExampleModal\ShowExampleModal.module.scss`**
    *   **Initial Change (2/12/2026, 10:17:33 AM):** This file defines the SCSS styles for the `ShowExampleModal`. It includes styles for the modal wrapper, content container, individual step blocks, and different list types (bulleted, no-bullet, sub-bullet). Initially, the entire file content was commented out and then uncommented.
    *   **Minor Adjustments (2/12/2026, 11:11:19 AM - 2/12/2026, 11:24:18 AM):** Several minor tweaks to the `modalWrapper` styles:
        *   `top: 40px;` was added.
        *   The `.ant-modal-content` styles (border-radius, padding, maxHeight, overflowY) were duplicated once, then removed from the outer `.modalWrapper` definition and applied directly via global CSS selector `:global(.ant-modal-content)` to ensure application to the Ant Design Modal's internal structure. This indicates an effort to correctly style the Ant Design Modal component's internal elements.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **"Magic Icon" Refactoring:** A consistent pattern across `WorkflowIntroModal.jsx` and `FilePickerDocChat.jsx` is the migration from an inline SVG import (`Magic`) or a local component (`MagicIcon`) to a shared `MagicIconSVG` component imported from a higher-level `../../assets/MagicIconSVG` directory. This suggests a component standardization or refactoring effort to centralize common UI elements.
2.  **Ant Design Modal Styling:** Both `WorkflowIntroModal.jsx` and `ShowExampleModal.jsx` heavily use Ant Design's `Modal` component and involve intricate inline styling or SCSS module styling to customize its appearance, particularly concerning `top` positioning, `width`, `maxHeight`, and `overflowY` of the modal content. There's an iterative process of commenting out and re-adding styles, indicating active development and refinement of modal presentation.
3.  **Workflow Feature Introduction:** The changes clearly show the introduction and detailed explanation of a "Workflows" feature within the application, involving both an introductory modal (`WorkflowIntroModal.jsx`) and a detailed example modal (`ShowExampleModal.jsx`) for defining custom workflows. The workflow steps (Persona, Task, Context, Output Format) are consistently described.
4.  **Local Storage Usage:** The `WorkflowIntroModal.jsx` consistently uses `localStorage.getItem` and `localStorage.setItem` to track if the introductory modal has been shown to a user, ensuring it appears only once.
5.  **Analytics Tracking:** `FilePickerDocChat.jsx` uses `trackButtonClick` from `../../analytics/mixpanel` for various user actions like selecting an option or uploading documents, indicating a focus on user behavior analytics for the DocChat feature.
6.  **Redux Integration:** `FilePickerDocChat.jsx` utilizes Redux (`connect`, `useSelector`) for state management related to document uploads and chat history.
7.  **Minor Stylistic Iterations:** Many commits involve very small, often redundant, or experimental changes to styling, especially within the JSX (e.g., adding/removing `style` attributes, adjusting `display`, `gap`, `alignItems`). This suggests frequent small adjustments during active UI development or debugging.
8.  **Commenting Practices:** The `ShowExampleModal.jsx` and `ShowExampleModal.module.scss` files show a pattern of commenting out old code blocks or styles, which can be indicative of refactoring processes where old code is temporarily kept for reference before being fully removed.

## 2:18:11 PM
The changes primarily focus on frontend components for file management, specifically related to contract documents. There are recurring patterns of iterative refinement in styling, API interaction strategies, and UI element behavior. All changes occurred on February 11th and 12th, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\Files.tsx`**
    *   Across multiple timestamps from 2/11/2026, 10:30:42 PM to 2/12/2026, 12:47:08 PM, the provided code content for this file remained **identical**. The component `Files` is a React functional component responsible for rendering and managing files within a contract context. It handles features like searching, sorting, pagination, file and directory uploads (with progress tracking and status handling like "Uploading," "Completed," "Failed," "Replace"), and selected file downloads. It utilizes `useFileManager` for backend interactions and Ant Design components for UI.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Contracts\Files\files.scss`**
    *   This SCSS file underwent frequent, granular styling adjustments for the file management interface, particularly regarding pagination and action buttons.
    *   **Pagination Styling (2/11/2026, 10:39:55 PM - 2/11/2026, 10:43:47 PM):** Initial changes focused on the `.files-pagination` container's layout (`flex-wrap`, `overflow-x`, `overflow-y`) and then experimented with `padding`, including a brief typo (`padding-:`). These properties were added, changed, and then often removed, suggesting a search for the right layout.
    *   **Pagination Item Sizing (2/11/2026, 10:48:49 PM - 2/12/2026, 12:11:03 AM):** There was an iterative process of adjusting font sizes and dimensions for Ant Design's pagination elements (`.ant-pagination-item`, `.ant-pagination-prev`, `.ant-pagination-next`, `.ant-pagination-options`, `.ant-pagination-total-text`). Initially, font sizes were increased to `14px`, then reverted, then specifically `min-width`, `height`, `line-height`, and `font-size` were set (e.g., `font-size: 13px;` for items, then `12px`). The `.ant-pagination-total-text` also received specific color and font size (`12px`).
    *   **Action Button Spacing and Z-index (2/12/2026, 12:42:53 AM - 2/12/2026, 12:53:38 AM):** The `gap` property for `.files-action` was briefly increased from `18px` to `20px` and then reverted. A `z-index` was added to `.files-action .ant-badge-count`, initially set to `9999 !important` and then adjusted to `2 !important`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\utils\hooks\AllContracts\useFile\useFileManager.ts`**
    *   This file, containing the `useFileManager` custom hook for data fetching and mutations, saw a consistent series of changes revolving around the `deleteFiles` mutation's `onSuccess` and `onMutate` callbacks.
    *   **Delete Mutation Strategy (2/12/2026, 1:15:12 AM - 2/12/2026, 1:25:34 AM):** The `deleteFiles` mutation's strategy for updating the UI after a successful deletion was frequently altered. It cycled through:
        1.  An initial implementation of optimistic updates (`onMutate` to filter local cache), including `queryClient.cancelQueries` and `queryClient.setQueryData`, with a rollback mechanism on error.
        2.  Reversion to simple `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey })` in `onSuccess` (e.g., 2/12/2026, 1:15:54 AM).
        3.  A change to explicitly filtering the cache data within `onSuccess` using the `deletedIds` returned from the API (e.g., 2/12/2026, 1:17:06 AM).
        4.  Reverting again to `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey })` (e.g., 2/12/2026, 1:20:18 AM).
        5.  Switching to `await refetchFiles()` in `onSuccess` to force a full data re-fetch (e.g., 2/12/2026, 1:20:41 AM).
        6.  Final reversion back to `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey })` in `onSuccess` (e.g., 2/12/2026, 1:25:34 AM and onwards).
    *   The `renameFile` mutation consistently uses `queryClient.invalidateQueries` on success and includes specific error handling for "Source file not found." Download mutations (`downloadFile`, `downloadFolder`, `downloadAllFiles`) consistently handle blob responses and trigger success messages.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\UploadProgressBar\UploadProgressBarItem.tsx`**
    *   This component, which displays the progress of individual file uploads, underwent several refinements, particularly concerning the "Cancel" button visibility.
    *   **Cancel Button Logic (2/12/2026, 1:16:27 PM - 2/12/2026, 2:07:51 PM):** A "Cancel" button was added for files with "Uploading" status when `progress > 0`. This condition was then changed to be more restrictive (`progress > 0 && progress < 9`) and then made more permissive again (`progress > 0 && progress < 95`), indicating a process of finding the optimal window for users to cancel an upload.
    *   **"Replace" Status Rendering (2/12/2026, 2:05:23 PM - 2/12/2026, 2:05:31 PM):** The rendering for files with "Replace" status (using a `WarningFilled` icon) was briefly removed and then immediately re-added.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** A strong pattern of rapid iteration and fine-tuning is evident across all modified files. Small changes are made, immediately followed by further adjustments or reversions (e.g., pagination padding, delete mutation strategy, cancel button visibility).
*   **UI/UX Focus:** Many changes are directed at improving the user experience, such as adjusting pagination element sizes for better readability, modifying the visual feedback for upload statuses, and controlling the availability of UI actions like "Cancel" during uploads.
*   **Data Management Strategy:** The `useFileManager.ts` hook demonstrates an ongoing deliberation in managing data state after mutations, particularly for deletions. The shift between optimistic updates, `invalidateQueries`, direct `setQueryData`, and `refetchFiles` highlights a search for the most effective and performant approach.
*   **Ant Design Integration:** The projects heavily use Ant Design components, and many SCSS changes are specifically targeting Ant Design's class names for customization.
*   **Error Handling and Feedback:** Consistent use of `message.success()` for positive user feedback and `handleAxiosError()` for error management is present across API-related code.

## 3:18:05 PM
The provided log details changes across several files, primarily focusing on UI components related to workflow introductions and file picking, and a modal for showing workflow examples.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\Chatbot\WorkflowIntroModal.jsx`
*   **Timestamp:** 2/11/2026, 8:44:51 PM - 2/12/2026, 12:37:27 PM
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Initial Commit (8:44:51 PM):** Introduced a `WorkflowIntroModal` component using Ant Design's `Modal` and a custom `InlineStyled` component. It imports several SVG assets for workflow steps (WorkflowIntroStep11SVG to WorkflowIntroStep4SVG, Magic) and `WORKFLOW_INTRO_MODAL` constant. The modal displays a step-by-step guide to using workflows, including creating new workflows, opening the workflow tab, selecting custom or "MikeLegal's Magic" workflows, and exporting results. A `oneTimeModal` function is defined to set a user's `WORKFLOW_INTRO_MODAL` status in `localStorage` to `false` after clicking "Ok".
    *   **Subsequent Refinements (8:45:12 PM - 9:39:56 AM):** The primary change across these timestamps involves updating the import for `MagicIcon` to `MagicIconSVG` from a common assets path (`../../assets/MagicIconSVG`) instead of a local `MagicIcon` (which was likely `Magic.svg`). This also involved updating the rendering of the Magic icon within the modal's `stepText` and the main introductory text. The icon was initially rendered as `<img src={Magic} alt="Magic Icon" />` and then changed to `<MagicIconSVG />`, with subsequent adjustments to wrap it in `InlineStyled` components for better alignment and styling (e.g., adding `display: "inline-flex", alignItems: "center", gap: "4px"`). The import of `Magic` (the SVG image) remains, but `MagicIconSVG` is used for the component.
    *   **Minor CSS adjustments (9:40:14 AM - 9:40:42 AM):** A small change in the main introduction text for "MikeLegal's Magic" to add a leading space `{' '}` before the `InlineStyled` component.
    *   **Final change (12:37:27 PM):** Removed the `style={{ top: 40 }}` prop directly from the `Modal` component and instead relies solely on the styles defined within `InlineStyled` for positioning, specifically `top: 40, width: '860px !important'`. This suggests an effort to centralize styling.

#### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\FilePicker\FilePickerDocChat.jsx`
*   **Timestamp:** 2/12/2026, 9:25:02 AM - 2/12/2026, 9:46:34 AM
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Initial Commit (9:25:02 AM):** The `FilePickerDocChat` component manages file uploads for a "DocChat" feature, handling file status, selected options (e.g., "MikeLegal's Magic", "Your Workflows"), and navigation. It integrates with Redux for chat history and analytics (Mixpanel) for button clicks. It includes a quota exhaustion message and a modal for creating folders. The "MikeLegal's Magic" button rendered a `MagicIcon` component.
    *   **Icon Update (9:25:11 AM - 9:25:21 AM):** The import `MagicIcon from '../../assets/docchat/MagicIcon'` was changed to `MagicIconSVG from '../../assets/MagicIconSVG'`, and the corresponding usage within the "MikeLegal's Magic" button was updated from `<MagicIcon />` to `<MagicIconSVG />`.
    *   **No functional changes (9:46:01 AM - 9:46:34 AM):** The code content for these timestamps is identical to the previous entry, indicating saving without further modifications.

#### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeDocCompare\src\Features\SettingPage\Workflow\ShowExampleModal\ShowExampleModal.jsx`
*   **Timestamp:** 2/12/2026, 10:17:18 AM - 2/12/2026, 3:12:01 PM
*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Initial Commit (10:17:18 AM):** This file was initially largely commented out, containing a detailed `contentData` array outlining a 4-step workflow example (Persona, Task, Context, Output Format) for a modal. The active code showed a `ShowExampleModal` component using Ant Design's `Modal` to display a hardcoded example structure for these steps.
    *   **Uncommenting/Restructuring (10:17:18 AM):** The bulk of the commented-out `contentData` array was replaced by inline JSX rendering of the same content directly within the modal, removing the dynamic mapping. This effectively hardcoded the example text directly into the component's render method.
    *   **Style Adjustments (11:11:19 AM - 11:21:56 AM):**
        *   Various attempts were made to control the modal's styling, specifically setting `top: 40` and `maxHeight: '90vh', overflowY: 'auto'` for the `ant-modal-content`. This involved moving some `style` props directly to the `Modal` component and then back to the `className` referring to `styles.modalWrapper`, which itself contained the specific `ant-modal-content` overrides using `:global()`. The `width={1000}` was also adjusted or removed and added back. The consistent goal was to ensure the modal is positioned correctly and has scrollable content.
        *   Finalizing the CSS approach by using `className={styles.modalWrapper}` which targets the Ant Design modal's internal structure using `:global(.ant-modal-content)`.
    *   **Redux Integration Attempt (1:50:22 PM - 2:05:11 PM):** An attempt to import and use `useActionState` (likely a custom hook for Redux/state management) was introduced, then corrected in its import path to `../../../../CommonFuctions/useActionState`. The `actionState`, `setCurrentActionState`, and `resetActionState` were destructured, but not actively used in the component's display logic beyond being declared.
    *   **Button Refactoring (3:03:14 PM - 3:12:01 PM):**
        *   The `Close` button in the modal's footer was initially a standard Ant Design `Button`.
        *   It was refactored to use a custom `AppButton` component, requiring a new import `import AppButton from "../../../../CommonComponents/UI/AppButton/AppButton";`.
        *   The `onCancel` prop of the `Modal` was temporarily changed to `resetActionState` (from `onClose`) then reverted to `onClose`, while the `AppButton`'s `onClick` was set to `resetActionState` then reverted to `onClose`. This indicates a brief exploration of how to handle the modal's close action and whether it should trigger state resets directly. The final state ensures `onClose` is passed down consistently.
        *   The import for `useActionState` was removed, indicating it was not ultimately utilized in this component.

*   **Key Changes:**
    *   **Initial Commit (10:17:33 AM):** The SCSS file was initially entirely commented out, mirroring the commented JSX content in the `.jsx` file. This indicates the modal and its styling were under development or temporarily disabled.
    *   **Uncommenting (10:17:33 AM):** The entire content of the SCSS file was uncommented, making the styles active. These styles define the appearance of the modal wrapper (`.modalWrapper`), its content container (`.cardsContainer`), individual step blocks (`.stepBlock`), and various list styles (bulleted, no-bullet, sub-bullet).
    *   **Refinement of Modal Styling (11:11:19 AM - 11:24:18 AM):** Added and refined `top: 40px` and `:global(.ant-modal-content)` to target the Ant Design modal's content area specifically for `border-radius`, `padding`, `max-height`, and `overflow-y` to ensure consistent modal appearance and scrollability. Redundant entries for `ant-modal-content` were also removed or consolidated.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Ant Design Modals:** Both `WorkflowIntroModal.jsx` and `ShowExampleModal.jsx` heavily utilize Ant Design's `Modal` component, often with custom styling applied via `InlineStyled` or SCSS modules to control size, position, and content scrolling.
*   **Workflow-Related Content:** All modified files are part of "Workflow" or "Chatbot" features, specifically related to introducing and explaining workflows to users, or enabling file uploads for document chat with workflow options.
*   **SVG Icons:** The replacement of a simple `<img>` tag with a React component (`MagicIconSVG`) for icons suggests a move towards more modular and potentially styleable SVG usage.
*   **Styling Consistency:** There's a recurring pattern of ensuring modals have `maxHeight: '90vh'` and `overflowY: 'auto'` to prevent content overflow, often adjusted directly or through global Ant Design overrides in SCSS.
*   **`localStorage` Usage:** The `WorkflowIntroModal.jsx` file consistently uses `localStorage` to track whether a user has seen the workflow introduction modal, ensuring it's shown only once per user.
*   **Mixpanel Analytics:** `FilePickerDocChat.jsx` demonstrates a consistent pattern of `trackButtonClick` calls to log user interactions and selections (e.g., "MikeLegal's Magic", "Your Workflows", "Create a Folder").
*   **Commenting/Uncommenting:** A notable pattern in the `ShowExampleModal` files is the initial commenting out of large sections of both JSX and SCSS, followed by uncommenting and minor adjustments. This could indicate a feature being temporarily disabled, a work-in-progress, or a large code block being moved from a data structure to direct JSX.
