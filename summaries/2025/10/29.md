# Activity Summary for 10/29/2025

## 1:05:01 AM
The log entries detail the development and refinement of a reporting module within a backend application, focusing on brand and competitor analysis.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\config.ts` (Timestamp: 10/28/2025, 4:54:33 PM)**
This file defines environment-specific base URLs and image URLs for `development`, `preview`, and `production` modes. The `baseURL` for `preview` and `production` have been updated to `https://beta.goskribe.com` and `https://goskribe.com` respectively, with older `skribeapi-dev/prod` URLs commented out. Utility functions `getBaseURL`, `getImageURL`, and `isProduction` are provided to retrieve these configuration values based on the `Vite` environment mode.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\BrandSummary.tsx` (Timestamps: 10/28/2025, 5:08:40 PM and 5:09:16 PM)**
This React functional component, `BrandSummary`, is designed to display various aggregated brand data points within a monthly report. Although logged twice, the code content is identical, indicating a minor save or reformat. It accepts props like `topPublications`, `topJournalists`, `sentimentScore`, `regionalMention`, and `brandMention`. The component includes several data transformation functions (`transformPublicationsData`, `transformJournalistsData`, `transformRegionalData`, `transformBrandMentionData`, `calculateSentimentScore`, `getSentimentBreakdown`) to process raw data into formats suitable for charts and display. It utilizes `ReactApexChart` to render bar charts for "Top Publications" and donut charts for "Brand Mention" (labeled "Quality Chart") and "Regional Mention." The UI is structured as a `pdf-section` containing a "Brand Summary" header, followed by sections for publications and journalists, applying specific Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx` (Timestamps: 10/28/2025, 5:09:29 PM, 5:10:44 PM, 5:18:28 PM, 5:19:51 PM)**
This file manages the overall Brand Report generation process.
*   **10/28/2025, 5:09:29 PM:** Initial implementation showcasing PDF generation capabilities using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`. It includes a `downloadPDFWithLinks` function that generates a PDF from various report sections, critically adding support for clickable links. A `calculateDateRange` function is defined to determine report periods (1, 3, 6, or 12 full calendar months), consistently using UTC. The `fetchAllApis` function is responsible for concurrently fetching data from different services (`MonthlyReportDetails`, `AIBrandReport`, `BrandMention`) based on selected client, brand, and date range.
*   **10/28/2025, 5:10:44 PM:** An incomplete import for `CompetitorSummary` (`import CompetitorSummary from '../BrandMonthlyReport/';`) was introduced, signaling the intention to add a new section.
*   **10/28/2025, 5:18:28 PM:** The `CompetitorSummary` import path was corrected to `import CompetitorSummary from '../BrandMonthlyReport/CompetitorSummary';`, fully integrating this new component.
*   **10/28/2025, 5:19:51 PM:** A further expansion of the report structure occurred with the addition of `import CompetitorNarratives from '../BrandMonthlyReport/CompetitorNarratives';`.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\CompetitorSummary.tsx` (Timestamps: 10/28/2025, 5:11:28 PM, 5:16:28 PM, 5:17:51 PM)**
This component, intended for competitor summary, initially appears as a direct copy of `BrandSummary.tsx`.
*   **10/28/2025, 5:11:28 PM and 5:16:28 PM:** The component content is identical to `BrandSummary.tsx`, including the component name being `BrandSummary` and the rendered title being "Brand Summary", despite the file path indicating a competitor summary.
*   **10/28/2025, 5:17:51 PM:** A significant refactor occurred. The component name was correctly updated from `BrandSummary` to `CompetitorSummary`, the interface name from `BrandSummaryProps` to `CompetitorSummaryProps`, and the rendered heading within the JSX from "Brand Summary" to "Competitor Summary." The underlying data transformation and charting logic remains consistent with `BrandSummary`, indicating a clear pattern of re-use and adaptation for competitor data visualization.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Modular Reporting Structure:** Reports are built from distinct React components (`UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `Narratives`, `CompetitorSummary`, `CompetitorNarratives`), promoting reusability and maintainability.
*   **Data Visualization Focus:** Heavy reliance on `ReactApexChart` for generating various charts (bar, donut) to visually represent data, along with custom data transformation logic to prepare data for these charts.
*   **PDF Generation:** Consistent use of `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` for client-side PDF report generation, with specific attention to styling fixes and enabling clickable links within the PDF.
*   **Date Handling:** A precise `calculateDateRange` function handles date calculations for report periods, specifically focusing on full calendar months and UTC, suggesting a requirement for accurate period-based reporting.
*   **Configuration for Environments:** A dedicated configuration file ensures flexibility in defining service endpoints and resources for different deployment environments.
*   **Component Duplication and Refactoring:** The development of `CompetitorSummary` by initially copying and then refactoring `BrandSummary` highlights a pattern of adapting existing components for new but similar functionalities.
