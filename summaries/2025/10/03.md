# Activity Summary for 10/3/2025

## 10:31:05 AM
The code changes, all timestamped on 10/3/2025 between 10:04 AM and 10:10 AM, indicate a focused effort on refining reporting functionalities and development environment configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\.prettierrc` (Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 10:04:23 AM)**
    *   This file defines Prettier formatting rules for the project. The configuration specifies: semicolons at the end of statements (`"semi": true`), a tab width of 4 spaces (`"tabWidth": 4`), single quotes for strings (`"singleQuote": true`), and a print width of 200 characters (`"printWidth": 200`). This ensures consistent code style across the project.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx` (Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 10:08:39 AM)**
    *   This file, responsible for generating brand reports, received significant updates, particularly in its PDF generation capabilities.
    *   A new function `downloadPDFWithLinks` was introduced (replacing a commented-out simpler `downloadPDF`), which generates multi-page PDFs using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`. Crucially, this updated function now **captures and adds clickable links** from the HTML content into the generated PDF, enhancing interactivity.
    *   Styling functions (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) were added to temporarily fix display issues for embedded media (images, SVGs, etc.) during PDF generation.
    *   The `calculateDateRange` function was refactored. The previous logic calculated date ranges relative to the current date; the **new logic ensures date ranges correspond to full calendar months**, calculating the end date as the last day of the previous month and start dates relative to that for periods like 1, 3, 6, or 12 months.
    *   The `fetchAllApis` function outlines a comprehensive data fetching strategy for brand reports, making concurrent calls to `/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/AIBrandReport`, and `/BrandMention` endpoints, then populating various state variables with usage, narrative, top publications, journalists, regional mentions, brand mentions, and sentiment scores.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\ClientReportMailer.tsx` (Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 10:10:15 AM)**
    *   This file defines a React component, `EmailTemplate`, used for generating and copying the HTML source of a daily news report email.
    *   It handles the display of articles, grouped by category, with features like formatting publication dates and making article titles clickable links.
    *   A `handlePreviewButtonClick` function allows users to **copy the complete HTML source of the email template to the clipboard**, ready for use in an email client.
    *   The articles are dynamically sorted and grouped by predefined categories, ensuring a structured presentation within the email.
    *   The email template uses extensive inline styling, including a basic media query for mobile responsiveness, which is typical for robust HTML email design.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Report-Centric Development:** A clear pattern emerges around report generation and distribution. Both `BrandReport.tsx` and `ClientReportMailer.tsx` are dedicated to producing different forms of client-facing reports (PDF and email, respectively).
*   **Date and Time Management:** Both reporting files involve specific date handling, with `BrandReport.tsx` focusing on precise date range calculation for full months and `ClientReportMailer.tsx` on date formatting for display.
*   **Backend Integration:** `BrandReport.tsx` demonstrates heavy reliance on a `userService` for fetching data from multiple API endpoints, indicating a structured approach to backend communication for report data.
*   **User Interface Interactivity:** The addition of clickable links in PDFs (`BrandReport.tsx`) and the ability to copy the full HTML email source (`ClientReportMailer.tsx`) highlight a focus on enhancing user interaction and ease of report sharing.

## 10:34:32 AM
The log details changes across three React components within a frontend application, specifically related to brand monitoring and spokesperson articles.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Initial State (10/3/2025, 10:05:08 AM):** This file defines the `ShareofVoice` functional component, serving as a dashboard for brand insights. It initializes state for `mediaType`, `competitor`, and `lastDays` using `useState`. It includes static options for these dropdowns and placeholder data for `brandJournalists` and `competitionJournalists`. The component renders a `BrandHeader`, `MonthShareOfVoice`, `DropdownComponent` for filtering, date input fields, `PieChartSection`, and `TopJournalists`.
    *   **Minor Formatting Change (10/3/2025, 10:07:13 AM):** The code was updated to change all string literals from single quotes (`'`) to double quotes (`"`). There were no functional changes in this update. The entry at 10:05:17 AM shows identical content to the 10:05:08 AM entry, indicating no functional or formatting changes in that specific nine-second interval.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\TopJournalists.jsx`**
    *   **Update (10/3/2025, 10:08:14 AM):** This file introduces the `TopJournalists` functional component, responsible for displaying lists of journalists for both the brand and its competitors. It includes mock data for journalists (e.g., "A Kumar" for brand, "Ravi M." for competition). The component features "Add To CRM" and "Create List" buttons for the competition section. It internally defines and utilizes a `JournalistTable` sub-component to render the data, complete with checkboxes, profile icons, journalist names, outlets, and mention counts.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Spokesperson\Articles.jsx`**
    *   **Update (10/3/2025, 10:09:56 AM):** This file defines the `Articles` functional component, designed to display a paginated list of articles mentioning a spokesperson. It manages state for loading, articles data, total articles, outlet filtering options, and current page. The component fetches data dynamically from a backend API (`SPOKESPERSONARTICLES` and `GET_OUTLET_FILTER_OPTIONS` endpoints) using `userService.post`. It integrates a `MultiSelectDropdown` for outlet filtering and displays selected outlets with a removal option. The articles are rendered using an `ArticleCard` sub-component, showing title, summary, publication date, and sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). Pagination controls are included to navigate through the article list.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/3/2025, 10:05:08 AM**: Establishment of the `ShareofVoice` dashboard component with initial structure and placeholder data.
*   **10/3/2025, 10:07:13 AM**: `ShareofVoice.jsx` undergoes a non-functional formatting change (single to double quotes).
*   **10/3/2025, 10:08:14 AM**: Introduction/update of `TopJournalists.jsx`, setting up the display for brand and competition journalists.
*   **10/3/2025, 10:09:56 AM**: Introduction/update of `Articles.jsx`, implementing dynamic article fetching, filtering, and pagination.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **React Frontend Development:** All changes are within React functional components, indicated by `"use client"` directives and the use of React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
*   **Tailwind CSS for Styling:** The code consistently uses Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g., `w-11/12`, `py-4`, `flex`, `gap-2`, `rounded-lg`, `border`) for layout and styling.
*   **Modular Component Structure:** Components are organized into logical units, with higher-level components (`ShareofVoice`) importing and rendering smaller, specialized components (`MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, `TopJournalists`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`, `ArticleCard`).
*   **State Management:** The `useState` hook is extensively used across components to manage local component state, such as dropdown selections, loading indicators, and data arrays.
*   **Placeholder/Mock Data:** Both `ShareofVoice.jsx` and `TopJournalists.jsx` heavily utilize hardcoded mock data for dropdown options, journalist lists, and article examples, suggesting ongoing development or initial setup before full API integration.
*   **Dropdowns and Filtering:** There's a recurring pattern of using dropdowns (either custom `DropdownComponent` or `MultiSelectDropdown`) to enable filtering and selection of options like media types, number of competitors, date ranges, and article outlets.
*   **API Integration:** The `Articles.jsx` component demonstrates interaction with a backend through a `userService.post` call, using specific API constants for different data fetches.
*   **Pagination:** The `Articles.jsx` component includes client-side pagination logic for managing large datasets.
*   **Code Formatting:** The change in `ShareofVoice.jsx` from single to double quotes for string literals indicates the application of a code formatter or linter across the project.

## 11:19:40 AM
The entire log pertains to a single file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\new365.html`. This file represents an HTML email template for a "Skribe 365 Report" that tracks journalist moves and changes.

**Summary of Changes by Timestamp:**

*   **10/3/2025, 10:33:56 AM:** The initial version of the HTML email template is established. It features a blue gradient background, a central content table with a white background and rounded top corners. The header includes a "Skribe logo," a "Skribe 365 Report" title, and a descriptive paragraph encouraging social media connections (Facebook, Twitter). The main content is divided into sections like "International Affairs," "Business & Economy," and "Health & Wellness," each containing cards detailing journalist updates (name, new role, previous association, contact info, X/Twitter handle) along with a `target.png` image for profiles. A simple footer with social media icons and an unsubscribe link is present.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:40:03 AM:** This entry shows no discernible changes from the previous version, suggesting a minor save or reformat without content alteration.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:42:35 AM (Significant Redesign):** A major overhaul of the template's structure and styling.
    *   The `viewport` meta tag is updated.
    *   The email title changes to "Skribe 365 Report - Journalist Moves and Changes."
    *   A new font, "Source Sans 3," is added, and an internal `<style>` block is introduced for basic body font and a mobile-responsive text utility class.
    *   The main content width is increased from 600px to 700px.
    *   The header section is redesigned with a different linear gradient and rounded bottom corners (`border-radius: 0 0 30px 30px;`).
    *   The Skribe logo image is replaced by a `target.png` icon (80x80px), and the main title gains an emoji ("📊") and larger font size (48px).
    *   The introductory paragraph about the report is moved to be directly under the main title within the header section, and social media links (`x.com` for Twitter) are updated with new styling.
    *   Section headers (e.g., "International Affairs") are restyled with a new blue background and rounded corners.
    *   Journalist profile images are also `target.png` but with new dimensions (70x70px) and `object-fit: cover`.
    *   General text colors and link colors within journalist cards are updated. The footer appears to be truncated in this log entry.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:50:55 AM (Header Refinement and Image Update):** Further stylistic changes are applied.
    *   The email title is updated again to "Skribe 365 Report - Media Industry Updates."
    *   The header is significantly altered to use a background image (`mailerHeader1.png`). The main title font size is reduced to 36px, made uppercase, and letter-spacing is added.
    *   The descriptive paragraph is moved *out* of the header and into a separate `<td>` with a light grey background (`#f8f9fa`).
    *   Section headers are restyled with a darker blue background (`#1E3A5F`) and a different padding/border-radius.
    *   Journalist profile images are changed to `profile.png` (50x50px).
    *   Overall padding and margins are adjusted.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:51:23 AM (Minor Image URL Update):** The background image for the header is updated from `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/mailerHeader1.png` to `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailerimages/header_365.png`.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:54:36 AM (Profile Image Inconsistency):** The profile image sources for "Business Today" and "Fortune India" entries are seemingly reverted back to `target.png`, while others remain `profile.png`.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:55:20 AM:** No observable changes from the previous version, indicating another minor save.

*   **10/3/2025, 11:16:24 AM (Advanced Header & Styling):** Another significant redesign, particularly for the header and section indicators.
    *   New CSS classes (`.header-overlay`, `.curved-bottom`) are introduced for a more complex, visually distinct header.
    *   The header background uses a multi-stop linear gradient and a CSS-based "curved bottom" effect.
    *   A textual "SKRIBE" logo is added to the top-left of the header.
    *   The "Target Icon" is now a purely CSS-styled concentric circle design. The main title is larger (42px) with text shadow.
    *   The main description paragraph is completely separated from the header.
    *   Section headers gain a dynamic blue underline effect using CSS.
    *   Journalist profile images are updated to distinct `profileX.jpg` URLs and are slightly larger (60x60px). Email links within journalist cards lose their `text-decoration` (underline).

*   **10/3/2025, 11:16:35 AM (Partial Reversion/Overwrite):** Many changes from the 11:16:24 AM timestamp are reverted.
    *   The advanced CSS for the header, curved bottom, and CSS-styled target icon are removed.
    *   The header reverts to using the `header_365.png` background image.
    *   Journalist profile images revert to `target.png` for all entries.
    *   The description paragraph is duplicated within the header content `div` *and* in the separate description section.

*   **10/3/2025, 11:18:03 AM:** The duplicated description paragraph from within the header's content overlay `div` is removed, resolving one instance of duplication. However, the description still exists as content within the header's `div` and as a standalone description section.

*   **10/3/2025, 11:18:31 AM:** The duplicated description paragraph from inside the header content `div` is re-introduced, making the content duplication pattern return as seen at 11:16:35 AM.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **File Consistency:** All changes are focused on a single HTML file for an email template, indicating continuous development of this specific asset.
*   **Report Structure:** The core structure of the "Skribe 365 Report" (header, descriptive text, categorized journalist updates, footer) remains consistent across all versions, though its visual implementation evolves.
*   **Journalist Data:** The format and details provided for each journalist update (publication, date, name, role, previous association, contact, social media) are highly consistent.
*   **Image Hosting:** All images are sourced from `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/` or `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`.
*   **Styling Iteration:** There's a clear pattern of iterative design changes, especially around the header and section styling, with multiple significant redesigns followed by minor tweaks or partial reversions. This suggests experimentation or A/B testing of design elements.
*   **Rapid Development:** The timestamps indicate a rapid sequence of modifications within approximately 45 minutes, highlighting active and continuous work on the template.
*   **Content Duplication:** A specific issue related to the introductory paragraph's placement and duplication recurs in the later timestamps, suggesting a challenge in managing that particular content block during layout changes.

## 12:19:43 PM
The provided log details a series of modifications made to a single HTML file, `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\new365.html`, between 10/3/2025, 11:20:43 AM and 10/3/2025, 12:18:32 PM. These changes primarily focus on refining the visual presentation and layout of an email report template.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Header Section:**
    *   **11:25:54 AM:** The header content overlay underwent a significant redesign. The main `<h1>` title was restructured to include a `<span>` for "365 Report", and its font size increased from 36px to 38px. The "Target Icon" image was moved and resized from 90x90px to 55x55px, and placed alongside the title within a new flex container for centering. The header's introductory paragraph text color changed from `#333333` to `#ffffff`, its font size decreased from `16px` to `15px`, and a `max-width: 650px;` was applied.
    *   **11:47:50 AM - 12:06:13 PM:** Further adjustments were made to the header. The `padding-top` of the content overlay was progressively reduced (from 60px to 0px). Social media link colors within the header paragraph were changed from `#4DABFF` to `#ffffff`. A new "Skribe Logo" image (`skribeNew.png`) was introduced above the main heading, which itself underwent several size reductions (from 130x84px down to 70x40px) and had a `margin-bottom: 10px;` added. The main heading and introductory paragraph elements within the header were also adjusted for left-alignment and the paragraph's `max-width` was further tightened (down to `540px`). The background size of the header image was subtly changed to `100% 90%`.
    *   **Color Fickle:** The color of the "365 Report" `<span>` within the `<h1>` saw multiple changes: initially `#1F6FEB`, then matching the main `H1` color `#239DFF`, briefly a `linear-gradient`, and finally settling back to `color: #239DFF;`.

*   **Overall Layout & Background:**
    *   **11:26:17 AM:** A redundant "Description Section" (a duplicate of the header paragraph content) was completely removed.
    *   **11:30:32 AM:** The main content table's background color was updated from `white` to `#E6EEF2`.
    *   **11:34:58 AM & 11:36:15 AM:** Individual news update blocks (e.g., NDTV India, Live Mint) had their explicit `background-color: white;` removed, making them inherit the main `#E6EEF2` background, thus creating a more uniform appearance.

*   **Section Headers (e.g., "International Affairs"):**
    *   **11:26:37 AM:** The background color of the blue labels for content sections changed from `#1E3A5F` to `#074890`.
    *   **11:30:32 AM:** These headers were completely restructured from a single `div` to a `table` layout, featuring a left-aligned blue label (`<h2>` with reduced font-size from 18px to 16px and removed `text-transform: uppercase;`) and a right-extending horizontal line.
    *   **11:31:32 AM - 11:32:19 AM:** Padding was added to the bottom of the section headers, and vertical alignment (`valign="middle"`) was applied to the table cells for better layout control.

*   **Individual News Update Content:**
    *   **11:52:44 AM - 12:13:43 PM:** The styling for specific elements within each news update entry (like NDTV India, Live Mint, Fortune India) was made consistent. The `color` of email addresses (mailto links) changed from `#4DABFF` to `#239DFF`, then uniformly to `#333333`, and finally to `black` across all entries. Similarly, the date (`<span>`) and main paragraph (`<p>`) text within these entries saw their `font-size` reduced to `11px` (for date) and `14px` (for paragraph), and their `color` set to `black`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** The log shows a clear pattern of iterative design and styling refinements, particularly concerning colors, sizes, padding, and alignments, applied across similar elements (e.g., header text, section titles, and individual news items).
*   **Email-Specific HTML:** The consistent use of nested `<table>` elements and inline CSS styling across the entire document indicates that this HTML file is a carefully constructed email template designed for maximum compatibility across various email clients.
*   **Modular Design:** The structure employs recurring content blocks for "International Affairs", "Business & Economy", "Health & Wellness", each with a distinct header and uniform sub-items, suggesting a modular approach to content presentation.
*   **Branding Integration:** Images like `header_365.png`, `target.png`, and `skribeNew.png` are consistently used for branding, with their sizes and positioning adjusted over time.
*   **Color Palette Evolution:** There's a noticeable evolution in the primary blue tones (`#4DABFF` to `#1F6FEB` to `#239DFF`) and the general text/link colors (from various blues and grays to more consistent `#ffffff` for header links and `black` for detailed content links and text).

## 1:19:30 PM
The logs detail continuous development and refinement across two HTML email templates, `new365.html` and `Skribe365.html`, all occurring on 10/3/2025. Both files serve to report on journalist moves and changes within the media industry, categorized by sections like "International Affairs," "Business & Economy," and "Health & Wellness."

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\new365.html` (12:20:22 PM - 1:16:50 PM):**
    *   This file began as a comprehensive HTML email template for a "Skribe 365 Report - Media Industry Updates".
    *   **Initial Design (12:20:22 PM):** Featured a prominent header with a background image, the "SkribeNew.png" logo, and a blue-colored "Skribe 365 Report" title. Journalist entries initially used a generic "target.png" profile icon.
    *   **Styling & Layout Refinements (12:25:58 PM - 1:01:11 PM):**
        *   Comments within the HTML were removed.
        *   Profile images for specific journalists (NDTV India, Live Mint) were updated from a generic "target.png" to a specific hosted image (`https://3iiy5qc9eo.ucarecd.net/...jpg`) between 12:34:15 PM and 12:35:34 PM. Subsequently, all journalist profile images were standardized to a different generic `profile-icon.png` (`https://www.goskribe.com/assets/profile-icon.png`) with a `2px solid #074890` border and `90x90px` dimensions, evident from 12:57:41 PM onwards.
        *   The main title "Skribe 365 Report" underwent significant styling changes to its "365 Report" span, incorporating a `linear-gradient` background with `-webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; background-clip: text; color: transparent;` for a gradient text effect (changes observed between 12:38:06 PM and 12:41:16 PM). The main `<h1>` font size was also increased to `48px` around 12:41:58 PM.
        *   Spacing and alignment adjustments were made to the header elements, notably changing `gap: 12px` to `margin-right: 15px` for the target icon in the header (12:49:29 PM - 12:50:15 PM).
        *   Minor structural adjustments were made to table cell properties (e.g., `min-width: 640px` added to a section header's container at 12:44:02 PM, and re-structuring of the "Business & Economy" header table cells to ensure consistent height and styling around 1:11:22 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Skribe365.html` (12:53:49 PM - 12:54:20 PM):**
    *   **First Version (12:53:49 PM):** This file was distinct from `new365.html`, featuring a dark blue gradient body background, a white main content area with rounded top corners and a box-shadow. Its header also used a dark blue gradient, a different Skribe logo size, and unique styling for section titles and journalist entries. This version included a comprehensive footer with social media links (X, LinkedIn, Instagram) and an unsubscribe button.
    *   **Major Redesign (12:54:20 PM):** This entry shows a complete overhaul of `Skribe365.html`. The page title changed to "Welcome to 365 from Skribe - Newsletter". The body background became white. The header logo changed to "skribe365.png". Section titles were restyled from blue banners to light grey background with black text. All individual journalist profile images were removed. The content of journalist updates was completely refreshed, featuring different names, organizations, roles, and dates (all dated 22/09/2025 or 23/09/2025). The detailed footer from the previous version of this file was omitted.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/3/2025, ~12:34 PM:** Initial image source changes for journalist profiles in `new365.html`.
*   **10/3/2025, ~12:38 PM - 12:41 PM:** Refinements to the main title's gradient text effect and font size in `new365.html`.
*   **10/3/2025, 12:53:49 PM:** Introduction of a completely different email template (`Skribe365.html`) with a dark theme.
*   **10/3/2025, 12:54:20 PM:** `Skribe365.html` undergoes a drastic redesign to a light theme with updated content.
*   **10/3/2025, ~12:57 PM:** Standardization of profile image URLs to a generic "profile-icon.png" across `new365.html`.
*   **10/3/2025, ~1:11 PM - 1:12 PM:** Detailed structural adjustments for section headers in `new365.html` to improve rendering.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HTML Table Layouts:** Both email templates consistently rely on nested HTML `<table>` structures for layout, a common practice for maximum email client compatibility.
*   **Journalist Movement Reporting:** The primary function across all versions and files is to disseminate updates on journalists' new roles and affiliations within various media organizations.
*   **Branding Consistency:** Despite stylistic variations, the "Skribe" brand logo and name remain central to both templates.
*   **Detailed Contact Information:** Each journalist's entry consistently includes their new role, organization, coverage area, email, phone number, and often a Twitter (X) handle.
*   **Iterative Design:** There is a clear pattern of frequent, small adjustments to styling, image sources, and layout, indicating an iterative design process aimed at improving the visual presentation and compatibility of the email templates. This is particularly evident in `new365.html` and the rapid re-design of `Skribe365.html`.
*   **Responsive Considerations:** The inclusion of `meta viewport` tags and a `mobile-responsive-text` class suggests an ongoing effort to ensure the emails display well across different devices.

## 2:19:50 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\new365.html` file, which represents an HTML email template for a "Skribe 365 Report." All modifications occurred on 10/3/2025, with a concentrated period of activity between 1:35:00 PM and 1:57:41 PM.

**File-Specific Updates (`new365.html`):**

*   **Initial State (10/3/2025, 1:35:00 PM):** The template includes a header with "Skribe 365 Report" branding, social media links, and structured content sections. It features `International Affairs` and `Business & Economy` headings, each followed by journalist profile entries. A `Health & Wellness` section is also present. Notably, a redundant "Business & Economy" section header block was commented out.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:35:21 PM and 1:35:32 PM:** No functional changes were introduced during these timestamps; the file content remained identical to the initial state.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:35:56 PM:** The previously commented-out HTML block for a "Business & Economy" section header was uncommented and made active. This resulted in two consecutive "Business & Economy" headers in the document. The newly activated header used HTML entities (`&nbsp;` and `&amp;`) within its `<nobr>` tag for "Business&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Economy," while the existing one maintained "Business & Economy" with standard characters.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:37:15 PM:** No functional changes from the previous timestamp.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:53:47 PM:** The first "Business & Economy" header (the one uncommented at 1:35:56 PM) was commented out again. The remaining "Business & Economy" header was significantly modified: the `<nobr>` tag around its text was removed, `white-space: nowrap;` was added to its `<td>` container, and the parent `<tr>` element received a `min-width: 640px;` style.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:54:24 PM:** The text of the active "Business & Economy" heading was changed from "Business & Economy" to "Business and Economy". Immediately following this, a *new*, second "Business & Economy" header was inserted, identical in structure and text ("Business & Economy") to the one present at 1:53:47 PM. This again created two consecutive Business & Economy headers, one using "and" and the other using "&".
*   **10/3/2025, 1:55:08 PM:** No functional changes from the previous timestamp.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:57:41 PM:** The second "Business & Economy" header (the one with "Business & Economy") that was added at 1:54:24 PM was removed, restoring a single "Business and Economy" header in that section.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/3/2025, 1:35:00 PM:** Initial content established, including a commented-out section.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:35:56 PM:** A previously commented "Business & Economy" header was activated, leading to a duplicate section title.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:53:47 PM:** Reversion of the duplicate header (commented out), and significant styling and tag modifications to the remaining "Business & Economy" header.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:54:24 PM:** Textual change ("&" to "and") and re-introduction of a duplicate "Business & Economy" header.
*   **10/3/2025, 1:57:41 PM:** Final removal of the duplicate "Business & Economy" header.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HTML Structure:** The email template consistently uses nested HTML tables for layout, a common practice in email development for broad client compatibility.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Recurring styles include blue background (`#074890`) for section headers, white text for these headers, and specific font settings (`Inter`, `Source Sans 3`). Profile images consistently feature `border-radius: 50%;` and a `2px solid #074890` border.
*   **Content Pattern:** Journalist profile entries consistently follow a format: profile icon, publication name, role, start date, coverage area, contact email, phone number, and Twitter handle.
*   **Focus on "Business & Economy":** The most frequent and notable changes revolve around the "Business & Economy" section header, including repeated commenting/uncommenting, text variations (`&` vs `and`, `&nbsp;&amp;`), and minor inline style adjustments (`<nobr>`, `white-space: nowrap;`, `min-width`). This indicates active refinement of this specific section's presentation.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The close proximity of timestamps (e.g., changes within seconds or minutes) suggests rapid, iterative adjustments to the HTML structure and content, particularly concerning the "Business & Economy" section.

## 3:19:21 PM
The provided log details a single code change to the `new365.html` file, timestamped at 10/3/2025, 3:13:39 PM.

**File-Specific Updates (`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\new365.html`):**
This file contains the full HTML structure for an email template titled "Skribe 365 Report - Media Industry Updates".
*   **Design & Layout:** The template uses a responsive design with a maximum width of 700px, employing nested tables for layout, which is typical for robust email compatibility. It incorporates custom fonts "Inter" and "Source Sans 3".
*   **Branding & Header:** The header features a background image (`header_365.png`), a Skribe logo (`skribeNew.png`), and a prominent "Skribe 365 Report" title with a blue-to-white gradient text effect. It includes an introductory paragraph about SKRIBE 365 and links to Skribe's Facebook and X (Twitter) profiles.
*   **Content Structure:** The main body organizes content into distinct sections, each marked by a dark blue header (`#074890`) and a horizontal rule. The sections detailed are "International Affairs", "Business and Economy", and an incomplete "Health & Wellness".
*   **Journalist Updates:** Each section lists changes in journalist roles. These entries consistently include:
    *   A generic profile icon (`profile-icon.png`).
    *   The journalist's name and their publication (e.g., NDTV India, Live Mint, Business Today, Fortune India, The Financial Express).
    *   The date of the update (uniformly "24/06/2025").
    *   Their new role and coverage area.
    *   Previous association if applicable.
    *   Contact information: email, phone number, and often an X (Twitter) handle.
    *   Example entries include Mohd Ghazali (NDTV India, Assistant Editor, International Affairs), Sanchari Ghosh (Live Mint, Assistant Editor, International Affairs), Pranaya Prakash (Business Today, News Editor, Business & Economy), and Tamanna Mohanty (Fortune India, Trainee Reporter, Business & Economy).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The log indicates a single modification at 10/3/2025, 3:13:39 PM. This timestamp reflects the last recorded alteration to the `new365.html` file. The dates within the email content (e.g., "24/06/2025") refer to the event dates of the reported journalist moves, not the file's modification date.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in Content:**
*   **Structured Reporting:** The core pattern is the structured reporting of journalist career changes across different media outlets and beats.
*   **Consistent Information:** Each journalist update follows a nearly identical format, providing name, publication, date, new role, coverage area, and contact details (email, phone, X handle).
*   **Standardized Styling:** Section headers (`<h2>`) consistently use a dark blue background with white text and a trailing horizontal divider. Journalist names are highlighted in a distinct blue (`#239DFF`).
*   **Image Assets:** All profile images are sourced from `https://www.goskribe.com/assets/profile-icon.png`, suggesting a placeholder for individual photos or a design choice to use a generic icon. Header images are also hosted on `goskribe.com`.
*   **Future Dating:** The file's modification timestamp (10/3/2025) and the news dates within the report (24/06/2025) are set in the future, implying this might be a template or a preview for an upcoming release.

## 3:45:42 PM
The changes primarily affect two files: `src\config.ts` and `src\pages\SkribeExtra\Email365HTML.tsx`, along with a single update to `.prettierrc`. All modifications occurred on `10/3/2025` between 3:19 PM and 3:44 PM, indicating a focused period of development or adjustment.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\config.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 3:19:18 PM:** The configuration for `baseURL` in the `preview` and `production` environments was updated. Specifically, `baseURL` for `preview` changed to `'https://skribeapi-dev-693920490624.asia-south1.run.app'` and for `production` to `'https://skribeapi-prod-693920490624.asia-south1.run.app'`, replacing previously commented-out `beta.goskribe.com` and `goskribe.com` URLs respectively. The file also exports `getBaseURL`, `getImageURL`, and `isProduction` utility functions.
    *   **Timestamps: 10/3/2025, 3:33:06 PM, 3:33:11 PM, 3:33:43 PM:** Minor, non-functional formatting changes occurred, briefly switching string literals from single quotes to double quotes, and then immediately reverting them back to single quotes. The content remained functionally identical to the 3:19:18 PM version after these minor formatting adjustments.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\SkribeExtra\Email365HTML.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 3:21:58 PM:** The `Email365HTML` React component was initially defined, featuring functions to strip HTML tags and format dates, and a button to copy the generated email HTML to the clipboard. The component structured a basic email template with a Skribe Media logo, a "Welcome to 365 from Skribe" heading, a descriptive paragraph, dynamic content sections based on `primaryBeat` and `selectedList` props, and a footer with social media links and an unsubscribe option.
    *   **Timestamps: 10/3/2025, 3:22:14 PM - 3:23:51 PM:** A series of iterative changes focused on the introductory text. The descriptive paragraph (`SKRIBE 365 is an alert reporting...`) was temporarily commented out (3:22:14 PM), then restored (3:22:29 PM). Its inline CSS styling was refined, first by changing the `style` prop to a string and then correcting it back to a JSX object for better React compatibility (3:22:56 PM, 3:23:27 PM).
    *   **Timestamps: 10/3/2025, 3:25:07 PM - 3:27:41 PM:** A significant visual redesign of the email header was attempted. The "Welcome to 365 from Skribe" heading was commented out (3:25:07 PM, then removed in effect at 3:25:34 PM). A new header element was introduced, including a "target.png" image and a "Skribe 365 Report" title with a CSS gradient text effect. The entire header section was then restructured to be within a `<tr>` element that had a `header_365.png` background image, indicating an attempt to integrate a custom header banner (3:26:41 PM, 3:27:41 PM).
    *   **Timestamps: 10/3/2025, 3:32:15 PM - 3:44:41 PM:** This marks a major reversion. The entire code block reflecting the header redesign and previous styling refinements (from 3:25:07 PM up to 3:27:41 PM) was commented out. Simultaneously, a version of the component that predates these design changes was uncommented and became active. This reverted version restored the original "Welcome to 365 from Skribe" heading and the simpler descriptive paragraph (without the gradient title or background image header). A minor addition to the `completeEmailSource` string for the clipboard functionality included more complete HTML metadata (`lang="en"`, `charset="UTF-8"`, `viewport`, and a specific `<title>`). All subsequent log entries for this file show this reverted state without further changes.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\.prettierrc`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 3:33:36 PM:** A Prettier configuration file was introduced or updated. It enforces semicolons (`"semi": true`), single quotes for strings (`"singleQuote": true`), a print width of 200 characters (`"printWidth": 200`), and a tab width of 4 spaces (`"tabWidth": 4`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration/Reversion:** The `Email365HTML.tsx` file saw a rapid sequence of changes, including a significant visual overhaul to the header, followed by a complete rollback to an earlier version within a short timeframe. This suggests active experimentation or troubleshooting.
*   **Code Commenting:** Extensive use of commenting out large sections of code is prevalent in `Email365HTML.tsx`, both for old code being replaced and for potentially new features that were not kept.
*   **External Assets:** Both `config.ts` and `Email365HTML.tsx` frequently reference external URLs for images (`https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`) and API endpoints (`https://skribeapi-...run.app`), indicating reliance on hosted assets and services.
*   **Formatting Enforcement:** The addition of `.prettierrc` shortly after some minor formatting changes in `config.ts` suggests an effort to standardize code style across the project.
*   **Timestamp Grouping:** All changes are clustered within a single hour on October 3, 2025, pointing to a concentrated development effort.

## 4:19:26 PM
Changes were recorded for a single file, `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\new365.html`, with two significant timestamps: 10/3/2025, 3:25:52 PM and 10/3/2025, 3:46:08 PM. The content appears largely consistent across both entries, suggesting minor saves or edits that aren't fully captured in the provided truncated snippets.

The file itself is an HTML email template for a "Skribe 365 Report - Media Industry Updates".

**File-Specific Updates (`new365.html`):**
*   **Structure and Styling:** The email template is built using HTML tables for layout, targeting a `max-width: 700px` with a light blue background (`#E6EEF2`). It incorporates a custom header with a background image, the "Skribe" logo, and a "Skribe 365 Report" title featuring a CSS gradient text effect. Font-family is set to "Inter" and "Source Sans 3" via Google Fonts. A responsive line-height property (`clamp`) is used for text.
*   **Content Sections:** The report is organized into distinct sections, such as "International Affairs," "Business & Economy," and "Health & Wellness," each marked by a prominent blue header bar (`background-color: #074890`).
*   **Journalist Profiles:** Within each section, there are entries detailing journalist movements and new roles. Each entry typically includes:
    *   A circular `profile-icon.png` image with a blue border.
    *   The media organization (e.g., NDTV India, Live Mint, Business Today, Fortune India, The Financial Express).
    *   A timestamp for the update, consistently "24/06/2025" for all listed journalists.
    *   Journalist's name, new role, areas of coverage, and previous association if applicable.
    *   Contact information including email, phone number, and an X (formerly Twitter) handle.
*   **Introductory Text:** The mailer includes a description of "SKRIBE 365" as an alert reporting journalist moves and changes three times a week, along with calls to action to connect on Facebook and Twitter for broader PR perspectives.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   The initial detailed log entry is from 10/3/2025, 3:25:52 PM.
*   A subsequent log entry for the exact same file is recorded at 10/3/2025, 3:46:08 PM. Given the near identical content provided for both entries, the latter likely represents a minor modification or a simple save operation within a short development window.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
*   **Consistent Journalist Data Structure:** Each journalist entry follows a uniform format, including their publication, new role, coverage area, and contact details, along with the "24/06/2025" date.
*   **Visual Consistency:** The use of `profile-icon.png` for all journalist images and the blue (`#074890`) color scheme for section headers and profile borders creates a unified visual style.
*   **Fixed Update Date:** All journalist updates provided within the mailer consistently reference the date "24/06/2025", indicating a single batch of updates for that specific day.
*   **Social Media Integration:** Links to Facebook and Twitter are prominently featured in the header, encouraging user engagement.

## 4:45:43 PM
The code changes primarily involve the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\SkribeExtra\Email365HTML.tsx`.

**File-Specific Updates (`Email365HTML.tsx`):**

The logs show a significant transition for this file: the entire React functional component `Email365HTML` was converted from a heavily commented-out block (representing an older or inactive version) to active, executable code. This marks the component's enablement or a major update from a previous commented state.

Key updates within the now active code include:

1.  **Enhanced HTML Email Generation**: The `handlePreviewButtonClick` function, responsible for generating a full HTML email source for clipboard copying, was updated.
    *   **Initial Change (around 10/3/2025, 3:48:01 PM)**: The basic `<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title></title></head>...</html>` wrapper for the `emailContainer`'s `outerHTML` was replaced with a more comprehensive HTML structure.
    *   **Further Refinement (finalized around 10/3/2025, 4:28:53 PM)**: The generated HTML now includes standard boilerplate like `<html lang="en">`, `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`, `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`, a `<title>` tag, and crucially, a `<link>` tag to import Google Fonts (`Inter` and `Source Sans 3`), followed by an empty `<style>` block. This indicates an effort to make the copied email content more robust and styled.
2.  **Introduction of `replaceAnd` function**: A new utility function `replaceAnd(text: string)` was added.
    *   Initially (at 10/3/2025, 3:48:01 PM), it was defined to replace `&` with `&amp;`.
    *   Almost immediately (by 10/3/2025, 3:48:27 PM), this was changed to replace `&` with the literal string `'and'`.
    *   This function, while defined, does not appear to be called anywhere within the provided snippets of the component's rendering logic.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/3/2025, 3:48:01 PM**: Initial uncommenting of the component and introduction of the `replaceAnd` function, with a partial new HTML header structure.
*   **10/3/2025, 3:48:27 PM**: Quick correction to the `replaceAnd` function logic, changing `&amp;` to `'and'`.
*   **10/3/2025, 4:28:53 PM**: Finalization of the comprehensive HTML header structure within `completeEmailSource`, including meta tags and Google Fonts link.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The log exhibits a pattern of frequent, identical saves over a short period (from 3:48 PM to 4:29 PM on 10/3/2025). Most entries between 3:48:27 PM and 4:21:45 PM show the same code, suggesting continuous saving during a single development session rather than distinct, incremental code changes. The truly distinct changes occurred at the beginning of this sequence (uncommenting and initial `replaceAnd` definition) and at the very end (completion of the HTML header structure). The overall pattern shows a transition from a commented-out state to a functionally active and enhanced component.

## 5:45:20 PM
The `Email365HTML.tsx` file underwent a significant update or re-activation at `10/3/2025, 4:47:01 PM`. This change involved uncommenting a substantial React functional component named `Email365HTML`, making its email generation logic active.

**File-specific updates for `Email365HTML.tsx`:**

*   **Component Purpose:** The component is designed to render a complete HTML email template for "Skribe 365" content. It dynamically populates the email with "primary beat" categories and associated list items, including `outletname`, `createdDate`, and `description`.
*   **Utility Functions:** It includes `stripHtmlTags` to clean HTML content and `formatDate` to format `Date` objects consistently.
*   **Clipboard Functionality:** A key feature is the `handlePreviewButtonClick` function, which captures the entire generated email's HTML (`emailContainer`) and copies it to the user's clipboard, wrapped in a full `<!DOCTYPE html>` structure. A `useState` hook manages the button's text, indicating "Copy To ClipBoard" or "Source Copied."
*   **Email Structure and Content:**
    *   The email features a header with a Skribe 365 logo (sourced from `https://www.goskribe.com`).
    *   It includes a welcome message and prompts users to connect on social media (Facebook, Twitter).
    *   Content is structured by `primaryBeat`, with each beat displaying filtered `selectedList` items. The `description` field uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, indicating it expects and renders raw HTML.
    *   The footer contains social media icons (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram) linking to Skribe's profiles and a `www.goskribe.com` website link.
    *   An "Unsubscribe" link with a placeholder `<%asm_group_unsubscribe_raw_url%>` is also included.
*   **HTML Head Enhancements:** The updated code introduces a more complete HTML `<head>` section within the copied email source, including `meta` tags for charset and viewport, an empty `title` tag, and a `<link>` tag to import Google Fonts (`Inter` and `Source Sans 3`). The log also shows the *beginning* of an embedded `<style>` block, suggesting further styling definitions are being added or planned, though the content is truncated.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Inline Styling:** The component heavily utilizes inline CSS styles directly within HTML elements, a common practice for email templates to maximize compatibility across various email clients.
*   **Dynamic Content Mapping:** It repeatedly maps over `primaryBeat` and `selectedList` arrays to generate structured content, indicating a data-driven approach to email generation.
*   **Hardcoded Image URLs:** Images like the Skribe 365 logo and social media icons are sourced from `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`, using hardcoded URLs.
*   **Social Media Integration:** Consistent integration of links to Skribe's social media profiles (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram) across the email.

## 6:45:35 PM

The provided log details changes across two key files related to Skribe's email generation and content listing features. The updates primarily focus on enhancing the email's structure and integrating a new data field for images.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\SkribeExtra\Email365HTML.tsx`**

*   **10/3/2025, 6:35:48 PM**: The entire `Email365HTML` React component, previously commented out, was uncommented and made active. This significant change reactivates the functionality for generating an HTML email preview. The HTML structure within the component was also enhanced, adding essential meta tags (`charset`, `viewport`), a `lang="en"` attribute to the `<html>` tag, and a `<link>` for Google Fonts (`Inter`, `Source Sans 3`), suggesting an effort to improve email rendering and styling. An empty `<style>` block was introduced, likely as a placeholder for embedded CSS.
*   **10/3/2025, 6:36:28 PM**: No functional code changes were observed in this entry, indicating a potential save operation without modifications.
*   **10/3/2025, 6:37:40 PM**: The `Email365HTMLProps` interface was updated to include an optional `vchPhotoPath?: string;` property within the `selectedList` item definition. This prepares the component to receive an image path for each content item, though the rendering logic to display it is not part of this specific change.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\SkribeExtra\ListSkribeExtra365.tsx`**

*   **10/3/2025, 6:39:57 PM**: This entry marks the initial introduction of the `ListSkribeExtra365` component, which displays "Skribe 365" content, supports infinite scrolling for pagination, allows users to select items via checkboxes, delete items, and preview selected items as an email using the `Email365HTML` component. It includes state management for records, pagination tokens, loading status, modal visibility, selected items (`selectedIds`), and primary beats (`PrimaryBeat`). The `handleCheckboxChange` function was initially defined to capture `skribe365ContentId`, `description`, `primaryBeat`, `outletname`, and `createdDate` when items are selected.
*   **10/3/2025, 6:40:28 PM**: No functional code changes were observed in this entry.
*   **10/3/2025, 6:42:36 PM**: The `handleCheckboxChange` function's parameters were updated to accept `vchPhotoPath?: string`. However, the internal logic for updating the `selectedIds` state still omitted `vchPhotoPath`, resulting in an incomplete data flow for this new property.
*   **10/3/2025, 6:43:19 PM**: The `handleCheckboxChange` function was further refined. It now correctly includes the `vchPhotoPath` when adding new items to the `selectedIds` state, ensuring the image path is carried through to the `Email365HTML` component.
*   **10/3/2025, 6:43:46 PM**: The `onClick` handler for the checkboxes within the rendered table was updated to pass the `item.vchPhotoPath` argument to the `handleCheckboxChange` function. This finalizes the data flow, ensuring that `vchPhotoPath` is accurately captured from the displayed content when a user selects an item.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature Activation and Enhancement**: There's a clear pattern of activating a previously commented-out component (`Email365HTML.tsx`) and then progressively enhancing its capabilities, notably by improving the generated HTML structure (adding meta tags, font links) and preparing it for new data fields.
*   **Data Model Extension and Integration**: A significant recurring pattern involves extending data structures (e.g., `Email365HTMLProps`, `Record.category`) with new properties like `vchPhotoPath`. This extension then triggers a series of follow-up changes in related components and functions (`handleCheckboxChange`, `selectedIds` state update) to ensure the new data is correctly passed, stored, and made available throughout the application flow. This indicates an iterative development process for new features.
*   **Component Interdependency**: Changes in `Email365HTML.tsx` (interface updates) directly inform and necessitate changes in its consumer, `ListSkribeExtra365.tsx` (passing new props to `Email365HTML` and handling data capture).
*   **Debugging Practices**: The persistent use of `debugger;` statements in functions like `handleDeleteConfirmation`, `deleteBlog`, and `fetchData` in `ListSkribeExtra365.tsx` suggests active development, testing, and debugging during these changes.
*   **API Interaction and UI Management**: Both files demonstrate standard React development patterns, including state management (`useState`), side effects (`useEffect`), performance optimizations (`useCallback`, `useRef` for `IntersectionObserver`), interaction with a `userService` for data, and the use of a `ModalComponent` for displaying content.
