# Activity Summary for 10/3/2025

## 10:31:05 AM
The code changes, all timestamped on 10/3/2025 between 10:04 AM and 10:10 AM, indicate a focused effort on refining reporting functionalities and development environment configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\.prettierrc` (Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 10:04:23 AM)**
    *   This file defines Prettier formatting rules for the project. The configuration specifies: semicolons at the end of statements (`"semi": true`), a tab width of 4 spaces (`"tabWidth": 4`), single quotes for strings (`"singleQuote": true`), and a print width of 200 characters (`"printWidth": 200`). This ensures consistent code style across the project.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx` (Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 10:08:39 AM)**
    *   This file, responsible for generating brand reports, received significant updates, particularly in its PDF generation capabilities.
    *   A new function `downloadPDFWithLinks` was introduced (replacing a commented-out simpler `downloadPDF`), which generates multi-page PDFs using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`. Crucially, this updated function now **captures and adds clickable links** from the HTML content into the generated PDF, enhancing interactivity.
    *   Styling functions (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) were added to temporarily fix display issues for embedded media (images, SVGs, etc.) during PDF generation.
    *   The `calculateDateRange` function was refactored. The previous logic calculated date ranges relative to the current date; the **new logic ensures date ranges correspond to full calendar months**, calculating the end date as the last day of the previous month and start dates relative to that for periods like 1, 3, 6, or 12 months.
    *   The `fetchAllApis` function outlines a comprehensive data fetching strategy for brand reports, making concurrent calls to `/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/AIBrandReport`, and `/BrandMention` endpoints, then populating various state variables with usage, narrative, top publications, journalists, regional mentions, brand mentions, and sentiment scores.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\ClientReportMailer.tsx` (Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 10:10:15 AM)**
    *   This file defines a React component, `EmailTemplate`, used for generating and copying the HTML source of a daily news report email.
    *   It handles the display of articles, grouped by category, with features like formatting publication dates and making article titles clickable links.
    *   A `handlePreviewButtonClick` function allows users to **copy the complete HTML source of the email template to the clipboard**, ready for use in an email client.
    *   The articles are dynamically sorted and grouped by predefined categories, ensuring a structured presentation within the email.
    *   The email template uses extensive inline styling, including a basic media query for mobile responsiveness, which is typical for robust HTML email design.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Report-Centric Development:** A clear pattern emerges around report generation and distribution. Both `BrandReport.tsx` and `ClientReportMailer.tsx` are dedicated to producing different forms of client-facing reports (PDF and email, respectively).
*   **Date and Time Management:** Both reporting files involve specific date handling, with `BrandReport.tsx` focusing on precise date range calculation for full months and `ClientReportMailer.tsx` on date formatting for display.
*   **Backend Integration:** `BrandReport.tsx` demonstrates heavy reliance on a `userService` for fetching data from multiple API endpoints, indicating a structured approach to backend communication for report data.
*   **User Interface Interactivity:** The addition of clickable links in PDFs (`BrandReport.tsx`) and the ability to copy the full HTML email source (`ClientReportMailer.tsx`) highlight a focus on enhancing user interaction and ease of report sharing.

## 10:34:32 AM
The log details changes across three React components within a frontend application, specifically related to brand monitoring and spokesperson articles.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Initial State (10/3/2025, 10:05:08 AM):** This file defines the `ShareofVoice` functional component, serving as a dashboard for brand insights. It initializes state for `mediaType`, `competitor`, and `lastDays` using `useState`. It includes static options for these dropdowns and placeholder data for `brandJournalists` and `competitionJournalists`. The component renders a `BrandHeader`, `MonthShareOfVoice`, `DropdownComponent` for filtering, date input fields, `PieChartSection`, and `TopJournalists`.
    *   **Minor Formatting Change (10/3/2025, 10:07:13 AM):** The code was updated to change all string literals from single quotes (`'`) to double quotes (`"`). There were no functional changes in this update. The entry at 10:05:17 AM shows identical content to the 10:05:08 AM entry, indicating no functional or formatting changes in that specific nine-second interval.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\TopJournalists.jsx`**
    *   **Update (10/3/2025, 10:08:14 AM):** This file introduces the `TopJournalists` functional component, responsible for displaying lists of journalists for both the brand and its competitors. It includes mock data for journalists (e.g., "A Kumar" for brand, "Ravi M." for competition). The component features "Add To CRM" and "Create List" buttons for the competition section. It internally defines and utilizes a `JournalistTable` sub-component to render the data, complete with checkboxes, profile icons, journalist names, outlets, and mention counts.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Spokesperson\Articles.jsx`**
    *   **Update (10/3/2025, 10:09:56 AM):** This file defines the `Articles` functional component, designed to display a paginated list of articles mentioning a spokesperson. It manages state for loading, articles data, total articles, outlet filtering options, and current page. The component fetches data dynamically from a backend API (`SPOKESPERSONARTICLES` and `GET_OUTLET_FILTER_OPTIONS` endpoints) using `userService.post`. It integrates a `MultiSelectDropdown` for outlet filtering and displays selected outlets with a removal option. The articles are rendered using an `ArticleCard` sub-component, showing title, summary, publication date, and sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). Pagination controls are included to navigate through the article list.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/3/2025, 10:05:08 AM**: Establishment of the `ShareofVoice` dashboard component with initial structure and placeholder data.
*   **10/3/2025, 10:07:13 AM**: `ShareofVoice.jsx` undergoes a non-functional formatting change (single to double quotes).
*   **10/3/2025, 10:08:14 AM**: Introduction/update of `TopJournalists.jsx`, setting up the display for brand and competition journalists.
*   **10/3/2025, 10:09:56 AM**: Introduction/update of `Articles.jsx`, implementing dynamic article fetching, filtering, and pagination.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **React Frontend Development:** All changes are within React functional components, indicated by `"use client"` directives and the use of React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
*   **Tailwind CSS for Styling:** The code consistently uses Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g., `w-11/12`, `py-4`, `flex`, `gap-2`, `rounded-lg`, `border`) for layout and styling.
*   **Modular Component Structure:** Components are organized into logical units, with higher-level components (`ShareofVoice`) importing and rendering smaller, specialized components (`MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, `TopJournalists`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`, `ArticleCard`).
*   **State Management:** The `useState` hook is extensively used across components to manage local component state, such as dropdown selections, loading indicators, and data arrays.
*   **Placeholder/Mock Data:** Both `ShareofVoice.jsx` and `TopJournalists.jsx` heavily utilize hardcoded mock data for dropdown options, journalist lists, and article examples, suggesting ongoing development or initial setup before full API integration.
*   **Dropdowns and Filtering:** There's a recurring pattern of using dropdowns (either custom `DropdownComponent` or `MultiSelectDropdown`) to enable filtering and selection of options like media types, number of competitors, date ranges, and article outlets.
*   **API Integration:** The `Articles.jsx` component demonstrates interaction with a backend through a `userService.post` call, using specific API constants for different data fetches.
*   **Pagination:** The `Articles.jsx` component includes client-side pagination logic for managing large datasets.
*   **Code Formatting:** The change in `ShareofVoice.jsx` from single to double quotes for string literals indicates the application of a code formatter or linter across the project.

## 11:19:40 AM
The entire log pertains to a single file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\new365.html`. This file represents an HTML email template for a "Skribe 365 Report" that tracks journalist moves and changes.

**Summary of Changes by Timestamp:**

*   **10/3/2025, 10:33:56 AM:** The initial version of the HTML email template is established. It features a blue gradient background, a central content table with a white background and rounded top corners. The header includes a "Skribe logo," a "Skribe 365 Report" title, and a descriptive paragraph encouraging social media connections (Facebook, Twitter). The main content is divided into sections like "International Affairs," "Business & Economy," and "Health & Wellness," each containing cards detailing journalist updates (name, new role, previous association, contact info, X/Twitter handle) along with a `target.png` image for profiles. A simple footer with social media icons and an unsubscribe link is present.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:40:03 AM:** This entry shows no discernible changes from the previous version, suggesting a minor save or reformat without content alteration.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:42:35 AM (Significant Redesign):** A major overhaul of the template's structure and styling.
    *   The `viewport` meta tag is updated.
    *   The email title changes to "Skribe 365 Report - Journalist Moves and Changes."
    *   A new font, "Source Sans 3," is added, and an internal `<style>` block is introduced for basic body font and a mobile-responsive text utility class.
    *   The main content width is increased from 600px to 700px.
    *   The header section is redesigned with a different linear gradient and rounded bottom corners (`border-radius: 0 0 30px 30px;`).
    *   The Skribe logo image is replaced by a `target.png` icon (80x80px), and the main title gains an emoji ("📊") and larger font size (48px).
    *   The introductory paragraph about the report is moved to be directly under the main title within the header section, and social media links (`x.com` for Twitter) are updated with new styling.
    *   Section headers (e.g., "International Affairs") are restyled with a new blue background and rounded corners.
    *   Journalist profile images are also `target.png` but with new dimensions (70x70px) and `object-fit: cover`.
    *   General text colors and link colors within journalist cards are updated. The footer appears to be truncated in this log entry.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:50:55 AM (Header Refinement and Image Update):** Further stylistic changes are applied.
    *   The email title is updated again to "Skribe 365 Report - Media Industry Updates."
    *   The header is significantly altered to use a background image (`mailerHeader1.png`). The main title font size is reduced to 36px, made uppercase, and letter-spacing is added.
    *   The descriptive paragraph is moved *out* of the header and into a separate `<td>` with a light grey background (`#f8f9fa`).
    *   Section headers are restyled with a darker blue background (`#1E3A5F`) and a different padding/border-radius.
    *   Journalist profile images are changed to `profile.png` (50x50px).
    *   Overall padding and margins are adjusted.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:51:23 AM (Minor Image URL Update):** The background image for the header is updated from `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/mailerHeader1.png` to `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailerimages/header_365.png`.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:54:36 AM (Profile Image Inconsistency):** The profile image sources for "Business Today" and "Fortune India" entries are seemingly reverted back to `target.png`, while others remain `profile.png`.

*   **10/3/2025, 10:55:20 AM:** No observable changes from the previous version, indicating another minor save.

*   **10/3/2025, 11:16:24 AM (Advanced Header & Styling):** Another significant redesign, particularly for the header and section indicators.
    *   New CSS classes (`.header-overlay`, `.curved-bottom`) are introduced for a more complex, visually distinct header.
    *   The header background uses a multi-stop linear gradient and a CSS-based "curved bottom" effect.
    *   A textual "SKRIBE" logo is added to the top-left of the header.
    *   The "Target Icon" is now a purely CSS-styled concentric circle design. The main title is larger (42px) with text shadow.
    *   The main description paragraph is completely separated from the header.
    *   Section headers gain a dynamic blue underline effect using CSS.
    *   Journalist profile images are updated to distinct `profileX.jpg` URLs and are slightly larger (60x60px). Email links within journalist cards lose their `text-decoration` (underline).

*   **10/3/2025, 11:16:35 AM (Partial Reversion/Overwrite):** Many changes from the 11:16:24 AM timestamp are reverted.
    *   The advanced CSS for the header, curved bottom, and CSS-styled target icon are removed.
    *   The header reverts to using the `header_365.png` background image.
    *   Journalist profile images revert to `target.png` for all entries.
    *   The description paragraph is duplicated within the header content `div` *and* in the separate description section.

*   **10/3/2025, 11:18:03 AM:** The duplicated description paragraph from within the header's content overlay `div` is removed, resolving one instance of duplication. However, the description still exists as content within the header's `div` and as a standalone description section.

*   **10/3/2025, 11:18:31 AM:** The duplicated description paragraph from inside the header content `div` is re-introduced, making the content duplication pattern return as seen at 11:16:35 AM.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **File Consistency:** All changes are focused on a single HTML file for an email template, indicating continuous development of this specific asset.
*   **Report Structure:** The core structure of the "Skribe 365 Report" (header, descriptive text, categorized journalist updates, footer) remains consistent across all versions, though its visual implementation evolves.
*   **Journalist Data:** The format and details provided for each journalist update (publication, date, name, role, previous association, contact, social media) are highly consistent.
*   **Image Hosting:** All images are sourced from `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/` or `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`.
*   **Styling Iteration:** There's a clear pattern of iterative design changes, especially around the header and section styling, with multiple significant redesigns followed by minor tweaks or partial reversions. This suggests experimentation or A/B testing of design elements.
*   **Rapid Development:** The timestamps indicate a rapid sequence of modifications within approximately 45 minutes, highlighting active and continuous work on the template.
*   **Content Duplication:** A specific issue related to the introductory paragraph's placement and duplication recurs in the later timestamps, suggesting a challenge in managing that particular content block during layout changes.
