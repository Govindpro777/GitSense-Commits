# Activity Summary for 10/3/2025

## 10:31:05 AM
The code changes, all timestamped on 10/3/2025 between 10:04 AM and 10:10 AM, indicate a focused effort on refining reporting functionalities and development environment configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\.prettierrc` (Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 10:04:23 AM)**
    *   This file defines Prettier formatting rules for the project. The configuration specifies: semicolons at the end of statements (`"semi": true`), a tab width of 4 spaces (`"tabWidth": 4`), single quotes for strings (`"singleQuote": true`), and a print width of 200 characters (`"printWidth": 200`). This ensures consistent code style across the project.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx` (Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 10:08:39 AM)**
    *   This file, responsible for generating brand reports, received significant updates, particularly in its PDF generation capabilities.
    *   A new function `downloadPDFWithLinks` was introduced (replacing a commented-out simpler `downloadPDF`), which generates multi-page PDFs using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`. Crucially, this updated function now **captures and adds clickable links** from the HTML content into the generated PDF, enhancing interactivity.
    *   Styling functions (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) were added to temporarily fix display issues for embedded media (images, SVGs, etc.) during PDF generation.
    *   The `calculateDateRange` function was refactored. The previous logic calculated date ranges relative to the current date; the **new logic ensures date ranges correspond to full calendar months**, calculating the end date as the last day of the previous month and start dates relative to that for periods like 1, 3, 6, or 12 months.
    *   The `fetchAllApis` function outlines a comprehensive data fetching strategy for brand reports, making concurrent calls to `/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/AIBrandReport`, and `/BrandMention` endpoints, then populating various state variables with usage, narrative, top publications, journalists, regional mentions, brand mentions, and sentiment scores.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\ClientReportMailer.tsx` (Timestamp: 10/3/2025, 10:10:15 AM)**
    *   This file defines a React component, `EmailTemplate`, used for generating and copying the HTML source of a daily news report email.
    *   It handles the display of articles, grouped by category, with features like formatting publication dates and making article titles clickable links.
    *   A `handlePreviewButtonClick` function allows users to **copy the complete HTML source of the email template to the clipboard**, ready for use in an email client.
    *   The articles are dynamically sorted and grouped by predefined categories, ensuring a structured presentation within the email.
    *   The email template uses extensive inline styling, including a basic media query for mobile responsiveness, which is typical for robust HTML email design.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Report-Centric Development:** A clear pattern emerges around report generation and distribution. Both `BrandReport.tsx` and `ClientReportMailer.tsx` are dedicated to producing different forms of client-facing reports (PDF and email, respectively).
*   **Date and Time Management:** Both reporting files involve specific date handling, with `BrandReport.tsx` focusing on precise date range calculation for full months and `ClientReportMailer.tsx` on date formatting for display.
*   **Backend Integration:** `BrandReport.tsx` demonstrates heavy reliance on a `userService` for fetching data from multiple API endpoints, indicating a structured approach to backend communication for report data.
*   **User Interface Interactivity:** The addition of clickable links in PDFs (`BrandReport.tsx`) and the ability to copy the full HTML email source (`ClientReportMailer.tsx`) highlight a focus on enhancing user interaction and ease of report sharing.
