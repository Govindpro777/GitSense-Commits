# Activity Summary for 10/6/2025

## 12:14:17 PM
The code changes primarily occurred in two files around 10/6/2025, focusing on a React component for generating email HTML and a configuration file.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\SkribeExtra\Email365HTML.tsx`
**Timestamps:** 10/6/2025, 11:23:14 AM (significant change), followed by identical entries at 11:24:32 AM, 11:24:40 AM, 11:24:46 AM, 11:27:48 AM, and 11:28:12 AM.

**Key Updates:**
*   **Component Activation:** A previously commented-out React functional component `Email365HTML` was made active. This component is responsible for rendering an email newsletter structure.
*   **Dependencies:** Imports for `Link` from `react-router-dom` and `getImageURL` from `../../config` were uncommented and integrated.
*   **Data Interface Enhancement:** The `Email365HTMLProps` interface was updated to include an optional `vchPhotoPath?: string;` property within the `selectedList` items, suggesting a new capability to include images in email content.
*   **Email Template Structure:** The `handlePreviewButtonClick` function, which generates the complete HTML for clipboard copying, was significantly expanded. The generated HTML now includes a full document structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html lang="en">`, and `<head>` tags containing `meta charset`, `viewport`, and a link to Google Fonts (`Inter` and `Source Sans 3`). This ensures better email client compatibility and consistent typography.
*   **Image Sources and Social Media Links:**
    *   The Skribe logo image source was changed from a dynamic `getImageURL()` placeholder (which was commented out) to a hardcoded URL: `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/skribe365.png`.
    *   Social media icons (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram) in the email footer also updated their image sources to hardcoded `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/...` URLs. Specifically, the Instagram icon changed from `Instagram1.png` to `Instagram2.png`.
    *   The `href` attributes for social media links, particularly LinkedIn, were updated, possibly for tracking or revised social media presence.
*   **Unsubscribe Feature:** An unsubscribe mechanism (`data-role="module-unsubscribe"`) was added to the email footer, linking to a placeholder `<%asm_group_unsubscribe_raw_url%>`.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\config.ts`
**Timestamp:** 10/6/2025, 11:28:29 AM

**Key Updates:**
*   **API Base URL Migration:** The `baseURL` for the `preview` and `production` environments were updated.
    *   For `preview`, the `baseURL` was changed from `https://beta.goskribe.com` (commented out) to `https://skribeapi-dev-693920490624.asia-south1.run.app`.
    *   For `production`, the `baseURL` was changed from `https://goskribe.com` (commented out) to `https://skribeapi-prod-693920490624.asia-south1.run.app`.
    *   These changes indicate a migration of backend API services to Google Cloud Run, differentiating between development/preview and production deployments.
*   **Image URLs:** The `imageURL`s for all environments (`development`, `preview`, `production`) remained unchanged, pointing to Google Cloud Storage buckets (`skribe-media-dev` and `skribe-media-prod`).

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
*   All significant changes occurred on the same date, `10/6/2025`, within a concentrated timeframe, suggesting a single development session or deployment cycle.
*   The `Email365HTML.tsx` file had multiple log entries with identical content after the initial change, which might indicate frequent saves without further modifications or the behavior of a specific development tool.
*   There's a trend towards making email templates more robust and standardized (e.g., full HTML document structure, external font imports), and updating resource URLs (images, APIs) to more specific or production-ready endpoints.
*   The use of hardcoded URLs for images within the email template, despite the existence of a `getImageURL` utility in `config.ts`, is a recurring pattern in the `Email365HTML.tsx` file.
