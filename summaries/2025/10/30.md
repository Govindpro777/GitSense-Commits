# Activity Summary for 10/30/2025

## 12:27:13 AM
The development log captures the initial setup and subsequent major enhancements to a backend application, primarily focusing on expense tracking and user authentication.

**Key Information:**

*   **Initial Core Setup (around 10/29/2025, 8:55:06 PM - 9:33:35 PM):**
    *   **`server.js`**: The application's entry point was established, initializing an Express server, connecting to MongoDB, integrating CORS, and setting up an initial `expenseRoutes` and a basic `errorHandler` middleware.
    *   **`config/db.js`**: A `connectDB` function was defined to manage the MongoDB connection using Mongoose, logging success or connection errors.
    *   **`models/Expense.js`**: An `Expense` Mongoose schema was created, detailing fields like `title`, `amount`, `category` (with an enum of predefined values), and `date`, along with timestamps.
    *   **`controllers/expenseController.js`**: Initial API logic for managing expenses was implemented, including functions to retrieve all expenses, add new ones, delete, and update existing expenses. Basic input validation was included.
    *   **`routes/expenseRoutes.js`**: The API endpoints for `/api/expenses` were defined, mapping HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to their respective controller functions.
    *   **`package.json`**: The project's dependencies were set up, including `express`, `mongoose`, `cors`, and `dotenv`.
    *   **`middlewares/errorHandler.js`**: A rudimentary error handling middleware was put in place to catch and respond to application errors.

*   **Major Refactoring and Authentication Integration (around 10/29/2025, 11:45:31 PM - 11:50:47 PM):** This period marks a significant shift, introducing user authentication and tying expenses to specific users.
    *   **`models/User.js`**: A new `User` Mongoose schema was introduced to manage user accounts. It includes `name`, `email` (unique and validated using `validator`), and `password`. Passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs` before saving, and a `matchPassword` method was added for authentication.
    *   **`models/Expense.js`**: The `Expense` schema was updated to include a `user` field, linking each expense to a `User` ObjectId, thereby establishing user ownership for expenses.
    *   **`utils/jwt.js`**: A utility function `generateToken` was created to generate JSON Web Tokens for user authentication, utilizing a `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_EXPIRE` from environment variables.
    *   **`controllers/authController.js`**: A new controller `authController` was developed to handle user registration (`/api/auth/register`), login (`/api/auth/login`), and fetching the currently logged-in user's profile (`/api/auth/me`).
    *   **`middlewares/auth.js`**: A `protect` middleware was implemented to secure routes by verifying JWTs from request headers, extracting the user ID, and attaching the `User` object to the request.
    *   **`routes/authRoutes.js`**: New API routes for user authentication were defined, with the `/me` endpoint protected by the new `auth` middleware.
    *   **`controllers/expenseController.js`**: All expense management functions (`getAllExpenses`, `addExpense`, `deleteExpense`, `updateExpense`) were refactored to be user-specific, ensuring that users can only interact with their own expenses (`user: req.user.id`). The response structure was also standardized to include `success` and `data` fields.
    *   **`routes/expenseRoutes.js`**: All expense routes were updated to be protected by the `auth` middleware (`router.use(protect)`), requiring users to be authenticated to perform any expense operations.
    *   **`server.js`**: The main server file was updated to integrate the new `authRoutes` and to set a `10mb` limit for JSON request bodies.
    *   **`middlewares/errorHandler.js`**: The error handling middleware was significantly enhanced to provide more specific error messages and status codes for common Mongoose errors, such as `CastError` (invalid IDs), duplicate key errors (code 11000), and `ValidationError`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Structure:** The application consistently uses a modular structure with separate files for models, controllers, routes, middleware, and configuration, adhering to Express best practices.
*   **Environment Variables:** Extensive use of `dotenv` and `process.env` for sensitive information (like `MONGO_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`).
*   **Error Handling:** A dedicated `errorHandler` middleware is used throughout the application to centralize error responses. This middleware was progressively enhanced to provide more detailed feedback for specific Mongoose errors.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** All database interactions and API handlers are implemented using `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous code.
*   **Mongoose for Data Management:** Mongoose is the primary ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool, used for defining schemas, interacting with MongoDB, and implementing pre-save hooks (e.g., for password hashing).
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** The log clearly shows an initial setup phase followed by a substantial enhancement phase that added critical features like user authentication and data security, refactoring existing code to align with these new requirements. The timestamping reveals that the security and user management features were developed rapidly in a concentrated burst after the initial CRUD functionality was established.
