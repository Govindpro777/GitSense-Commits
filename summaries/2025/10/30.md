# Activity Summary for 10/30/2025

## 12:27:13 AM
The development log captures the initial setup and subsequent major enhancements to a backend application, primarily focusing on expense tracking and user authentication.

**Key Information:**

*   **Initial Core Setup (around 10/29/2025, 8:55:06 PM - 9:33:35 PM):**
    *   **`server.js`**: The application's entry point was established, initializing an Express server, connecting to MongoDB, integrating CORS, and setting up an initial `expenseRoutes` and a basic `errorHandler` middleware.
    *   **`config/db.js`**: A `connectDB` function was defined to manage the MongoDB connection using Mongoose, logging success or connection errors.
    *   **`models/Expense.js`**: An `Expense` Mongoose schema was created, detailing fields like `title`, `amount`, `category` (with an enum of predefined values), and `date`, along with timestamps.
    *   **`controllers/expenseController.js`**: Initial API logic for managing expenses was implemented, including functions to retrieve all expenses, add new ones, delete, and update existing expenses. Basic input validation was included.
    *   **`routes/expenseRoutes.js`**: The API endpoints for `/api/expenses` were defined, mapping HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to their respective controller functions.
    *   **`package.json`**: The project's dependencies were set up, including `express`, `mongoose`, `cors`, and `dotenv`.
    *   **`middlewares/errorHandler.js`**: A rudimentary error handling middleware was put in place to catch and respond to application errors.

*   **Major Refactoring and Authentication Integration (around 10/29/2025, 11:45:31 PM - 11:50:47 PM):** This period marks a significant shift, introducing user authentication and tying expenses to specific users.
    *   **`models/User.js`**: A new `User` Mongoose schema was introduced to manage user accounts. It includes `name`, `email` (unique and validated using `validator`), and `password`. Passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs` before saving, and a `matchPassword` method was added for authentication.
    *   **`models/Expense.js`**: The `Expense` schema was updated to include a `user` field, linking each expense to a `User` ObjectId, thereby establishing user ownership for expenses.
    *   **`utils/jwt.js`**: A utility function `generateToken` was created to generate JSON Web Tokens for user authentication, utilizing a `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_EXPIRE` from environment variables.
    *   **`controllers/authController.js`**: A new controller `authController` was developed to handle user registration (`/api/auth/register`), login (`/api/auth/login`), and fetching the currently logged-in user's profile (`/api/auth/me`).
    *   **`middlewares/auth.js`**: A `protect` middleware was implemented to secure routes by verifying JWTs from request headers, extracting the user ID, and attaching the `User` object to the request.
    *   **`routes/authRoutes.js`**: New API routes for user authentication were defined, with the `/me` endpoint protected by the new `auth` middleware.
    *   **`controllers/expenseController.js`**: All expense management functions (`getAllExpenses`, `addExpense`, `deleteExpense`, `updateExpense`) were refactored to be user-specific, ensuring that users can only interact with their own expenses (`user: req.user.id`). The response structure was also standardized to include `success` and `data` fields.
    *   **`routes/expenseRoutes.js`**: All expense routes were updated to be protected by the `auth` middleware (`router.use(protect)`), requiring users to be authenticated to perform any expense operations.
    *   **`server.js`**: The main server file was updated to integrate the new `authRoutes` and to set a `10mb` limit for JSON request bodies.
    *   **`middlewares/errorHandler.js`**: The error handling middleware was significantly enhanced to provide more specific error messages and status codes for common Mongoose errors, such as `CastError` (invalid IDs), duplicate key errors (code 11000), and `ValidationError`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Structure:** The application consistently uses a modular structure with separate files for models, controllers, routes, middleware, and configuration, adhering to Express best practices.
*   **Environment Variables:** Extensive use of `dotenv` and `process.env` for sensitive information (like `MONGO_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`).
*   **Error Handling:** A dedicated `errorHandler` middleware is used throughout the application to centralize error responses. This middleware was progressively enhanced to provide more detailed feedback for specific Mongoose errors.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** All database interactions and API handlers are implemented using `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous code.
*   **Mongoose for Data Management:** Mongoose is the primary ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool, used for defining schemas, interacting with MongoDB, and implementing pre-save hooks (e.g., for password hashing).
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** The log clearly shows an initial setup phase followed by a substantial enhancement phase that added critical features like user authentication and data security, refactoring existing code to align with these new requirements. The timestamping reveals that the security and user management features were developed rapidly in a concentrated burst after the initial CRUD functionality was established.

## 1:27:03 AM
The project's backend development, spanning approximately three hours, focused initially on establishing a foundational expense tracking API, and subsequently, on integrating robust user authentication and authorization features.

**File-Specific Updates and Timestamps:**

*   **`server.js` (10/29/2025, 8:55:06 PM & 11:50:28 PM):** Initially configured the Express server with `cors`, JSON body parsing, MongoDB connection, and basic `expenseRoutes`. A later update incorporated `authRoutes`, adjusted the JSON body parser limit to "10mb", and removed commented-out initial code, reflecting a shift to a more complete, authenticated application.
*   **`config\db.js` (10/29/2025, 8:55:50 PM):** Established the MongoDB connection using Mongoose, including error handling for connection failures. This file remained stable after its initial creation.
*   **`models\Expense.js` (10/29/2025, 8:56:24 PM & 11:45:52 PM):** Initially defined the expense schema with fields like `title`, `amount`, `category`, and `date`. A significant update later introduced a `user` field (`mongoose.Schema.ObjectId` referencing 'User'), making expenses user-specific and required.
*   **`controllers\expenseController.js` (10/29/2025, 8:57:18 PM & 11:49:29 PM):** First implemented basic CRUD operations (`getAllExpenses`, `addExpense`, `deleteExpense`, `updateExpense`) for expenses. The later update drastically refactored these functions to enforce user-specific actions, fetching, adding, deleting, and updating expenses based on the authenticated user's ID (`req.user.id`). Error responses were standardized with `success` flags and updated messages.
*   **`routes\expenseRoutes.js` (10/29/2025, 8:59:22 PM & 11:49:46 PM):** Initially defined routes for `/api/expenses` for CRUD operations. The later update introduced the `protect` middleware to secure all expense-related routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access them, and removed the initial commented-out code.
*   **`package.json` (10/29/2025, 9:31:29 PM):** Set up project metadata, start scripts, and initial dependencies (`express`, `mongoose`, `cors`, `dotenv`). No further explicit changes were logged, but the introduction of authentication implies additions like `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `validator`.
*   **`middlewares\errorHandler.js` (10/29/2025, 9:33:35 PM & 11:50:47 PM):** Started as a basic error handler logging the stack and returning a generic error message. It was significantly enhanced later to provide more specific error handling for Mongoose-related issues, including `CastError` (404), duplicate key errors (400), and `ValidationError` (400) with detailed messages, improving API robustness.
*   **`models\User.js` (10/29/2025, 11:45:31 PM):** A new schema was introduced for `User`s, including `name`, `email` (unique, validated, lowercase), and `password` (hashed using `bcryptjs` before saving, `select: false`). It also includes a method to compare passwords.
*   **`utils\jwt.js` (10/29/2025, 11:47:38 PM):** A new utility function `generateToken` was created to generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for user authentication, using `jsonwebtoken` and environmental variables for secret and expiry.
*   **`controllers\authController.js` (10/29/2025, 11:48:07 PM):** A new controller was implemented to handle user authentication: `register` (for creating new users and issuing JWTs), `login` (for authenticating existing users and issuing JWTs), and `getMe` (for retrieving the current user's details).
*   **`middlewares\auth.js` (10/29/2025, 11:48:36 PM):** A new `protect` middleware was added. Its role is to verify JWTs from incoming requests, extract the user ID, fetch the user from the database, and attach the user object to the request, thereby protecting routes that require authentication.
*   **`routes\authRoutes.js` (10/29/2025, 11:49:03 PM):** New routes were defined for user authentication: `/api/auth/register` (POST), `/api/auth/login` (POST), and `/api/auth/me` (GET, protected).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Incremental Development:** The log clearly shows a two-phase development approach: first, core functionality (expense management), then, layering on authentication and authorization.
*   **Modular Structure:** Consistent use of separate files for models, controllers, routes, and middleware demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, improving maintainability.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Widespread use of `async/await` for database interactions and other I/O-bound tasks.
*   **Error Handling:** A consistent pattern of passing errors to a centralized `errorHandler` middleware using `next(error)`. The `errorHandler` itself evolved to be more specific and user-friendly.
*   **API Response Consistency:** A shift towards standardized API responses including `success` status, messages, and `data` objects across both authentication and expense management endpoints.
*   **Security Focus:** The later changes extensively incorporated security features: password hashing (`bcryptjs`), token-based authentication (`jsonwebtoken`), and route protection middleware, alongside user-specific data access.
*   **Environment Variables:** Reliance on `.env` files for configuration, such as database URL, port, and JWT secrets, promoting flexibility and security.

## 10:12:19 AM
The provided log details several changes within a Backend project, focusing on configuration and the main server setup.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`.gitignore` (multiple updates between 10/30/2025, 1:52:34 AM and 1:55:12 AM):**
    *   Initially, the `.gitignore` file includes common exclusions such as `logs`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `dist-ssr`, and editor-specific directories (`.vscode/`, `.idea`). It also explicitly ignored `.env`.
    *   At 1:54:01 AM, the `.env` file was temporarily removed from the ignore list.
    *   Shortly after, at 1:55:12 AM, `.env` was added back to the ignore list, indicating a clarification or correction in what should be excluded from version control.
*   **`server.js` (10/30/2025, 9:53:58 AM):**
    *   This file represents the core of the backend server. It's built with Express.js.
    *   It imports and utilizes `cors`, `dotenv`, `cookie-parser`, a custom database connection utility (`./config/db`), authentication routes (`./routes/authRoutes`), expense-related routes (`./routes/expenseRoutes`), and a global error handling middleware (`./middlewares/errorHandler`).
    *   The server is configured to connect to MongoDB.
    *   A robust CORS setup is implemented, allowing origins from `CLIENT_URL` specified in environment variables or a set of default origins including `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:8081`, and `https://expense-frontend-nine-taupe.vercel.app`. It handles credentials and explicitly defines allowed HTTP methods and headers, including explicit handling for preflight `OPTIONS` requests.
    *   The server parses JSON request bodies (with a limit of "10mb") and cookies.
    *   API endpoints are defined for authentication (`/api/auth`) and expenses (`/api/expenses`).
    *   It listens on a `PORT` defined in environment variables or defaults to 5000.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/30/2025, 1:52:34 AM - 1:55:12 AM:** A brief period of rapid adjustments to the `.gitignore` file, primarily concerning the inclusion/exclusion of the `.env` file. This suggests initial project setup and refinement of version control rules.
*   **10/30/2025, 9:53:58 AM:** Marks the introduction or a significant update of the main `server.js` file, establishing the core backend logic, routes, and middleware for the application.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Environment Variable Usage:** The project heavily relies on environment variables, indicated by the use of `dotenv.config()` in `server.js` and the handling of the `.env` file in `.gitignore`. This includes `MONGO_URL`, `PORT`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRE`, and `CLIENT_URL`.
*   **Standard Backend Setup:** The `server.js` file demonstrates a typical Node.js/Express.js backend structure, including middleware for CORS, cookie parsing, JSON body parsing, route definitions, database connection, and centralized error handling.
*   **Security and Configuration Focus:** There's an emphasis on secure configuration with the meticulous CORS setup, handling of sensitive `.env` files, and the inclusion of authentication routes.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The `server.js` implies a modular structure with separate files for database configuration, authentication routes, expense routes, and error handling middleware.

## 2:54:43 PM
**File:** `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx`

**Summary of Changes:**

*   **10/30/2025, 2:50:09 PM:** This initial version of the `BrandReport.tsx` file established the foundational structure for generating brand reports.
    *   It incorporates `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` for creating PDF reports from HTML content, notably including a `downloadPDFWithLinks` function to ensure clickable links are preserved in the generated PDF. Custom CSS (`pdf-style-fix`) is dynamically applied to improve rendering of media elements within the PDF.
    *   The `GenerateReport` component manages a comprehensive state, encompassing customer and brand selections, date ranges, loading indicators, and various report data points (e.g., usage, performance, narratives, publications, journalists).
    *   A `calculateDateRange` function is defined to determine report periods in full UTC calendar months, ensuring consistency across date calculations.
    *   The `fetchAllApis` function was set up to concurrently fetch `MonthlyReportDetails` and `AIBrandReport` data. However, at this point, the API call for `BrandMention` data and its subsequent state updates (for `brandMention` and `sentimentScore`) were commented out.

*   **10/30/2025, 2:51:30 PM:** A quick follow-up change was implemented to fully enable the fetching of brand mention and sentiment data.
    *   The `fetchAllApis` function was modified to include the `userService.get(/BrandMention...)` API call within the `Promise.all` array.
    *   Correspondingly, the `setBrandMention(brandMentionRes.data.mentionStats);` and `setSentimentScore(brandMentionRes.data.sentimentStats);` lines were uncommented. This ensures that the report now actively retrieves and displays brand mention statistics and sentiment scores.
    *   No other significant changes were observed; the rest of the file, including PDF generation logic, date range calculation, and state management, remained consistent with the previous version.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

*   **PDF Generation Focus:** Both entries highlight a strong emphasis on robust PDF generation, specifically the ability to convert multi-section HTML content into a PDF while maintaining interactive links and proper styling.
*   **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** The `fetchAllApis` function consistently uses `Promise.all` for efficient concurrent fetching of multiple API endpoints related to report data.
*   **Modular Component Design:** The imports suggest that the Brand Report relies on several sub-components (e.g., `UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `CompetitorSummary`, `Narratives`), indicating a modular and organized approach to report structure.
*   **State-Driven UI:** The `GenerateReport` component heavily leverages React's `useState` hook for managing various aspects of the report's data and UI state.
*   **Date Range Standardization:** The `calculateDateRange` function demonstrates a pattern of ensuring date calculations adhere to full calendar month logic and UTC for reliability.

## 3:55:05 PM
The log primarily details changes within three TypeScript files related to brand reporting: `BrandReport.tsx`, `BrandSummary.tsx`, and `CompetitorNarratives.tsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (10/30/2025, 2:50:09 PM):** The `fetchAllApis` function was fetching `MonthlyReportDetails` and `BrandMention`. The `AIBrandReport` API call was commented out, and related state updates (`setBrandMention`, `setSentimentScore`) were also commented. The `calculateDateRange` function was defined to compute date ranges based on periods (1, 3, 6, 12 months), ending on the last day of the previous month using UTC.
    *   **Significant Update (10/30/2025, 2:51:30 PM):** The `AIBrandReport` API call was uncommented and integrated into the `Promise.all` alongside `MonthlyReportDetails` and `BrandMention`. Corresponding state updates for `setBrandMention` and `setSentimentScore` were also uncommented, indicating a full activation of data fetching for the brand report.
    *   **Temporary Disabling/Re-enabling (10/30/2025, 3:01:35 PM, 3:03:18 PM, 3:36:43 PM, 3:37:41 PM, 3:47:40 PM, 3:49:13 PM):** Large sections of code, including the `fetchAllApis` function and even the entire `GenerateReport` component, were repeatedly commented out and then uncommented. This suggests frequent testing, debugging, or temporary feature toggling during development.
    *   **Date Calculation Bug & Fix (10/30/2025, 3:06:40 PM, 3:07:50 PM):** The `calculateDateRange` function had a temporary modification where the calculation for "Last 3 months" and "Last 6 months" periods was incorrectly extended by one month (e.g., `getUTCMonth() - 2` changed to `-3` for 3 months). This was quickly reverted in the subsequent change, restoring the correct logic for calculating N full calendar months.
    *   **Hardcoded Sample Data Introduction (10/30/2025, 3:49:35 PM):** A substantial `parsedData` constant was added, containing a `sqlQuery` and detailed sample `explanation` including `narratives` (headlines, summaries, sentiments, outlets, authors, links, timelines) and `competitors` for "BookMyShow." This indicates the introduction of mock data, likely for development or testing purposes without live API calls.
    *   The core PDF generation logic (`downloadPDFWithLinks`, `applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) remained consistently present and active throughout all changes, allowing conversion of HTML sections to PDF with clickable links.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\BrandSummary.tsx`**
    *   **Full Comment-Out (10/30/2025, 3:02:42 PM):** The entire component, including its state, chart configurations, and data transformation functions for publications, journalists, sentiment, regional mentions, and brand mentions, was commented out. This suggests it was temporarily disabled or undergoing major reconstruction.
    *   **No Further Changes (10/30/2025, 3:02:49 PM):** The file remained fully commented out in the subsequent log entry.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\CompetitorNarratives.tsx`**
    *   **Full Comment-Out (10/30/2025, 3:48:37 PM):** The entire component, which included a line chart for narrative timelines and detailed narrative displays, was commented out. Similar to `BrandSummary.tsx`, this indicates temporary disabling or significant changes.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/30/2025, 2:51:30 PM:** Full data fetching from `AIBrandReport` and `BrandMention` APIs was enabled.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:02:42 PM:** The `BrandSummary` component was entirely commented out.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:06:40 PM - 3:07:50 PM:** A brief, incorrect modification to date range calculation in `BrandReport.tsx` was introduced and then immediately reverted.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:36:43 PM - 3:49:13 PM:** Repeated cycles of commenting out and uncommenting large parts of `BrandReport.tsx` occurred.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:48:37 PM:** The `CompetitorNarratives` component was entirely commented out.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:49:35 PM:** Hardcoded sample data for brand narratives and competitors was introduced into `BrandReport.tsx`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration/Debugging:** The repeated commenting and uncommenting of large code blocks in `BrandReport.tsx` within short timeframes (often minutes) is a strong pattern, suggesting active development, debugging, or testing of functionalities.
*   **Modular Reporting Components:** The structure implies a report generated from multiple sub-components (`UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `CompetitorSummary`, `CompetitorNarratives`, `Narratives`), which are dynamically populated with data.
*   **PDF Generation Focus:** The persistent and robust PDF generation functionality (`jspdf`, `html2canvas`) indicates that PDF output with clickable links is a critical feature of the brand report.
*   **API-Driven Data Fetching:** The `fetchAllApis` function consistently attempts to gather data from multiple backend endpoints, highlighting a data-intensive nature of the report.
*   **Date Range Specificity:** The `calculateDateRange` function's detailed UTC-based logic for monthly periods suggests precision in reporting timeframes.
*   **Temporary Component Disabling:** The full commenting out of `BrandSummary.tsx` and `CompetitorNarratives.tsx` might indicate a temporary pause in their development or integration, possibly while the core data fetching and PDF generation in `BrandReport.tsx` were being stabilized or tested with mock data.

## 4:55:14 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the `BrandReport.tsx` file and related components responsible for generating comprehensive brand reports, likely in PDF format.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx`**
    *   **10/30/2025, 2:50:09 PM - 2:51:30 PM**: The API call to `userService.get(/BrandMention)` and the subsequent state updates for `brandMention` and `sentimentScore` were initially commented out, then quickly reinstated. This suggests a brief period of testing or debugging related to brand mention and sentiment data fetching.
    *   **10/30/2025, 3:01:35 PM - 3:03:18 PM**: The entire `fetchAllApis` function, responsible for gathering all report data, was temporarily commented out and then restored, indicating a short-term disablement of API fetching.
    *   **10/30/2025, 3:06:40 PM**: The `calculateDateRange` function was updated. Specifically, the logic for calculating the `startDate` for "Last 3 months" and "Last 6 months" was adjusted to subtract `3` and `6` from `endDate.getUTCMonth()` respectively, ensuring calculation based on full calendar months leading up to the end of the previous month (represented by `endDate`).
    *   **10/30/2025, 3:36:43 PM - 3:37:41 PM**: A significant portion of the file, including the PDF generation functions, state declarations, and date range logic, was commented out and then largely uncommented. Concurrently, the `CompetitorSummary` import was removed. This points to a major refactoring or temporary disabling of core report generation functionality. This pattern of commenting/uncommenting recurs at **3:47:40 PM** and **3:49:13 PM**.
    *   **10/30/2025, 3:49:35 PM**: A large, hardcoded `parsedData` object was introduced. This object contains sample `sqlQuery`, detailed `explanation` (including multiple `narratives` with headlines, summaries, sentiments, mentioned outlets, authors, article links, and timelines), and a list of `competitors`. The `narrativeData` state was initialized using this `parsedData`. This strongly suggests a move to use mock data for development or demonstration.
    *   **10/30/2025, 4:14:28 PM**: The `parsedData` constant was moved outside the `GenerateReport` component, making it a module-level constant. State variables (`usageAndPerformance`, `brandSummaryData`, etc.) within `GenerateReport` were then set to static values or parts of this `parsedData` object, further cementing the use of mock data over live API calls.
    *   **10/30/2025, 4:17:59 PM**: The `parsedDataType` export was refined to `typeof parsedData.explanation.narratives`, and the `narrativeData` state was specifically initialized with `parsedData.explanation.narratives`.
    *   **10/30/2025, 4:27:07 PM - 4:41:19 PM**: The `narrativeData` state initialization was temporarily changed to `parsedData.explanation` and then reverted to `parsedData.explanation.narratives`, indicating some experimentation or debugging around the exact structure of narrative data expected by downstream components.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\BrandSummary.tsx`**
    *   **10/30/2025, 3:02:42 PM - 3:02:49 PM**: The entire file was commented out, effectively disabling the Brand Summary section.
    *   **10/30/2025, 4:42:09 PM**: The file was uncommented, reactivating the Brand Summary component. This component is responsible for displaying top publications, top journalists, sentiment scores, regional mentions, and brand mentions using ApexCharts and ReactSpeedometer. It includes various data transformation and calculation functions.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\CompetitorNarratives.tsx`**
    *   **10/30/2025, 3:48:37 PM**: The entire content of this file was commented out. This component, previously responsible for displaying competitor narratives, is effectively disabled.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\Narratives.tsx`**
    *   **10/30/2025, 4:15:57 PM**: The type definition for `data.narratives` in `PaginatedNarrativesProps` was broadened to `any`, reducing type safety.
    *   **10/30/2025, 4:23:17 PM**: The `parsedDataType` was imported from `../Reports/BrandReport`, and the `data.narratives` type in `PaginatedNarrativesProps` was updated to this specific imported type.
    *   **10/30/2025, 4:24:41 PM**: The `data.narratives` type was further refined to `parsedDataType[]`, indicating that an array of narratives of that specific type is expected.
    *   **10/30/2025, 4:39:20 PM**: A `console.log` statement was added to the `FirstPage` component, likely for debugging purposes related to narrative data.

**Key Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/30/2025, 3:06:40 PM**: Refinement of date range calculation logic in `BrandReport.tsx`.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:36:43 PM - 3:49:13 PM**: Repeated large-scale commenting out and uncommenting of code in `BrandReport.tsx`, including the removal of `CompetitorSummary` import.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:49:35 PM**: Introduction of hardcoded `parsedData` in `BrandReport.tsx`, marking a shift to mock data.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:14:28 PM**: Moving `parsedData` to a module-level constant and initializing state variables with it in `BrandReport.tsx`.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:17:59 PM**: Fine-tuning of `parsedDataType` and `narrativeData` state initialization in `BrandReport.tsx`.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:23:17 PM - 4:24:41 PM**: Progressive refinement of narrative data types in `Narratives.tsx` for better type safety.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:42:09 PM**: Full re-activation of the `BrandSummary.tsx` component.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **PDF Generation Focus:** Both `BrandReport.tsx` and the commented-out code segments demonstrate a consistent effort to generate PDF reports using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`, including applying specific styles and embedding clickable links.
*   **Data Fetching and State Management:** The `GenerateReport` component in `BrandReport.tsx` extensively uses `useState` for various report parameters and data types, and `Promise.all` for concurrent API calls (when active).
*   **Toggle/Comment Out for Development:** A prominent pattern is the frequent commenting out and uncommenting of large code blocks (entire components like `BrandSummary`, `CompetitorNarratives`, or functions like `fetchAllApis`), indicating agile development, debugging, or feature toggling.

The provided log details code changes across two files: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx` and `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\*`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx`**

This file, responsible for generating brand reports, undergoes frequent and significant modifications, primarily centered around data fetching, date calculation, and PDF generation.

*   **10/30/2025, 2:50:09 PM:** An initial change includes a refactor of the `calculateDateRange` function to use `Date.UTC` for more accurate month calculations, commenting out the previous date logic. The `fetchAllApis` function temporarily comments out fetching `AIBrandReport`, `BrandMention` data, and related state updates (`setBrandMention`, `setSentimentScore`). A `downloadPDF` function is also commented out in favor of `downloadPDFWithLinks`.
*   **10/30/2025, 2:51:30 PM:** The previously commented-out API calls and state updates within `fetchAllApis` are re-enabled, restoring data fetching for AI brand reports, brand mentions, and sentiment scores.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:01:35 PM & 3:03:18 PM:** The entire `fetchAllApis` function is commented out and then quickly uncommented, suggesting a temporary disabling for testing or debugging.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:06:40 PM & 3:07:50 PM:** The `calculateDateRange` function sees specific updates to correctly calculate start dates for "Last 3 months" and "Last 6 months" (changing `-2` to `-3` and `-5` to `-6` months respectively), followed by an immediate reversion of these changes.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:36:43 PM - 3:36:49 PM & 3:47:40 PM:** The entire content of `BrandReport.tsx` is repeatedly commented out and then restored (at **3:37:41 PM** and **3:49:13 PM**), indicating intense periods of refactoring, isolation, or feature toggling.
*   **10/30/2025, 3:49:13 PM:** A large, hardcoded `parsedData` object is introduced, containing SQL query details and extensive narrative examples (e.g., about "BookMyShow" facilitating events, handling regional cinema, new film releases, and a competitor "Ticket9"). This object also lists `competitors` like "pvr cinemas", "zomato district", and "ticketnew".
*   **10/30/2025, 3:49:35 PM:** The `narrativeData` state is initialized with `parsedData.explanation.narratives`, indicating a shift to using this hardcoded data instead of live API results for narratives.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:14:28 PM & 4:17:59 PM:** A type export `parsedDataType` is added, initially representing the entire `parsedData` object and then refined to specifically `parsedData.explanation.narratives`, improving type safety for narrative data.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:27:07 PM:** The `narrativeData` state initialization is changed to `parsedData.explanation`, making the state variable hold the entire `explanation` object (including `narratives` and `competitors`).
*   **10/30/2025, 4:55:00 PM:** A new state variable `competitorData` is introduced, and an import for `cA` from `@fullcalendar/core/internal-common` is added.
*   **10/30/2025, 5:08:21 PM:** Another state variable `competitiveNarratives` is added, and `co` is added to the `@fullcalendar/core/internal-common` import.
*   **10/30/2025, 5:09:44 PM:** An interface `ICompetitiveNarrative` is defined, and the `competitiveNarratives` state is strongly typed as `ICompetitiveNarrative[]`.

**2. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\BrandSummary.tsx`**

*   **10/30/2025, 3:02:42 PM & 3:02:49 PM:** The entire `BrandSummary` component, including its charting logic, data transformation, and rendering, is commented out.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:42:09 PM:** The `BrandSummary` component is uncommented, restoring its full functionality for displaying top publications, journalists, sentiment scores, regional mentions, and brand mentions using ApexCharts and ReactSpeedometer.

**3. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\CompetitorNarratives.tsx`**

*   **10/30/2025, 3:48:37 PM:** The entire `CompetitorNarratives` component is commented out. The main header `<h1>` text is specifically changed from "Narrative" to "Competitive Narrative" within this commented block.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:55:38 PM:** The `CompetitorNarratives` component is uncommented, making it active again with the "Competitive Narrative" header.

**4. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\Narratives.tsx`**

*   **10/30/2025, 4:15:57 PM:** The `narratives` prop within `PaginatedNarrativesProps` is loosely typed as `any`.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:23:17 PM:** Imports `parsedDataType` from `BrandReport.tsx` and attempts to use it for the `narratives` prop, indicating a move towards shared type definitions.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:24:41 PM:** Refines the `narratives` prop type to `parsedDataType[]`, aligning with the expectation of an array of narrative objects.
*   **10/30/2025, 4:39:20 PM:** Adds a `console.log` statement for debugging in the `FirstPage` component and reverts the `narratives` prop type back to a generic `NarrativeData[]`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Frequent Code Commenting/Uncommenting:** A dominant pattern is the repeated commenting out and uncommenting of large sections of code, including entire components (`BrandReport.tsx`, `BrandSummary.tsx`, `CompetitorNarratives.tsx`) and critical functions (`fetchAllApis`). This strongly suggests active development, intensive debugging cycles, or feature toggling for different development phases (e.g., testing UI with mock data versus live API).
*   **Date Calculation Refinements:** The `calculateDateRange` function consistently undergoes modifications related to handling time periods (months), indicating an iterative process to ensure accurate date range generation, specifically for full calendar months using UTC.
*   **PDF Generation Focus:** Functions related to PDF creation (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`, `downloadPDFWithLinks`) are present in `BrandReport.tsx` throughout the logs, indicating that PDF report generation is a core feature under continuous development, especially adding clickable links.
*   **Mock Data Integration:** The introduction and utilization of the `parsedData` object in `BrandReport.tsx` for `narrativeData` highlights a strategy to decouple frontend development from live API responses, allowing UI components to be built and tested independently.
*   **Evolution of Type Definitions:** There's an observable effort to introduce and refine TypeScript interfaces and types (`parsedDataType`, `ICompetitiveNarrative`), improving code maintainability and ensuring data consistency across components.
*   **Expansion of Competitive Analysis:** The addition of `competitorData` and `competitiveNarratives` states and interfaces in `BrandReport.tsx`, alongside the un-commenting and specific naming in `CompetitorNarratives.tsx`, signifies an ongoing development effort to enhance the report with competitor-focused insights.
*   **Console Logging for Debugging:** The addition of `console.log` statements (e.g., in `Narratives.tsx`) is a common debugging practice observed in the changes.
