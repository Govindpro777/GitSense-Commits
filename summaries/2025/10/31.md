# Activity Summary for 10/31/2025

## 10:12:15 AM
This log details changes to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx` on `10/31/2025, 9:13:24 AM`.

The primary focus of this file is the generation of a comprehensive brand report, particularly its PDF export functionality and data management.

Key updates include:

*   **PDF Generation Enhancements**: The `downloadPDFWithLinks` function is central to this. It leverages `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` to convert multiple HTML sections (`.pdf-section`) into a single PDF document. A significant addition is the ability to preserve and embed clickable links from the original HTML into the generated PDF, ensuring interactive elements are maintained. Custom CSS styles (`applyStyle`/`removeStyle`) are temporarily injected to ensure proper rendering of media elements (images, SVGs, etc.) during canvas capture.
*   **Data Structures and Interfaces**: Several interfaces (`Customer`, `ISendReportClients`, `ISendReportStatus`, `ICompetitiveNarrative`) are defined to structure data related to customer information, client report details, report status, and competitive narratives.
*   **Mock Report Data (`parsedData`)**: A large `parsedData` constant is included, serving as extensive mock data for brand narratives and competitive analysis. This data, specifically for "BookMyShow," showcases detailed narrative structures including headlines, summaries, sentiment, mentioned outlets, authors, article links, and daily timelines. It also lists competitors like "pvr cinemas" and "zomato district." This likely facilitates development and testing without requiring a live backend connection.
*   **`GenerateReport` Component Structure**: The `GenerateReport` functional component initializes a wide array of state variables using `useState`. These variables are designed to manage user inputs (selected customer, brand, date range, period), loading states, and various data points required for the report, such as usage and performance, brand summary, top publications/journalists, sentiment scores, narrative data, regional mentions, and competitive data.
*   **Dynamic Date Range Calculation**: A `calculateDateRange` function is implemented to dynamically determine start and end dates for reporting periods (last 1, 3, or 6 full calendar months), consistently using UTC dates relative to the end of the previous month.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
*   The code heavily relies on `useState` for managing the numerous data points and UI states necessary for a complex report generator.
*   There's a clear pattern of preparing data for different sections of a report (summary, usage, performance, narratives, competitors).
*   The use of `SweetAlert2` (`MySwal`) indicates a pattern for user feedback and interactive prompts.
*   The extensive mock data suggests a pattern of developing UI and logic independently of a fully integrated backend initially, or for demo purposes.

This preserves interactivity. It also includes dynamic CSS styling (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) to ensure correct rendering of media elements (images, SVGs) within the PDF output.
*   **Comprehensive Report State Management:** The component utilizes numerous `useState` hooks to manage various aspects of report generation, including customer and brand selection, date ranges, loading states, and data for different report sections such as usage and performance, brand summary, top publications/journalists, sentiment scores, narratives, regional mentions, and competitive analysis.
*   **Dynamic Date Calculation:** A `calculateDateRange` function is implemented to determine report periods (1, 3, or 6 full calendar months) based on the last day of the previous month, ensuring consistent and accurate date selections using UTC.
*   **Mock Data Integration:** The file contains a substantial `parsedData` object, which appears to be mock data for development or testing. This object includes a sample SQL query and detailed "BookMyShow" narratives. Each narrative entry provides a headline, summary, sentiment, mentioned outlets, authors, specific article links (formatted as markdown links), and a timeline of mentions. This mock data demonstrates the expected structure and content for the various report sections.
*   **Structured Data Types:** Several TypeScript interfaces (`Customer`, `ISendReportClients`, `ISendReportStatus`, `ICompetitiveNarrative`) are defined to enforce type safety and clarity for the different data models used throughout the report generation process.
*   **Modular Component Design:** The component imports and integrates several sub-components from `../BrandMonthlyReport/` (e.g., `UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `CompetitorNarratives`, `Narratives`), suggesting a modular approach to building the report interface.
*   **External Dependencies:** It leverages external libraries like `jspdf` and `html2canvas` for PDF functionality and `sweetalert2` for interactive alerts.

The file's content indicates a focus on delivering a robust, interactive, and data-rich brand reporting solution with a strong emphasis on PDF output fidelity and user-selected data ranges.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx`, last updated on `10/31/2025, 9:13:24 AM`, is primarily responsible for generating detailed brand reports.

**Key Information:**

*   **PDF Generation with Interactivity:** The most prominent feature is the `downloadPDFWithLinks` function, which leverages `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` to convert HTML sections into a PDF. Crucially, it extracts and embeds clickable links from the original HTML into the generated PDF, allowing for interactive reports. Temporary CSS is applied during PDF generation to ensure proper rendering of elements like images and SVGs.
*   **Report Data Structures:** Several TypeScript interfaces (`Customer`, `ISendReportClients`, `ISendReportStatus`, `ICompetitiveNarrative`) are defined to structure client information, report sending details, and competitive narrative data.
*   **Report Component State Management:** The `GenerateReport` functional component utilizes numerous `useState` hooks to manage a wide array of report parameters and fetched data. These include selected customer and brand, date ranges, loading states, monthly report details, usage and performance metrics, brand summary, top publications/journalists, sentiment scores, narrative data, regional mentions, competitive data, and report sending statuses.
*   **Sample/Default Report Data:** A `parsedData` constant is present, containing a sample `sqlQuery` and extensive `explanation` data. This `explanation` includes a list of `narratives`, each detailing a `headline`, `summary`, `sentiment`, `mentioned_outlets`, `authors`, `article_links`, and a `timeline` of mentions. This indicates a structured approach to presenting report content, possibly as a fallback or a template for AI-generated summaries. It also lists sample `competitors`.
*   **Dynamic Date Range Calculation:** A `calculateDateRange` function is implemented to determine report start and end dates based on selected periods (1, 3, or 6 full calendar months). The end date is consistently set to the last day of the previous month (UTC), providing standardized reporting periods.
*   **Dependencies:** The component imports several sub-components like `UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `CompetitorNarratives`, and `Narratives`, suggesting a modular approach to building the report UI. It also uses `sweetalert2` for user alerts and `userService` for backend interactions.
