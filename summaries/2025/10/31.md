# Activity Summary for 10/31/2025

This log details changes to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx` on `10/31/2025, 9:13:24 AM`.

The primary focus of this file is the generation of a comprehensive brand report, particularly its PDF export functionality and data management.

Key updates include:

*   **PDF Generation Enhancements**: The `downloadPDFWithLinks` function is central to this. It leverages `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` to convert multiple HTML sections (`.pdf-section`) into a single PDF document. A significant addition is the ability to preserve and embed clickable links from the original HTML into the generated PDF, ensuring interactive elements are maintained. Custom CSS styles (`applyStyle`/`removeStyle`) are temporarily injected to ensure proper rendering of media elements (images, SVGs, etc.) during canvas capture.
*   **Data Structures and Interfaces**: Several interfaces (`Customer`, `ISendReportClients`, `ISendReportStatus`, `ICompetitiveNarrative`) are defined to structure data related to customer information, client report details, report status, and competitive narratives.
*   **Mock Report Data (`parsedData`)**: A large `parsedData` constant is included, serving as extensive mock data for brand narratives and competitive analysis. This data, specifically for "BookMyShow," showcases detailed narrative structures including headlines, summaries, sentiment, mentioned outlets, authors, article links, and daily timelines. It also lists competitors like "pvr cinemas" and "zomato district." This likely facilitates development and testing without requiring a live backend connection.
*   **`GenerateReport` Component Structure**: The `GenerateReport` functional component initializes a wide array of state variables using `useState`. These variables are designed to manage user inputs (selected customer, brand, date range, period), loading states, and various data points required for the report, such as usage and performance, brand summary, top publications/journalists, sentiment scores, narrative data, regional mentions, and competitive data.
*   **Dynamic Date Range Calculation**: A `calculateDateRange` function is implemented to dynamically determine start and end dates for reporting periods (last 1, 3, or 6 full calendar months), consistently using UTC dates relative to the end of the previous month.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
*   The code heavily relies on `useState` for managing the numerous data points and UI states necessary for a complex report generator.
*   There's a clear pattern of preparing data for different sections of a report (summary, usage, performance, narratives, competitors).
*   The use of `SweetAlert2` (`MySwal`) indicates a pattern for user feedback and interactive prompts.
*   The extensive mock data suggests a pattern of developing UI and logic independently of a fully integrated backend initially, or for demo purposes.
