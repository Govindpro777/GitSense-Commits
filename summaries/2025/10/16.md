# Activity Summary for 10/16/2025

## 11:30:33 AM
The `Sentiment.jsx` file, updated on **10/16/2025, 10:39:24 AM**, is a React component responsible for displaying a comprehensive brand sentiment dashboard.

**Key Updates and Functionality:**

*   **Core Sentiment Dashboard:** This component serves as the main interface for sentiment analysis within the brand section of the frontend application.
*   **Data Fetching:** It integrates with `userService` to retrieve two main sets of data:
    *   Overall brand sentiment scores (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`), which include aggregate sentiment, positive, negative, and neutral scores, along with their percentage changes over a selected period.
    *   Detailed sentiment split data (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`) based on selected filters.
*   **Dynamic Time Period Selection:** Users can select predefined time ranges for sentiment analysis, such as "Last 1 month," "Last 3 months," "Last 6 months," "Last 1 week," "Last 24 hours," or define a "Custom Date Range." The component dynamically calculates and updates `startDate` and `endDate` based on these selections, with specific handling for "Custom Date Range" to enable date input fields.
*   **Filtering Capabilities:** The dashboard offers robust filtering options:
    *   **Media Type:** A `MultiSelectDropdown` allows users to filter sentiment data by various media types.
    *   **Competitors:** Another `MultiSelectDropdown` enables filtering by selected competitors, whose data is fetched dynamically.
*   **Date Validation:** It includes logic to prevent an `endDate` from being set earlier than the `startDate` in custom date ranges, providing user feedback via a notification.
*   **Performance Metrics Display:** The component presents key performance metrics for sentiment (overall score, positive, negative, neutral) in a card-like layout, showing the score percentage and a percentage change indicator (green for positive change, red for negative). `react-loading-skeleton` is used for visual feedback during data loading.
*   **Sentiment Split Visualization:** A `SentimentBarChart` is rendered to visualize the detailed sentiment split data.
*   **Narrative Selection:** Buttons are provided to toggle between "Company Narratives" and "Competitor Narratives," indicating the presence of a `NarrativeSection` component for displaying related textual content (though its full implementation is truncated in the log).
*   **Dependencies and Utilities:** The component heavily utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), custom hooks (`useLocalStorage`, `useBrandMediaTypes`, `useNotification`), and external UI components (`BrandHeader`, `SentimentBarChart`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`). A `formatDate` utility function is present to convert `YYYY-MM-DD` to `MM-DD-YYYY`, likely for API compatibility.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` to manage various UI states (loading, selected filters, date ranges) and fetched data.
*   **Side Effects:** `useEffect` hooks are crucial for triggering data fetches based on changes in selected filters or time periods.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Loading states are handled gracefully using `Skeleton` components.
*   **Reusable UI Components:** Consistent usage of custom `DropdownComponent` and `MultiSelectDropdown` for user input and filtering across different sections.
*   **API Interaction:** Standardized approach for making API calls using `userService.get` and `userService.post`, with `try...catch` blocks for error handling.

## 12:30:54 PM
**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`**

*   **10/16/2025, 12:12:57 PM:** This initial version sets up the `SentimentMain` React component, designed for a brand sentiment dashboard. It includes imports for various UI components, custom hooks (`useBrandMediaTypes`, `useNotification`, `useLocalStorage`), and API constants (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`). The component manages state for loading status, media types, time periods, selected competitors, and sentiment data. It features functionality for handling date range changes, calculating start/end dates, fetching sentiment scores and split data, and rendering performance metrics (Sentiment Score, Positive, Negative, Neutral) with skeleton loading. It provides dropdowns for media type and time period selection, date input fields, and a multi-select dropdown for competitors, along with a `SentimentBarChart` and narrative period selection buttons.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:19:45 PM:** The import for `GET_COMETITOR_BRAND_LIST` was added from the `constants` file, indicating an upcoming feature to fetch and display competitor data.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:20:28 PM:** A new constant array `periodOptionsNarrative` was introduced, initially duplicating the `periodOptions` structure.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:21:38 PM:** The `periodOptionsNarrative` array was modified to include distinct time periods for narratives, specifically "Last 24 hours", "Last 1 week", "Last 1 month", "Last 3 months", and "Last 6 months", and removed the `period` property from its objects.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:22:00 PM:** The `periodOptionsNarrative` array was further refined, correcting an apparent duplicate entry for "Last 1 week" and setting "Last 24 hours" as the first option.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:22:39 PM:** The `periodOptionsNarrative` array was renamed to `time`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:23:32 PM:** The `time` array was again renamed to `timeStamp`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:26:18 PM:** A new state variable `selectedTimestamp` was added and initialized to "Last 1 month," likely to manage the selection from the newly defined `timeStamp` options for narratives.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:26:53 PM:** A new handler function `handleTimestampChange` was added to update the `selectedTimestamp` state.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:29:33 PM:** A typo in the imported constant was corrected, changing `GET_COMETITOR_BRAND_LIST` to `GET_COMPETITOR_BRAND_LIST`.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**

*   **Consistent Updates (10/16/2025, 12:17:40 PM - 12:29:15 PM):** This file consistently defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints using `export const`. These endpoints are all prefixed with `Url_V1` (derived from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_URL_V1`) and cover a wide array of application features. These include authentication (login, signup, OTP, password reset, token management), user preferences (geo, media types, beats, competitors, topics, brands, spokespersons), reporting, campaign management (list creation, tracking, email sending, attachments), CRM functions, dashboard analytics, social media integrations (Instagram, Twitter), geographical statistics, and brand tracking (add/deactivate brands, keywords, competitors, spokespersons). Multiple log entries for this file show identical content, suggesting frequent saves during development without functional changes between those specific timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** There's a clear pattern of iterative development for `Sentiment.jsx`, particularly in the creation, refinement, and renaming of a new set of time-period options (`periodOptionsNarrative` -> `time` -> `timeStamp`) and the introduction of corresponding state management (`selectedTimestamp`, `handleTimestampChange`). This indicates active work on enhancing time-based filtering for narratives.
*   **Centralized API Management:** The `constants.js` file consistently serves as a single source of truth for all API endpoints, demonstrating a structured approach to managing backend communication. Most endpoints follow a `/v1/` prefix, likely indicating an API version.
*   **Focus on Brand Dashboard Functionality:** Both sets of changes contribute to the "Brand Dashboard" functionality, with `Sentiment.jsx` handling the frontend display and interaction for sentiment analysis, and `constants.js` providing the necessary backend integration points for data retrieval.
*   **Minor Typo Correction:** The correction of `GET_COMETITOR_BRAND_LIST` to `GET_COMPETITOR_BRAND_LIST` highlights attention to detail and code quality during development.

## 1:30:47 PM
The code changes primarily focus on two files: `Sentiment.jsx` and `constants.js`, indicating significant development around the Brand Sentiment feature and its API integrations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`**
This file, a React component, underwent a series of iterative refinements and bug fixes related to data fetching and state management for brand sentiment and narrative data.

*   **10/16/2025, 12:32:46 PM**: The component was initially set up to fetch `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE` and `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`. It included basic date range selection logic and displayed sentiment scores (Positive, Negative, Neutral) with loading skeletons. An `useEffect` attempted to call `GET_COMPETITOR_BRAND_LIST` with an empty `timeStamp` parameter.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:34:43 PM**: A new state `competitorsOfNarrative` was introduced, with an incomplete assignment attempt within a data fetch `useEffect`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:36:59 PM**: The import `GET_COMPETITOR_BRAND_LIST` was replaced with `GET_BRAND_NARRATIVE`. The corresponding `useEffect` was updated to fetch `GET_BRAND_NARRATIVE` (though still with an empty `timeStamp` parameter) and populate `competitorsOfNarrative`. A `brandNarrative` state was declared but not fully initialized.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:40:18 PM**: The `brandNarrative` state was correctly initialized (`useState([])`). The `useEffect` for `GET_BRAND_NARRATIVE` was modified to clear both `brandNarrative` and `competitorsOfNarrative` before fetching and to set `brandNarrative` data. A bug was introduced where this `useEffect`'s dependency array became empty, causing it to run only once.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:41:17 PM**: A crucial fix was applied to the `GET_BRAND_NARRATIVE` API call, which now correctly includes `selectedTimestamp` in the URL, encoded using `encodeURIComponent`. The `useEffect`'s dependency array was also corrected to `[selectedTimestamp]`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:45:41 PM**: The `getBrandNarrative` function temporarily and incorrectly changed from using `userService.get` to `userService.post`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:48:54 PM**: The API call for `GET_BRAND_NARRATIVE` reverted to `userService.get`, and the `timeStamp` parameter encoding was removed.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:49:56 PM**: Logic to fetch competitor narratives (`competitorNarrativeData` function) was introduced within the same `useEffect` as `getBrandNarrative`, but it incorrectly called `GET_BRAND_NARRATIVE` for competitor data and redundantly set `brandNarrative` and `competitorsOfNarrative`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:54:21 PM**: The `competitorNarrativeData` function was updated to correctly use `COMPETITOR_NARRATIVE` for its API call and to set a new state variable, `competitorsNarrativeData`. The `competitorsParam` in the URL remained empty.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:54:52 PM**: An attempt was made to pass `competitorsOfNarrative` to the `COMPETITOR_NARRATIVE` API call via `competitorsParam`.
*   **10/16/2025, 1:07:28 PM**: The entire `Sentiment.jsx` component was commented out, effectively disabling it.
*   **10/16/2025, 1:11:52 PM**: The component was uncommented. A new state variable `selectedCompetitorsNarrative` was added, intended for competitor narrative filtering.
*   **10/16/2025, 1:15:42 PM**: The `getBrandNarrative` function was enhanced to correctly map `res?.competitors` to an array of `brandName` strings, which is then used to set `competitorsOfNarrative`.
*   **10/16/2025, 1:17:52 PM**: The `COMPETITOR_NARRATIVE` API call was updated to use `selectedCompetitorsNarrative` for its `competitorsParam`.
*   **10/16/2025, 1:18:29 PM**: The `useEffect` handling narrative data was updated to include `selectedCompetitorsNarrative` in its dependency array, ensuring re-fetching when the selected competitors for narrative change.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**
This file, which defines various API endpoint constants for the application, saw only minor, non-functional changes in the provided logs. The content remained largely stable, consisting of concatenated base URLs from environment variables and specific endpoint paths. The core structure and a vast array of API endpoints (e.g., authentication, CRM, reports, brand, influencer, spokesperson, topic, campaign, media list APIs) were consistently maintained across the recorded timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **React State Management**: Extensive use of `useState` for managing UI and data states (e.g., loading, selected filters, fetched data).
*   **React Side Effects**: Frequent utilization of `useEffect` for data fetching operations, often dependent on user selections (like `period` or `selectedTimestamp`).
*   **Date Handling Logic**: A dedicated `handleDateRangeChange` function and helper `formatDate` function are consistently used to process and format date ranges for API requests.
*   **API Interaction**: The `userService` is consistently used for making API `get` and `post` requests.
*   **Loading Indicators**: The component leverages `react-loading-skeleton` to provide a smooth user experience during data loading, especially for performance metrics.
*   **API Endpoint Structure**: The `constants.js` file demonstrates a clear pattern of defining API endpoints by concatenating a base URL (derived from environment variables) with specific path segments, organizing them by feature area (e.g., Reports, Campaign, Brand Dashboard).
*   **Error Logging**: Every `try...catch` block around API calls consistently logs errors to the console.
*   **Dropdown and Multi-Select Filters**: The UI components `DropdownComponent` and `MultiSelectDropdown` are used to allow users to filter data by media type, time period, and competitors.

## 2:30:50 PM
`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Narrative.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/16/2025, 1:34:49 PM)

This file underwent a significant transformation. It transitioned from a commented-out, possibly older version that used hardcoded narrative data, to an active, dynamic component. Key updates include:

*   **Dynamic Data Handling:** It now accepts `brandNarrativeData`, `competitorsNarrativeData`, `loading`, and `narrativesPeriod` as props, indicating a shift to fetching data dynamically for both the primary brand and its competitors.
*   **Loading State:** Integration of `react-loading-skeleton` for improved user experience during data fetching.
*   **Enhanced Sentiment Visualization:** Introduction of `getSentimentColor` and `getSentimentBorderColor` functions to apply background and border colors (e.g., `bg-green-100 text-green-800` for positive) based on sentiment, replacing simpler text-based coloring.
*   **Refactored Rendering:** A new `renderNarrativeCard` function encapsulates the display logic for individual narratives, accommodating an optional `brandName` for competitor entries.
*   **Data Structure Adaptation:** The component now accesses narrative dates from `narrative.timeline` and counts outlets via `narrative.mentionedOutlets?.length`, suggesting changes in the backend data structure.
*   **Conditional Display:** Narratives are now rendered conditionally based on `narrativesPeriod` (e.g., "Company Narratives").

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx` (Timestamps: 10/16/2025, 1:35:03 PM and 10/16/2025, 1:50:15 PM)

At both timestamps, the entire content of this file, which previously contained the `SentimentMain` component, was commented out. This indicates a complete deactivation or temporary removal of the sentiment analysis page's main logic. The commented-out code showed:

*   **Extensive State Management:** Handling of various states for loading, media types, time periods, selected competitors, sentiment scores, and narrative data.
*   **API Interactions:** Usage of `userService` to call APIs like `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_NARRATIVE`, and `COMPETITOR_NARRATIVE`.
*   **Date Filtering Logic:** Comprehensive functions for managing date ranges, including predefined periods and custom date selections, and formatting dates for API requests.
This comprehensive commenting out suggests either a major rewrite in progress or a temporary shelving of the feature.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Catalog\Articles.jsx` (Timestamps: 10/16/2025, 1:36:25 PM, 1:36:40 PM, 1:37:06 PM, 1:37:44 PM, 1:37:51 PM, 1:38:11 PM)

This file introduces and iteratively refines an `Articles` component for displaying a brand's article catalog.

*   **Initial Setup (1:36:25 PM):** The component is introduced with state management for articles, loading, pagination, selected outlets, sentiment, and date ranges. It defines `dateRangeOptions` and `sentimentTypeOptions`. It includes functions for fetching articles (`getArticlesData`), handling pagination, and managing date filters. There was an initial inconsistency where `pageSize` and `pageNumber` were in the API query string but not fully in the POST request payload.
*   **Payload Refinements (1:36:40 PM, 1:37:06 PM):** `endDate` and `pageNumber` were progressively added to the `getArticlesData` POST request payload, aiming for more consistent API parameter passing.
*   **`pageSize` Correction (1:37:44 PM, 1:37:51 PM):** A `pageSize: ""` entry was briefly added to the payload, which was quickly corrected to `pageSize: "20"` in a subsequent commit, addressing a potential bug.
*   **API Call Streamlining (1:38:11 PM):** The most significant change was the refactoring of the `getArticlesData` API call. All filtering and pagination parameters (`startDate`, `endDate`, `pageNumber`, `pageSize`, `outlet`, `sentiment`) were moved exclusively into the POST request body, removing redundancy with query parameters and standardizing the API interaction.
*   **Filtering and Pagination:** The component provides robust filtering by outlet, date range, and sentiment, along with pagination controls for displaying articles.
*   **Article Card:** Includes an `ArticleCard` sub-component to render individual article details, including sentiment, website, title, summary, and publish date.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Date Handling:** All affected components (active `Articles.jsx` and the previously active `Sentiment.jsx`) utilize similar date range selection logic and helper functions (`handleDateRangeChange`, `startDate`, `endDate`) to filter data, suggesting a shared utility or design pattern for time-based filtering across the application.
*   **API Service Usage:** `userService.get` and `userService.post` are consistently used for all data fetching, often with checks for `res?.response?.status === "Ok"`.
*   **Loading Indicators:** Both `Narrative.jsx` (with `Skeleton`) and `Articles.jsx` (with `isLoading` state and "Loading Articles..." message) manage loading states to provide feedback to the user.
*   **Sentiment Display:** The application frequently categorizes and displays sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) with distinct visual styling (colors, borders), indicating its importance as a key metric.
*   **Component Refactoring & Evolution:** The changes highlight an active development phase, with `Narrative.jsx` undergoing a major overhaul and `Sentiment.jsx` being temporarily deactivated, while `Articles.jsx` saw iterative improvements in its data fetching mechanism.
*   **API Parameter Strategy:** The evolution of `Articles.jsx` demonstrates a refinement in how API parameters are passed, moving towards centralizing them within the POST request payload for clarity and consistency.
