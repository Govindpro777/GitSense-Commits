# Activity Summary for 10/16/2025

## 11:30:33 AM
The `Sentiment.jsx` file, updated on **10/16/2025, 10:39:24 AM**, is a React component responsible for displaying a comprehensive brand sentiment dashboard.

**Key Updates and Functionality:**

*   **Core Sentiment Dashboard:** This component serves as the main interface for sentiment analysis within the brand section of the frontend application.
*   **Data Fetching:** It integrates with `userService` to retrieve two main sets of data:
    *   Overall brand sentiment scores (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`), which include aggregate sentiment, positive, negative, and neutral scores, along with their percentage changes over a selected period.
    *   Detailed sentiment split data (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`) based on selected filters.
*   **Dynamic Time Period Selection:** Users can select predefined time ranges for sentiment analysis, such as "Last 1 month," "Last 3 months," "Last 6 months," "Last 1 week," "Last 24 hours," or define a "Custom Date Range." The component dynamically calculates and updates `startDate` and `endDate` based on these selections, with specific handling for "Custom Date Range" to enable date input fields.
*   **Filtering Capabilities:** The dashboard offers robust filtering options:
    *   **Media Type:** A `MultiSelectDropdown` allows users to filter sentiment data by various media types.
    *   **Competitors:** Another `MultiSelectDropdown` enables filtering by selected competitors, whose data is fetched dynamically.
*   **Date Validation:** It includes logic to prevent an `endDate` from being set earlier than the `startDate` in custom date ranges, providing user feedback via a notification.
*   **Performance Metrics Display:** The component presents key performance metrics for sentiment (overall score, positive, negative, neutral) in a card-like layout, showing the score percentage and a percentage change indicator (green for positive change, red for negative). `react-loading-skeleton` is used for visual feedback during data loading.
*   **Sentiment Split Visualization:** A `SentimentBarChart` is rendered to visualize the detailed sentiment split data.
*   **Narrative Selection:** Buttons are provided to toggle between "Company Narratives" and "Competitor Narratives," indicating the presence of a `NarrativeSection` component for displaying related textual content (though its full implementation is truncated in the log).
*   **Dependencies and Utilities:** The component heavily utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), custom hooks (`useLocalStorage`, `useBrandMediaTypes`, `useNotification`), and external UI components (`BrandHeader`, `SentimentBarChart`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`). A `formatDate` utility function is present to convert `YYYY-MM-DD` to `MM-DD-YYYY`, likely for API compatibility.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` to manage various UI states (loading, selected filters, date ranges) and fetched data.
*   **Side Effects:** `useEffect` hooks are crucial for triggering data fetches based on changes in selected filters or time periods.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Loading states are handled gracefully using `Skeleton` components.
*   **Reusable UI Components:** Consistent usage of custom `DropdownComponent` and `MultiSelectDropdown` for user input and filtering across different sections.
*   **API Interaction:** Standardized approach for making API calls using `userService.get` and `userService.post`, with `try...catch` blocks for error handling.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`**

*   **10/16/2025, 12:12:57 PM:** This initial version sets up the `SentimentMain` React component, designed for a brand sentiment dashboard. It includes imports for various UI components, custom hooks (`useBrandMediaTypes`, `useNotification`, `useLocalStorage`), and API constants (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`). The component manages state for loading status, media types, time periods, selected competitors, and sentiment data. It features functionality for handling date range changes, calculating start/end dates, fetching sentiment scores and split data, and rendering performance metrics (Sentiment Score, Positive, Negative, Neutral) with skeleton loading. It provides dropdowns for media type and time period selection, date input fields, and a multi-select dropdown for competitors, along with a `SentimentBarChart` and narrative period selection buttons.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:19:45 PM:** The import for `GET_COMETITOR_BRAND_LIST` was added from the `constants` file, indicating an upcoming feature to fetch and display competitor data.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:20:28 PM:** A new constant array `periodOptionsNarrative` was introduced, initially duplicating the `periodOptions` structure.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:21:38 PM:** The `periodOptionsNarrative` array was modified to include distinct time periods for narratives, specifically "Last 24 hours", "Last 1 week", "Last 1 month", "Last 3 months", and "Last 6 months", and removed the `period` property from its objects.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:22:00 PM:** The `periodOptionsNarrative` array was further refined, correcting an apparent duplicate entry for "Last 1 week" and setting "Last 24 hours" as the first option.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:22:39 PM:** The `periodOptionsNarrative` array was renamed to `time`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:23:32 PM:** The `time` array was again renamed to `timeStamp`.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:26:18 PM:** A new state variable `selectedTimestamp` was added and initialized to "Last 1 month," likely to manage the selection from the newly defined `timeStamp` options for narratives.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:26:53 PM:** A new handler function `handleTimestampChange` was added to update the `selectedTimestamp` state.
*   **10/16/2025, 12:29:33 PM:** A typo in the imported constant was corrected, changing `GET_COMETITOR_BRAND_LIST` to `GET_COMPETITOR_BRAND_LIST`.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**

*   **Consistent Updates (10/16/2025, 12:17:40 PM - 12:29:15 PM):** This file consistently defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints using `export const`. These endpoints are all prefixed with `Url_V1` (derived from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_URL_V1`) and cover a wide array of application features. These include authentication (login, signup, OTP, password reset, token management), user preferences (geo, media types, beats, competitors, topics, brands, spokespersons), reporting, campaign management (list creation, tracking, email sending, attachments), CRM functions, dashboard analytics, social media integrations (Instagram, Twitter), geographical statistics, and brand tracking (add/deactivate brands, keywords, competitors, spokespersons). Multiple log entries for this file show identical content, suggesting frequent saves during development without functional changes between those specific timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** There's a clear pattern of iterative development for `Sentiment.jsx`, particularly in the creation, refinement, and renaming of a new set of time-period options (`periodOptionsNarrative` -> `time` -> `timeStamp`) and the introduction of corresponding state management (`selectedTimestamp`, `handleTimestampChange`). This indicates active work on enhancing time-based filtering for narratives.
*   **Centralized API Management:** The `constants.js` file consistently serves as a single source of truth for all API endpoints, demonstrating a structured approach to managing backend communication. Most endpoints follow a `/v1/` prefix, likely indicating an API version.
*   **Focus on Brand Dashboard Functionality:** Both sets of changes contribute to the "Brand Dashboard" functionality, with `Sentiment.jsx` handling the frontend display and interaction for sentiment analysis, and `constants.js` providing the necessary backend integration points for data retrieval.
*   **Minor Typo Correction:** The correction of `GET_COMETITOR_BRAND_LIST` to `GET_COMPETITOR_BRAND_LIST` highlights attention to detail and code quality during development.
