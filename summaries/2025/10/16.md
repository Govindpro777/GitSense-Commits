The `Sentiment.jsx` file, updated on **10/16/2025, 10:39:24 AM**, is a React component responsible for displaying a comprehensive brand sentiment dashboard.

**Key Updates and Functionality:**

*   **Core Sentiment Dashboard:** This component serves as the main interface for sentiment analysis within the brand section of the frontend application.
*   **Data Fetching:** It integrates with `userService` to retrieve two main sets of data:
    *   Overall brand sentiment scores (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`), which include aggregate sentiment, positive, negative, and neutral scores, along with their percentage changes over a selected period.
    *   Detailed sentiment split data (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`) based on selected filters.
*   **Dynamic Time Period Selection:** Users can select predefined time ranges for sentiment analysis, such as "Last 1 month," "Last 3 months," "Last 6 months," "Last 1 week," "Last 24 hours," or define a "Custom Date Range." The component dynamically calculates and updates `startDate` and `endDate` based on these selections, with specific handling for "Custom Date Range" to enable date input fields.
*   **Filtering Capabilities:** The dashboard offers robust filtering options:
    *   **Media Type:** A `MultiSelectDropdown` allows users to filter sentiment data by various media types.
    *   **Competitors:** Another `MultiSelectDropdown` enables filtering by selected competitors, whose data is fetched dynamically.
*   **Date Validation:** It includes logic to prevent an `endDate` from being set earlier than the `startDate` in custom date ranges, providing user feedback via a notification.
*   **Performance Metrics Display:** The component presents key performance metrics for sentiment (overall score, positive, negative, neutral) in a card-like layout, showing the score percentage and a percentage change indicator (green for positive change, red for negative). `react-loading-skeleton` is used for visual feedback during data loading.
*   **Sentiment Split Visualization:** A `SentimentBarChart` is rendered to visualize the detailed sentiment split data.
*   **Narrative Selection:** Buttons are provided to toggle between "Company Narratives" and "Competitor Narratives," indicating the presence of a `NarrativeSection` component for displaying related textual content (though its full implementation is truncated in the log).
*   **Dependencies and Utilities:** The component heavily utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), custom hooks (`useLocalStorage`, `useBrandMediaTypes`, `useNotification`), and external UI components (`BrandHeader`, `SentimentBarChart`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`). A `formatDate` utility function is present to convert `YYYY-MM-DD` to `MM-DD-YYYY`, likely for API compatibility.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` to manage various UI states (loading, selected filters, date ranges) and fetched data.
*   **Side Effects:** `useEffect` hooks are crucial for triggering data fetches based on changes in selected filters or time periods.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Loading states are handled gracefully using `Skeleton` components.
*   **Reusable UI Components:** Consistent usage of custom `DropdownComponent` and `MultiSelectDropdown` for user input and filtering across different sections.
*   **API Interaction:** Standardized approach for making API calls using `userService.get` and `userService.post`, with `try...catch` blocks for error handling.
