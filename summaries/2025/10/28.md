# Activity Summary for 10/28/2025

## 10:22:32 AM
On 10/27/2025, several changes were logged within the `skribefrontend` project.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Header\Header.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM):**
    This file, representing the application's header component, underwent substantial development. Key updates include:
    *   **Technology Stack:** Transition to Next.js with `usePathname` and `next/link`, alongside existing React, Redux, and `html-react-parser`.
    *   **Feature Integration:** Extensive import of various UI components and services for functionalities like error handling (`ErrorToast`, `ErrorAlerts`, `useNotification`), session management (`SessionOut`), search (`Searchbar`), chat (`TawkMessenger`), tooltips (`Tooltip`, `LockTooltip`, `HeaderLock`), popups (`MorePower`, `CreatePopup`, `SelectPopup`, `SignupStep`).
    *   **State Management:** Numerous `useState` hooks were introduced or modified to manage UI states such as loading, error messages, dropdown visibility (`socialDropDown`, `campaignDropDown`), online status, mobile menu, user role (`roleType`), remaining freebie days (`remaingDays`), and login status for conditional rendering.
    *   **API Interactions:** Functions for fetching `transferToken` (likely for social logins), `FreeDays` (related to free trial expiry), and `stripAnnouncement` (for active announcements) were implemented.
    *   **Event Handling:** Logic for closing dropdowns when clicking outside (`outSide` function) and handling online/offline status was added.
    *   **Tracking and Analytics:** A `postTracking` function was implemented to send user activity data (userId, pageName, clickId) to a backend service on route changes. Crucially, Google Analytics (GA) tracking was initialized, sending user-specific data (userId, userName) to `G-L6REHKD7DC`, explicitly noted as "GA TRACKING CODE GIVEN BY RAZI ON 06/02/2025 START".
    *   **User Authentication:** An `applogout` function was implemented to clear local storage, remove cookies, and redirect to the home page upon logout.
    *   **Navigation:** A simplified `mainNav` array was present, currently listing "Home" and "MyCRM," with many other navigation items commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\BeforeLoginPages\Auth\SignUp.jsx` (Timestamps: 10/27/2025, 3:18:29 PM, 3:18:36 PM, 3:19:28 PM, 3:19:57 PM, 3:37:39 PM):**
    Across multiple timestamps, the *entire content* of this `SignUp.jsx` file was commented out. This indicates a consistent state where the sign-up functionality (or at least this specific implementation of it, possibly a `FreebiesPage`) was temporarily disabled or moved. The commented-out code reveals a comprehensive sign-up form with features like:
    *   SEO metadata (`useMetadata` with Schema.org).
    *   User input fields for organization, name, email, phone number, and password.
    *   OTP handling with focused input fields and paste functionality.
    *   Robust client-side validation for input lengths, email domain (blocking public emails), and password complexity.
    *   API calls for free signup (`FREESIGNUP`) and fetching user info (`USERINFO`).
    *   Error/message display mechanisms with timeouts.
    *   Local storage interaction for user and user info.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

*   **Consistent Date:** All logged changes occurred on `10/27/2025`, indicating focused development activity on this particular day.
*   **Feature-Rich Components:** Both files, despite one being commented out, showcase complex React components with extensive state management, API integrations, and user interaction logic.
*   **Security and Data Handling:** The emphasis on `localStorage` for user data, `tokenService` for roles, and the filtering of public email domains for signup suggest attention to user session management and data integrity.
*   **Commenting Practices:** The complete commenting out of `SignUp.jsx` is a notable pattern, suggesting either a temporary pause in development on this component, a refactor, or a decision to disable it for a period.
*   **API Service Integration:** Both files extensively interact with `userService` (and `auth.service`, `token.service` in Header.jsx) for backend communication, utilizing constants for API endpoints.
*   **User Experience Focus:** Features like error toasts, session timeouts, diverse tooltip options, and popups (`Header.jsx`) point towards a focus on user feedback and guided interactions.
