# Activity Summary for 10/9/2025

## 12:13:03 AM
The code changes primarily involve two files: `Sentiment.jsx` and `SentimentBarChart.jsx`, both located within `skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\`.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`**

*   **Initial State (10/8/2025, 5:40:07 PM)**: The `SentimentMain` component was introduced as a client-side React component. It initializes various states for managing loading, media types, time periods, selected media types and competitors, a `period` object, and sentiment score data. It defines hardcoded options for media types, time periods, and competitors. An `useEffect` hook was present to fetch brand sentiment scores (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`) based on the selected `period`. Another `useEffect` for fetching sentiment split data (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`) was declared but remained largely empty. The component rendered performance metrics (sentiment score, positive, negative, neutral percentages) and included filter controls and two `NarrativeSection` components.

*   **Minor API Enhancements (10/8/2025, 5:41:12 PM - 5:43:20 PM)**: Over a few commits, the `getSentimentSplitData` `useEffect` was progressively updated. Initially, it was just `userService.post`. Then, the `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE` endpoint was added, followed by an empty object `{}` as a payload, and finally a hardcoded `startDate: "2023-10-01"` within the payload, indicating preparation for actual data fetching.

*   **Recurring Commenting/Uncommenting (10/8/2025, 6:01:01 PM, 6:11:46 PM, 10/8/2025, 11:33:38 PM, 10/9/2025, 12:00:37 AM, 10/9/2025, 12:03:23 AM)**: A notable and recurring pattern across these logs is the complete commenting out and subsequent uncommenting of the entire `Sentiment.jsx` file. This suggests a development workflow where the component was frequently toggled for various reasons, such as disabling it during development of other features, staging, or perhaps testing different versions.

*   **Introduction of Custom Date Range (10/8/2025, 11:42:43 PM - 11:50:26 PM)**:
    *   `startDate` and `endDate` state variables were added.
    *   The `timePeriodOptions` array was extended to include a "Custom Date Range" option.
    *   UI inputs for selecting custom start and end dates were introduced, along with a `dateStatus` state to enable/disable them.
    *   A `handleDateRangeChange` function was implemented to calculate `startDate` and `endDate` based on preset time periods (e.g., "Last 24 hours", "Last 1 month") or to enable custom date selection.
    *   A `handleEndDateChange` function was added to validate that the end date is not earlier than the start date.
    *   The `timePeriod` state was renamed to `dateRange` for better semantic alignment with the new functionality, and the `DropdownComponent`'s setter was updated to `handleDateRangeChange`.

*   **Full API Integration for Sentiment Split Data (10/9/2025, 12:11:46 AM)**: This was a significant update.
    *   New states `sentimentSplitData` and `competitors` were introduced.
    *   The `getSentimentSplitData` `useEffect` was fully implemented to make a POST request to `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`.
    *   The payload now dynamically includes `startDate` (formatted using a new `formatDateForAPI` helper), `endDate`, `filterCompetitors` (mapped from `selectedCompetitors` using `competitors` data), and `media` (from `selectedMediaTypes`).
    *   The API response is used to set `sentimentSplitData` and `competitors`.
    *   The `competitorOptions` array, initially hardcoded, became dynamically populated from the API-fetched `competitors` state.
    *   The `SentimentBarChart` component was integrated to receive `sentimentSplitData` as a prop.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\SentimentBarChart.jsx`**

*   **Initial State (10/8/2025, 6:16:30 PM)**: This component was introduced to render sentiment bar charts using `ReactApexChart`. It used internal hardcoded `sentimentData` for "Brand name" and "Competitor A, B, C". It also featured a popup (`showPopup`) displaying a hardcoded list of `tempArticles` with pagination, representing articles contributing to the sentiment.

*   **Recurring Commenting/Uncommenting (10/8/2025, 11:34:13 PM, 10/9/2025, 12:07:19 AM, 10/9/2025, 12:10:35 AM)**: Similar to `Sentiment.jsx`, this file also saw its entire content repeatedly commented out and uncommented, suggesting a parallel development or testing process.

*   **Refactor for Reusability and Dynamic Data (10/9/2025, 12:09:21 AM)**: The `SentimentBarChart` was refactored to accept `sentimentData` as a prop, making it a generic chart display component.
    *   The internal `sentimentData` state was removed.
    *   The `createSentimentChart` logic was updated to use the structure of the incoming `sentimentData` prop (accessing `company.sentimentData.positive`, etc.).
    *   It now displays a "Loading sentiment data..." message when the `sentimentData` prop is empty.
    *   `articles` and `totalArticles` states were initialized to empty/zero, preparing for dynamic article loading.

*   **Temporary Reversion for Article Data (10/9/2025, 12:11:29 AM)**: Interestingly, shortly after refactoring for dynamic article data, the `articles` state was re-initialized with the `tempArticles` (hardcoded data) and `totalArticles` was set back to `200`. This suggests that while the chart itself was made dynamic, the underlying article list within the popup was temporarily reverted to static data or its dynamic loading was decoupled for later implementation.

**Overall Patterns:**
*   **Modularization and Reusability**: The refactoring of `SentimentBarChart` to accept `sentimentData` as a prop indicates a move towards more modular and reusable components.
*   **Progressive Feature Development**: The `Sentiment.jsx` file shows a clear progression in implementing date range filtering and integrating API calls for sentiment data and competitor information.
*   **Frequent Component Toggling**: The repeated commenting and uncommenting of entire component files is a recurring pattern, possibly indicating an iterative development approach or a method for isolating changes.
*   **API Integration Focus**: A significant portion of the changes revolves around setting up states, preparing payloads, and making API calls (`userService.get`, `userService.post`) to fetch brand sentiment and sentiment split data.
*   **Date Management**: A dedicated effort was made to introduce flexible date range selection, including preset options and custom date inputs with validation.

## 1:12:51 AM
**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`**

*   **Initial Setup and Core Functionality (10/9/2025, 12:20:28 AM - 12:27:29 AM):** The file was established as `SentimentMain`, a React component for displaying brand sentiment. It includes state management for various filters (media types, time periods, competitors), date range selection (`startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`), and data from API calls (`sentimentScoreData`, `sentimentSplitData`). It features a `BrandHeader`, several dropdowns, date inputs, and renders "Performance Metrics" including overall sentiment score, positive, negative, and neutral percentages, along with a `SentimentBarChart` and narrative selection buttons. API calls (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`) are made via `userService`. The `handleDateRangeChange` and `handleEndDateChange` functions manage date logic, with the latter initially using a standard browser `alert()` for validation.
*   **Integration of Notification System (10/9/2025, 12:32:48 AM - 12:33:46 AM):** A significant update involved the integration of a custom notification system. Initially, an incomplete import (`import { showNo }`) was added (12:32:48 AM). This was quickly corrected to `import { useNotification } } from "@/components/ErrorAlert/ErrorContextNotification";` and `showNotification` was destructuring from `useNotification()` (12:33:23 AM). The `alert()` call in `handleEndDateChange` was then replaced with `showNotification("End date cannot be earlier than start date.", "warning");` (12:33:46 AM), standardizing error messaging.
*   **Code Reorganization (10/9/2025, 12:41:16 AM):** The state variable `narrativesPeriod` was moved higher up in the component, likely for better readability and organization of state declarations.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\SentimentBarChart.jsx`**

*   **Core Chart Component and Article Popup (10/9/2025, 12:51:37 AM):** This file defines `SentimentBarChart`, a component responsible for visualizing sentiment data using `react-apexcharts` (dynamically imported). It displays individual sentiment scores for companies using a bar chart (positive, neutral, negative counts). Key features include:
    *   A popup (`showPopup`) that displays a list of "articles that mentioned the Brand" when a chart is clicked.
    *   The popup includes a sentiment type dropdown, a close button, and an `ArticleCard` sub-component for each article.
    *   Pagination controls are implemented for the article list.
    *   Initial fake article data (`tempArticles`) is used.
    *   The main chart container utilizes conditional styling to adapt between a flexbox layout with horizontal scrolling (for `sentimentData.length > 4`) and a grid layout.
*   **Repeated Styling Adjustments and Reversions (10/9/2025, 12:52:01 AM - 12:52:43 AM):** There were several rapid changes related to the Tailwind CSS scrollbar styling on the main chart container. `scrollbar-track-gray-100` was removed, then `scrollbar-thumb-gray-400` was removed, and subsequently, both were re-added. Additionally, a `border` class was removed from individual company chart cards (12:52:31 AM), then no-op commits occurred (12:52:43 AM). This pattern suggests experimentation or minor adjustments to visual presentation.
*   **Temporary UI Duplication and Correction (10/9/2025, 12:53:36 AM - 12:54:41 AM):** A previous commented-out section for rendering sentiment charts was briefly uncommented and made active (12:53:36 AM), leading to a duplicate rendering of the charts. This error was corrected in the subsequent commit (12:54:41 AM), removing the redundant JSX block.
*   **Further Scrollbar Styling Tweaks (10/9/2025, 12:55:01 AM - 12:56:39 AM):** More minor and repetitive changes to the scrollbar styling occurred, with classes like `scrollbar-track-gray-100` and `scrollbar-thumb-gray-400` being removed incrementally, followed by several no-op commits. This reinforces the pattern of fine-tuning CSS.
*   **Chart Axis Scaling Refinement (10/9/2025, 1:00:24 AM - 1:00:39 AM):** The `createSentimentChart` function was updated to adjust the `max` value for the y-axis. It was initially reduced from `+ 10` to `+ 5`, and then further to `+ 2`, affecting the visual scaling of the bar charts by making the bars appear larger relative to the axis maximum.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI/UX Refinement:** A strong focus on improving the user interface and experience is evident, particularly in the `SentimentBarChart` component through visual adjustments, interactive elements (popup, pagination), and chart scaling.
*   **State Management and API Interaction:** Both components heavily rely on React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage component state and interact with backend APIs for data fetching.
*   **Styling Iteration:** Frequent, small changes to Tailwind CSS classes suggest an iterative design process, especially visible in the repeated modifications to scrollbar and card styling.
*   **Error Handling Evolution:** The progression in `Sentiment.jsx` from a native `alert()` to a custom `showNotification()` hook demonstrates an effort to standardize and improve error feedback.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The project utilizes a component-based approach, with distinct components like `BrandHeader`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`, `NarrativeSection`, `SentimentBarChart`, and `ArticleCard`.

## 10:01:57 AM
The log entries show two identical snapshots of the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js` captured within a very short interval on `10/9/2025`, specifically at `9:16:59 AM` and `9:17:06 AM`. This indicates no functional code changes occurred in this file between these two recorded timestamps.

The file itself is a central `constants.js` file for the Skribe frontend application, primarily defining a comprehensive set of API endpoints and a few static configuration values.

Key information from the content:

*   **API Endpoint Management:** The file extensively defines API endpoints as `export const` variables, structured for various application modules. Many base URLs (e.g., `Url_V1`, `ATTACH_URL`, `CHAI_TIME`) are dynamically loaded from environment variables using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...`, indicating a robust configuration setup for different deployment environments.
*   **Module-Specific Grouping:** APIs are logically grouped using comments, reflecting distinct functionalities within the application. These categories include:
    *   **Authentication & User Management:** Login, signup, OTP generation, password reset, user info, refresh token, logout.
    *   **CRM (Customer Relationship Management):** Retrieving and managing CRM data, adding journalists to CRM.
    *   **User Preferences/Settings:** APIs for user preferences, geographical data, media types, beats, competitors, topics, brands, and spokespersons.
    *   **Reporting:** APIs for brand, influencer, spokesperson, and topic-based reporting, including article aggregations and trending data.
    *   **Campaign Management:** Creating, retrieving, updating, deleting campaigns, managing lists, attachments, email quotas, and tracking. This includes `SendMailByJourIDs` for email sending.
    *   **Search Functionality:** Advanced search, filtering journalists by various criteria, and retrieving regional journalists.
    *   **Content & Media:** APIs for beatwatch articles, outlet supplements, Skribe Extra content, podcasts, and contact forms.
    *   **Dashboard & Analytics:** Usage statistics, trending journalists, Skribe365 content, and favorite journalists.
    *   **Social Media Integration:** Dedicated sections for Instagram (influencer profiles, search) and Twitter (media, city, outlet, beat filters).
    *   **SmartProfile:** Detailed journalist portfolio information, spokespersons, topics, and brands related to journalists.
    *   **Geo-specific Data:** Geographical statistics, media density, and outlet information.
    *   **Brand Dashboard:** Language-wise analysis, sentiment scores, share of voice, city-wise media counts, top journalists by brand, and brand articles.
    *   **Brand/Spokesperson Tracking:** APIs to add, deactivate, and manage brands, spokespersons, and associated keywords, including competitor management.
    *   **Media List Management:** Creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, duplicating, and sharing media lists.
*   **Static Constants:** A `STATICCOUNT` of `1000` is defined, likely used for "select all" button functionalities. A constant `Freebies` is also defined.
*   **URL Structure:** Almost all endpoints consistently use the `/v1/` prefix, indicating versioning for the API.
*   **Development Comments:** There are commented-out lines (e.g., `//LOCAL //const prefixUrl = "https://localhost:44323/v1/";`) which likely served for local development or testing purposes, showing a `localhost` URL and a "Beta host name IP Address" comment.

## 11:35:41 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant2.html` is an HTML email template for "Skribe - Connecting Newsmakers to Newsmedia," which underwent several iterations on 10/9/2025.

**Initial State (10/9/2025, 10:36:34 AM):**
The email begins with a personal introduction from Dishant, the Strategy and Execution Lead at Skribe, outlining the challenge of getting client stories published and introducing Skribe's three service options: "Paid Media Placements," "Organic Editorial Coverage," and "Print Media Dissemination." Each service includes a brief description and a link to a Google Sheet for more details. The email concludes with a standard sign-off, a contact link, and social media icons.

**Evolution of Content (10/9/2025, 10:38:55 AM - 10:40:33 AM):**
*   **10:38:55 AM:** The personal introduction and problem statement were replaced with a more direct opening: "Here’s a quick look at the kind of placements we deliver. These are real campaigns we’ve executed recently:". This shifted the email's focus from an introductory message to showcasing practical examples.
*   **10:39:21 AM:** The heading for "1. Paid Media Placements" was changed to "Business World," marking the beginning of a transition from listing service categories to listing specific media outlets as examples.
*   **10:40:15 AM:** "Economic Times" was added as another example. The detailed descriptions and links associated with "Business World" (previously "Paid Media Placements") and "2. Organic Editorial Coverage" were removed, retaining only the `<h3>` headings.
*   **10:40:33 AM:** "Zee News" was added to the list of media examples, continuing the pattern of replacing service details with publication names.

**Major Restructuring and Refinement (10/9/2025, 10:43:32 AM):**
This timestamp marks a significant content and structural overhaul of the main body:
*   The individual `div` elements for media examples (Business World, Economic Times, Zee News) were transformed into an unordered list (`<ul>`) of clickable links, now including "DNA India" as well, all directing to actual published articles on those platforms.
*   A new explanatory paragraph was added: "Your article will go live in the same format — proper editorial placement on credible platforms, exactly where audiences and clients pay attention."
*   The three original service options ("Paid Media Placements," "Organic Editorial Coverage," "Print Media Dissemination") were reintroduced as a second unordered list, each linking to its respective Google Sheet and now explicitly including its descriptive text next to the link.
*   The sign-off was expanded from "Dishant Bhasin" to "Dishant" followed by "Strategy & Execution Lead" and "Skribe" on separate lines, formatted with slightly smaller font sizes.
*   The contact link text was slightly rephrased and its color adjusted.

**Final Functional Update (10/9/2025, 10:45:15 AM):**
All external links (media placements, service option sheets, and the contact link) were updated to include the `target="_blank"` attribute, ensuring they open in a new browser tab or window.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   The file consistently serves as an HTML email template, utilizing inline CSS for styling.
*   The header (Skribe logo, title, blue background) and the footer (social media links for X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and a concluding blue bar) remained largely consistent throughout the changes.
*   Links to Google Sheets are a recurring method for providing detailed information on pricing and media outlets.
*   The primary objective of the email remained showcasing Skribe's media placement services, evolving from a general introduction to a more structured presentation with real-world examples and clear service offerings.

## 12:02:24 PM
The changes primarily focus on the front-end components related to brand analytics, specifically "Sentiment" and "Share of Voice," and updates to API constants.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`** (Timestamp: 10/9/2025, 11:34:30 AM & 11:55:11 AM)
    *   **Functionality:** This component, `SentimentMain`, is responsible for displaying brand sentiment scores and splits. It includes a brand header, performance metrics (sentiment score, positive, negative, neutral percentages), filter controls for media type and time period (including custom date ranges), a sentiment bar chart, and narrative sections.
    *   **Key Logic:**
        *   Manages various state variables for loading, selected media types, time periods, date ranges, and fetched sentiment data (`sentimentScoreData`, `sentimentSplitData`, `competitors`).
        *   Includes functions (`handleDateRangeChange`, `handleEndDateChange`, `formatDateForAPI`) for dynamic date range selection and formatting.
        *   Uses `useEffect` hooks to fetch `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE` based on a selected period and `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE` based on selected media types, competitors, and date ranges.
        *   Integrates `useBrandMediaTypes` custom hook and `useNotification` context.
    *   **Timestamp Highlight:** The initial major implementation of the sentiment dashboard logic. No functional changes occurred between the two timestamps for this file.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`** (Multiple timestamps from 10/9/2025, 11:42:15 AM to 12:00:29 PM)
    *   **Evolution:** This component, `MonthShareOfVoice`, shows a "Month Share of Voice — 6 months" bar chart. It underwent several iterative changes:
        *   **11:42:15 AM:** Initial implementation with hardcoded `competitorOptions` and `barChartData`. `mediaTypeOptions` was undefined locally.
        *   **11:42:34 AM:** Imported `useBrandMediaTypes` custom hook, indicating an intention to use it for media type options.
        *   **11:42:51 AM:** Integrated `useBrandMediaTypes` to dynamically get `mediaTypeOptions`.
        *   **11:44:29 AM:** Simplified `competitorOptions` from an array of objects to an array of strings.
        *   **11:48:27 AM:** Refactored the component to accept `mediaTypeOptions` as a prop instead of fetching them internally via the custom hook, making it more reusable. The local `useBrandMediaTypes` import and usage were removed.
        *   **11:50:49 AM:** Imported `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` constant and `userService` to prepare for API data fetching.
        *   **11:53:08 AM - 11:54:17 AM:** Introduced a `useEffect` hook to call `userService.post(GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE)` with `selectedMediaTypes` and `selectedCompetitors` in the payload. A new state `shareOfVoiceData` was added to store the API response, with the condition `if (res?.response?.status === "Ok") { }` being refined.
        *   **11:55:55 AM - 11:57:00 AM:** Added `competitors` state. The `shareOfVoiceData` state was correctly set from `res?.data`, and logic was added to populate the `competitors` state from `res?.competitors` in the API response. A `console.log` for "Sentiment Split Data" was added, likely a copy-paste error from the Sentiment component.
        *   **11:58:11 AM - 11:58:27 AM:** The payload keys for the API call were adjusted from `mediaTypes` to `media` and `competitors` to `filterCompetitors` to align with backend API expectations.
        *   **12:00:29 PM:** The "Select Competitor" `MultiSelectDropdown` was updated to use the dynamically fetched `competitors` state as its options, replacing the hardcoded list.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`** (Timestamp: 10/9/2025, 11:47:23 AM)
    *   **Functionality:** This is the parent `ShareofVoice` component that integrates `MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, and `TopJournalists`.
    *   **Key Logic:**
        *   Manages `lastDays` and `selectedMediaTypes` states.
        *   Includes hardcoded `mediaTypeOptions`, `timePeriodOptions`, `brandJournalists`, and `competitionJournalists`.
        *   Passes `mediaTypeOptions` to `MonthShareOfVoice` as a prop, demonstrating the change made in `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` at 11:48:27 AM.
    *   **Timestamp Highlight:** This commit represents the assembly of the "Share of Voice" dashboard, bringing together sub-components and defining their filtering capabilities.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`** (Timestamp: 10/9/2025, 11:49:33 AM & 11:49:54 AM)
    *   **Purpose:** This file defines a large number of API endpoints for various functionalities across the application.
    *   **Content:** Covers authentication, user preferences, CRM, campaign management, reporting (brand, influencer, spokesperson, topic), search, dashboard stats, social media integrations (Instagram, Twitter), and geo-statistics.
    *   **New Endpoints:** `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE` (for `Sentiment.jsx`), and `SHAREVOICE` (which seems to be the constant `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` used in `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`). Many other specific endpoints for different features are also defined.
    *   **Timestamp Highlight:** These entries show a comprehensive set of API endpoints, indicating a well-structured backend interaction layer. No changes were observed between the two timestamps for this file.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Component-based Architecture:** The application heavily relies on React functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
*   **Dynamic Data Fetching:** A clear pattern of fetching data asynchronously using `userService.get` and `userService.post` is evident. API responses are checked for `res?.response?.status === "Ok"`.
*   **Filter Controls:** `MultiSelectDropdown` and `DropdownComponent` are consistently used across different dashboards (`Sentiment`, `ShareofVoice`) for filtering data by media type, time period, and competitors.
*   **Date Handling:** Custom logic for date range selection and formatting (`dd-MM-yyyy`) is used to prepare data for API calls.
*   **Data Visualization:** `react-apexcharts` is utilized for rendering charts, with dynamic imports for SSR compatibility.
*   **Constants for API Endpoints:** All API endpoints are centralized in `src/constants.js`, promoting maintainability and preventing hardcoding of URLs within components.
*   **Iterative Development:** The `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` file demonstrates an iterative development process, starting with hardcoded data and gradually integrating dynamic data fetching, prop-based configuration, and API interaction. This includes refining API payload structures (`competitors` to `filterCompetitors`, `mediaTypes` to `media`).
