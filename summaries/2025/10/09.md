# Activity Summary for 10/9/2025

## 12:13:03 AM
The code changes primarily involve two files: `Sentiment.jsx` and `SentimentBarChart.jsx`, both located within `skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\`.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`**

*   **Initial State (10/8/2025, 5:40:07 PM)**: The `SentimentMain` component was introduced as a client-side React component. It initializes various states for managing loading, media types, time periods, selected media types and competitors, a `period` object, and sentiment score data. It defines hardcoded options for media types, time periods, and competitors. An `useEffect` hook was present to fetch brand sentiment scores (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`) based on the selected `period`. Another `useEffect` for fetching sentiment split data (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`) was declared but remained largely empty. The component rendered performance metrics (sentiment score, positive, negative, neutral percentages) and included filter controls and two `NarrativeSection` components.

*   **Minor API Enhancements (10/8/2025, 5:41:12 PM - 5:43:20 PM)**: Over a few commits, the `getSentimentSplitData` `useEffect` was progressively updated. Initially, it was just `userService.post`. Then, the `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE` endpoint was added, followed by an empty object `{}` as a payload, and finally a hardcoded `startDate: "2023-10-01"` within the payload, indicating preparation for actual data fetching.

*   **Recurring Commenting/Uncommenting (10/8/2025, 6:01:01 PM, 6:11:46 PM, 10/8/2025, 11:33:38 PM, 10/9/2025, 12:00:37 AM, 10/9/2025, 12:03:23 AM)**: A notable and recurring pattern across these logs is the complete commenting out and subsequent uncommenting of the entire `Sentiment.jsx` file. This suggests a development workflow where the component was frequently toggled for various reasons, such as disabling it during development of other features, staging, or perhaps testing different versions.

*   **Introduction of Custom Date Range (10/8/2025, 11:42:43 PM - 11:50:26 PM)**:
    *   `startDate` and `endDate` state variables were added.
    *   The `timePeriodOptions` array was extended to include a "Custom Date Range" option.
    *   UI inputs for selecting custom start and end dates were introduced, along with a `dateStatus` state to enable/disable them.
    *   A `handleDateRangeChange` function was implemented to calculate `startDate` and `endDate` based on preset time periods (e.g., "Last 24 hours", "Last 1 month") or to enable custom date selection.
    *   A `handleEndDateChange` function was added to validate that the end date is not earlier than the start date.
    *   The `timePeriod` state was renamed to `dateRange` for better semantic alignment with the new functionality, and the `DropdownComponent`'s setter was updated to `handleDateRangeChange`.

*   **Full API Integration for Sentiment Split Data (10/9/2025, 12:11:46 AM)**: This was a significant update.
    *   New states `sentimentSplitData` and `competitors` were introduced.
    *   The `getSentimentSplitData` `useEffect` was fully implemented to make a POST request to `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`.
    *   The payload now dynamically includes `startDate` (formatted using a new `formatDateForAPI` helper), `endDate`, `filterCompetitors` (mapped from `selectedCompetitors` using `competitors` data), and `media` (from `selectedMediaTypes`).
    *   The API response is used to set `sentimentSplitData` and `competitors`.
    *   The `competitorOptions` array, initially hardcoded, became dynamically populated from the API-fetched `competitors` state.
    *   The `SentimentBarChart` component was integrated to receive `sentimentSplitData` as a prop.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\SentimentBarChart.jsx`**

*   **Initial State (10/8/2025, 6:16:30 PM)**: This component was introduced to render sentiment bar charts using `ReactApexChart`. It used internal hardcoded `sentimentData` for "Brand name" and "Competitor A, B, C". It also featured a popup (`showPopup`) displaying a hardcoded list of `tempArticles` with pagination, representing articles contributing to the sentiment.

*   **Recurring Commenting/Uncommenting (10/8/2025, 11:34:13 PM, 10/9/2025, 12:07:19 AM, 10/9/2025, 12:10:35 AM)**: Similar to `Sentiment.jsx`, this file also saw its entire content repeatedly commented out and uncommented, suggesting a parallel development or testing process.

*   **Refactor for Reusability and Dynamic Data (10/9/2025, 12:09:21 AM)**: The `SentimentBarChart` was refactored to accept `sentimentData` as a prop, making it a generic chart display component.
    *   The internal `sentimentData` state was removed.
    *   The `createSentimentChart` logic was updated to use the structure of the incoming `sentimentData` prop (accessing `company.sentimentData.positive`, etc.).
    *   It now displays a "Loading sentiment data..." message when the `sentimentData` prop is empty.
    *   `articles` and `totalArticles` states were initialized to empty/zero, preparing for dynamic article loading.

*   **Temporary Reversion for Article Data (10/9/2025, 12:11:29 AM)**: Interestingly, shortly after refactoring for dynamic article data, the `articles` state was re-initialized with the `tempArticles` (hardcoded data) and `totalArticles` was set back to `200`. This suggests that while the chart itself was made dynamic, the underlying article list within the popup was temporarily reverted to static data or its dynamic loading was decoupled for later implementation.

**Overall Patterns:**
*   **Modularization and Reusability**: The refactoring of `SentimentBarChart` to accept `sentimentData` as a prop indicates a move towards more modular and reusable components.
*   **Progressive Feature Development**: The `Sentiment.jsx` file shows a clear progression in implementing date range filtering and integrating API calls for sentiment data and competitor information.
*   **Frequent Component Toggling**: The repeated commenting and uncommenting of entire component files is a recurring pattern, possibly indicating an iterative development approach or a method for isolating changes.
*   **API Integration Focus**: A significant portion of the changes revolves around setting up states, preparing payloads, and making API calls (`userService.get`, `userService.post`) to fetch brand sentiment and sentiment split data.
*   **Date Management**: A dedicated effort was made to introduce flexible date range selection, including preset options and custom date inputs with validation.
