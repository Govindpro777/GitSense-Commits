# Activity Summary for 10/9/2025

## 12:13:03 AM
The code changes primarily involve two files: `Sentiment.jsx` and `SentimentBarChart.jsx`, both located within `skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\`.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`**

*   **Initial State (10/8/2025, 5:40:07 PM)**: The `SentimentMain` component was introduced as a client-side React component. It initializes various states for managing loading, media types, time periods, selected media types and competitors, a `period` object, and sentiment score data. It defines hardcoded options for media types, time periods, and competitors. An `useEffect` hook was present to fetch brand sentiment scores (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`) based on the selected `period`. Another `useEffect` for fetching sentiment split data (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`) was declared but remained largely empty. The component rendered performance metrics (sentiment score, positive, negative, neutral percentages) and included filter controls and two `NarrativeSection` components.

*   **Minor API Enhancements (10/8/2025, 5:41:12 PM - 5:43:20 PM)**: Over a few commits, the `getSentimentSplitData` `useEffect` was progressively updated. Initially, it was just `userService.post`. Then, the `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE` endpoint was added, followed by an empty object `{}` as a payload, and finally a hardcoded `startDate: "2023-10-01"` within the payload, indicating preparation for actual data fetching.

*   **Recurring Commenting/Uncommenting (10/8/2025, 6:01:01 PM, 6:11:46 PM, 10/8/2025, 11:33:38 PM, 10/9/2025, 12:00:37 AM, 10/9/2025, 12:03:23 AM)**: A notable and recurring pattern across these logs is the complete commenting out and subsequent uncommenting of the entire `Sentiment.jsx` file. This suggests a development workflow where the component was frequently toggled for various reasons, such as disabling it during development of other features, staging, or perhaps testing different versions.

*   **Introduction of Custom Date Range (10/8/2025, 11:42:43 PM - 11:50:26 PM)**:
    *   `startDate` and `endDate` state variables were added.
    *   The `timePeriodOptions` array was extended to include a "Custom Date Range" option.
    *   UI inputs for selecting custom start and end dates were introduced, along with a `dateStatus` state to enable/disable them.
    *   A `handleDateRangeChange` function was implemented to calculate `startDate` and `endDate` based on preset time periods (e.g., "Last 24 hours", "Last 1 month") or to enable custom date selection.
    *   A `handleEndDateChange` function was added to validate that the end date is not earlier than the start date.
    *   The `timePeriod` state was renamed to `dateRange` for better semantic alignment with the new functionality, and the `DropdownComponent`'s setter was updated to `handleDateRangeChange`.

*   **Full API Integration for Sentiment Split Data (10/9/2025, 12:11:46 AM)**: This was a significant update.
    *   New states `sentimentSplitData` and `competitors` were introduced.
    *   The `getSentimentSplitData` `useEffect` was fully implemented to make a POST request to `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`.
    *   The payload now dynamically includes `startDate` (formatted using a new `formatDateForAPI` helper), `endDate`, `filterCompetitors` (mapped from `selectedCompetitors` using `competitors` data), and `media` (from `selectedMediaTypes`).
    *   The API response is used to set `sentimentSplitData` and `competitors`.
    *   The `competitorOptions` array, initially hardcoded, became dynamically populated from the API-fetched `competitors` state.
    *   The `SentimentBarChart` component was integrated to receive `sentimentSplitData` as a prop.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\SentimentBarChart.jsx`**

*   **Initial State (10/8/2025, 6:16:30 PM)**: This component was introduced to render sentiment bar charts using `ReactApexChart`. It used internal hardcoded `sentimentData` for "Brand name" and "Competitor A, B, C". It also featured a popup (`showPopup`) displaying a hardcoded list of `tempArticles` with pagination, representing articles contributing to the sentiment.

*   **Recurring Commenting/Uncommenting (10/8/2025, 11:34:13 PM, 10/9/2025, 12:07:19 AM, 10/9/2025, 12:10:35 AM)**: Similar to `Sentiment.jsx`, this file also saw its entire content repeatedly commented out and uncommented, suggesting a parallel development or testing process.

*   **Refactor for Reusability and Dynamic Data (10/9/2025, 12:09:21 AM)**: The `SentimentBarChart` was refactored to accept `sentimentData` as a prop, making it a generic chart display component.
    *   The internal `sentimentData` state was removed.
    *   The `createSentimentChart` logic was updated to use the structure of the incoming `sentimentData` prop (accessing `company.sentimentData.positive`, etc.).
    *   It now displays a "Loading sentiment data..." message when the `sentimentData` prop is empty.
    *   `articles` and `totalArticles` states were initialized to empty/zero, preparing for dynamic article loading.

*   **Temporary Reversion for Article Data (10/9/2025, 12:11:29 AM)**: Interestingly, shortly after refactoring for dynamic article data, the `articles` state was re-initialized with the `tempArticles` (hardcoded data) and `totalArticles` was set back to `200`. This suggests that while the chart itself was made dynamic, the underlying article list within the popup was temporarily reverted to static data or its dynamic loading was decoupled for later implementation.

**Overall Patterns:**
*   **Modularization and Reusability**: The refactoring of `SentimentBarChart` to accept `sentimentData` as a prop indicates a move towards more modular and reusable components.
*   **Progressive Feature Development**: The `Sentiment.jsx` file shows a clear progression in implementing date range filtering and integrating API calls for sentiment data and competitor information.
*   **Frequent Component Toggling**: The repeated commenting and uncommenting of entire component files is a recurring pattern, possibly indicating an iterative development approach or a method for isolating changes.
*   **API Integration Focus**: A significant portion of the changes revolves around setting up states, preparing payloads, and making API calls (`userService.get`, `userService.post`) to fetch brand sentiment and sentiment split data.
*   **Date Management**: A dedicated effort was made to introduce flexible date range selection, including preset options and custom date inputs with validation.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`**

*   **Initial Setup and Core Functionality (10/9/2025, 12:20:28 AM - 12:27:29 AM):** The file was established as `SentimentMain`, a React component for displaying brand sentiment. It includes state management for various filters (media types, time periods, competitors), date range selection (`startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`), and data from API calls (`sentimentScoreData`, `sentimentSplitData`). It features a `BrandHeader`, several dropdowns, date inputs, and renders "Performance Metrics" including overall sentiment score, positive, negative, and neutral percentages, along with a `SentimentBarChart` and narrative selection buttons. API calls (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SPLIT_SCORE`) are made via `userService`. The `handleDateRangeChange` and `handleEndDateChange` functions manage date logic, with the latter initially using a standard browser `alert()` for validation.
*   **Integration of Notification System (10/9/2025, 12:32:48 AM - 12:33:46 AM):** A significant update involved the integration of a custom notification system. Initially, an incomplete import (`import { showNo }`) was added (12:32:48 AM). This was quickly corrected to `import { useNotification } } from "@/components/ErrorAlert/ErrorContextNotification";` and `showNotification` was destructuring from `useNotification()` (12:33:23 AM). The `alert()` call in `handleEndDateChange` was then replaced with `showNotification("End date cannot be earlier than start date.", "warning");` (12:33:46 AM), standardizing error messaging.
*   **Code Reorganization (10/9/2025, 12:41:16 AM):** The state variable `narrativesPeriod` was moved higher up in the component, likely for better readability and organization of state declarations.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\SentimentBarChart.jsx`**

*   **Core Chart Component and Article Popup (10/9/2025, 12:51:37 AM):** This file defines `SentimentBarChart`, a component responsible for visualizing sentiment data using `react-apexcharts` (dynamically imported). It displays individual sentiment scores for companies using a bar chart (positive, neutral, negative counts). Key features include:
    *   A popup (`showPopup`) that displays a list of "articles that mentioned the Brand" when a chart is clicked.
    *   The popup includes a sentiment type dropdown, a close button, and an `ArticleCard` sub-component for each article.
    *   Pagination controls are implemented for the article list.
    *   Initial fake article data (`tempArticles`) is used.
    *   The main chart container utilizes conditional styling to adapt between a flexbox layout with horizontal scrolling (for `sentimentData.length > 4`) and a grid layout.
*   **Repeated Styling Adjustments and Reversions (10/9/2025, 12:52:01 AM - 12:52:43 AM):** There were several rapid changes related to the Tailwind CSS scrollbar styling on the main chart container. `scrollbar-track-gray-100` was removed, then `scrollbar-thumb-gray-400` was removed, and subsequently, both were re-added. Additionally, a `border` class was removed from individual company chart cards (12:52:31 AM), then no-op commits occurred (12:52:43 AM). This pattern suggests experimentation or minor adjustments to visual presentation.
*   **Temporary UI Duplication and Correction (10/9/2025, 12:53:36 AM - 12:54:41 AM):** A previous commented-out section for rendering sentiment charts was briefly uncommented and made active (12:53:36 AM), leading to a duplicate rendering of the charts. This error was corrected in the subsequent commit (12:54:41 AM), removing the redundant JSX block.
*   **Further Scrollbar Styling Tweaks (10/9/2025, 12:55:01 AM - 12:56:39 AM):** More minor and repetitive changes to the scrollbar styling occurred, with classes like `scrollbar-track-gray-100` and `scrollbar-thumb-gray-400` being removed incrementally, followed by several no-op commits. This reinforces the pattern of fine-tuning CSS.
*   **Chart Axis Scaling Refinement (10/9/2025, 1:00:24 AM - 1:00:39 AM):** The `createSentimentChart` function was updated to adjust the `max` value for the y-axis. It was initially reduced from `+ 10` to `+ 5`, and then further to `+ 2`, affecting the visual scaling of the bar charts by making the bars appear larger relative to the axis maximum.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI/UX Refinement:** A strong focus on improving the user interface and experience is evident, particularly in the `SentimentBarChart` component through visual adjustments, interactive elements (popup, pagination), and chart scaling.
*   **State Management and API Interaction:** Both components heavily rely on React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage component state and interact with backend APIs for data fetching.
*   **Styling Iteration:** Frequent, small changes to Tailwind CSS classes suggest an iterative design process, especially visible in the repeated modifications to scrollbar and card styling.
*   **Error Handling Evolution:** The progression in `Sentiment.jsx` from a native `alert()` to a custom `showNotification()` hook demonstrates an effort to standardize and improve error feedback.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The project utilizes a component-based approach, with distinct components like `BrandHeader`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`, `NarrativeSection`, `SentimentBarChart`, and `ArticleCard`.
