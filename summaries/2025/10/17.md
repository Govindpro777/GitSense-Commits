# Activity Summary for 10/17/2025

## 9:12:56 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Narrative.jsx` underwent a significant change on `10/17/2025, 12:51:47 AM`.

The primary update involves uncommenting the entire `NarrativeSection` React component, effectively reintroducing or activating this component in the codebase. This component is responsible for displaying narratives, either for a brand or its competitors, categorized by sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) with corresponding color indications. Each narrative card includes details such as mentioned outlets, authors, headlines, summaries, and reference links. A loading skeleton is implemented to enhance user experience while data is being fetched.

A specific functional enhancement was introduced within the `Competitor Narratives` rendering logic. Beyond checking if `competitorsNarrativeData` is null or empty, there's now an additional check (`hasAnyNarratives`) to determine if *any* competitor within the `competitorsNarrativeData` array actually contains narratives. This ensures that the "No Record Found" message is displayed more accurately when there are no competitor narratives to show, even if the competitor data structure itself exists.

## 10:12:55 AM
The `Narrative.jsx` file, last updated on 10/17/2025 at 9:17:24 AM, defines a React component named `NarrativeSection`. This component is designed to display either brand-specific or competitor-specific narratives, likely within a sentiment analysis context.

Key functionalities and patterns include:

*   **Conditional Data Display**: The component dynamically renders content based on a `narrativesPeriod` prop, which can be "Company Narratives" or "Competitor Narratives".
*   **Loading State Management**: It integrates `react-loading-skeleton` to provide a visual loading indicator, showing a set of skeleton cards while data is being fetched.
*   **Narrative Card Rendering**: A `renderNarrativeCard` function is responsible for structuring and displaying detailed information about each narrative. This includes:
    *   **Sentiment**: Color-coded (positive, negative, neutral) and displayed prominently.
    *   **Outlet and Timeline**: Mentions the number of outlets and the latest date.
    *   **Content**: Headline, authors, a summary, and a list of reference article links.
    *   **Styling**: Uses a consistent design for outlets and links.
*   **Sentiment Coloring Logic**: A `getSentimentColor` helper function assigns specific Tailwind CSS text colors (`text-[#16A34A]` for positive, `text-[#EF4444]` for negative, `text-[#EAB308]` for neutral) based on the sentiment string.
*   **"No Record Found" State**: If no narrative data is available for the selected period (either brand or competitors), a clear "No Record Found" message is displayed.
*   **Competitor Data Structure**: When displaying competitor narratives, the component iterates through an array of competitor objects, each potentially containing its own array of narratives.
*   **Robust Data Handling**: The component includes checks for `null` or `undefined` data properties (e.g., `narrative.mentionedOutlets?.length || 0`, `narrative.authors?.join(" | ") || "No authors available"`) to prevent errors and display fallback text.
*   **External Links**: Reference links for narratives are rendered as clickable `<a>` tags that open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`).
*   **UI/UX**: The component prioritizes a clear and organized presentation of complex data, featuring distinct sections for narrative details and reference links, all styled with what appears to be Tailwind CSS classes.
