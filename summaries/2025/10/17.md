# Activity Summary for 10/17/2025

## 9:12:56 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Narrative.jsx` underwent a significant change on `10/17/2025, 12:51:47 AM`.

The primary update involves uncommenting the entire `NarrativeSection` React component, effectively reintroducing or activating this component in the codebase. This component is responsible for displaying narratives, either for a brand or its competitors, categorized by sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) with corresponding color indications. Each narrative card includes details such as mentioned outlets, authors, headlines, summaries, and reference links. A loading skeleton is implemented to enhance user experience while data is being fetched.

A specific functional enhancement was introduced within the `Competitor Narratives` rendering logic. Beyond checking if `competitorsNarrativeData` is null or empty, there's now an additional check (`hasAnyNarratives`) to determine if *any* competitor within the `competitorsNarrativeData` array actually contains narratives. This ensures that the "No Record Found" message is displayed more accurately when there are no competitor narratives to show, even if the competitor data structure itself exists.
