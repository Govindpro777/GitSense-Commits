# Activity Summary for 10/17/2025

## 9:12:56 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Narrative.jsx` underwent a significant change on `10/17/2025, 12:51:47 AM`.

The primary update involves uncommenting the entire `NarrativeSection` React component, effectively reintroducing or activating this component in the codebase. This component is responsible for displaying narratives, either for a brand or its competitors, categorized by sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) with corresponding color indications. Each narrative card includes details such as mentioned outlets, authors, headlines, summaries, and reference links. A loading skeleton is implemented to enhance user experience while data is being fetched.

A specific functional enhancement was introduced within the `Competitor Narratives` rendering logic. Beyond checking if `competitorsNarrativeData` is null or empty, there's now an additional check (`hasAnyNarratives`) to determine if *any* competitor within the `competitorsNarrativeData` array actually contains narratives. This ensures that the "No Record Found" message is displayed more accurately when there are no competitor narratives to show, even if the competitor data structure itself exists.

## 10:12:55 AM
The `Narrative.jsx` file, last updated on 10/17/2025 at 9:17:24 AM, defines a React component named `NarrativeSection`. This component is designed to display either brand-specific or competitor-specific narratives, likely within a sentiment analysis context.

Key functionalities and patterns include:

*   **Conditional Data Display**: The component dynamically renders content based on a `narrativesPeriod` prop, which can be "Company Narratives" or "Competitor Narratives".
*   **Loading State Management**: It integrates `react-loading-skeleton` to provide a visual loading indicator, showing a set of skeleton cards while data is being fetched.
*   **Narrative Card Rendering**: A `renderNarrativeCard` function is responsible for structuring and displaying detailed information about each narrative. This includes:
    *   **Sentiment**: Color-coded (positive, negative, neutral) and displayed prominently.
    *   **Outlet and Timeline**: Mentions the number of outlets and the latest date.
    *   **Content**: Headline, authors, a summary, and a list of reference article links.
    *   **Styling**: Uses a consistent design for outlets and links.
*   **Sentiment Coloring Logic**: A `getSentimentColor` helper function assigns specific Tailwind CSS text colors (`text-[#16A34A]` for positive, `text-[#EF4444]` for negative, `text-[#EAB308]` for neutral) based on the sentiment string.
*   **"No Record Found" State**: If no narrative data is available for the selected period (either brand or competitors), a clear "No Record Found" message is displayed.
*   **Competitor Data Structure**: When displaying competitor narratives, the component iterates through an array of competitor objects, each potentially containing its own array of narratives.
*   **Robust Data Handling**: The component includes checks for `null` or `undefined` data properties (e.g., `narrative.mentionedOutlets?.length || 0`, `narrative.authors?.join(" | ") || "No authors available"`) to prevent errors and display fallback text.
*   **External Links**: Reference links for narratives are rendered as clickable `<a>` tags that open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`).
*   **UI/UX**: The component prioritizes a clear and organized presentation of complex data, featuring distinct sections for narrative details and reference links, all styled with what appears to be Tailwind CSS classes.

## 10:38:52 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Diwali\socion1.html` underwent numerous rapid changes, primarily revolving around two distinct email marketing campaigns: an initial "Campaign Insights" email and subsequent, iterative refinements to a "Free Trial Ending Soon" email. All modifications occurred on 10/17/2025, within a span of approximately 30 minutes.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **10/17/2025, 10:06:21 AM:** The initial version of the HTML file was a "Campaign Insights" email. It featured a progress bar indicating "50% there", a main heading about a live campaign and tracking success, bullet points for engagement stats, influencer metrics, and campaign insights, and a call-to-action button to "Check Your Campaign Results". It included a Socion logo and standard social media links, powered by Skribe.
*   **10/17/2025, 10:13:10 AM:** A major shift occurred, transforming the email into a "Free Trial Ending Soon" notification. The title and core message changed to inform the user that their trial was ending and introduced a "1-month money-back guarantee" to encourage upgrading. New CSS classes were added for the trial banner and guarantee badges. The progress bar was replaced with a prominent "YOUR FREE TRIAL'S ENDING SOON" banner and "CONTINUE WITH ZERO RISK" text. The main content detailed how the guarantee works, presented as bullet points, and the call-to-action became "Upgrade Now".
*   **10/17/2025, 10:15:46 AM:** This entry shows a significant structural and visual redesign, though the log entry is truncated. The overall email wrapper changed to a `max-width` of `600px` with a white background, shadows, and rounded corners, set against a light gray `body` background. The header area was redesigned with a custom logo (chat bubble icon and "Socion" text instead of the image logo) and a complex, entirely HTML-drawn illustration (a person with a laptop and floating badges) replaced the `socion-new1.png` image. Bullet points for the guarantee were also visually updated using `div` elements instead of image bullets. Colors for the trial banner and CTA button were adjusted.
*   **10/17/2025, 10:17:21 AM:** The design largely reverted from the radical changes made at 10:15:46 AM. The email template returned to the `700px` max-width, reinstated the original Socion logo image and the `socion-new1.png` illustration. The "Trial banner" and "Zero risk text" returned to their previous styles. The bullet points were modified to use custom `<span>` elements for dots within `<li>` tags, rather than `<img>` or the more complex `div` structure from the previous commit. The greeting also personalized from "{firstname}" to "Dishant".
*   **10/17/2025, 10:17:53 AM to 10:35:08 AM:** A series of minor, iterative adjustments were made to the "Free Trial Ending Soon" email template, primarily focusing on styling and layout:
    *   **Button Color:** The CTA button color was changed from `#E86D70` to `#E23A27` and remained consistent thereafter.
    *   **Header Content Repositioning:** A brief, erroneous removal and subsequent restoration of the "Trial banner" from the header (10:18:18 AM, 10:18:27 AM).
    *   **Text Colors:** The "Zero risk text" color was adjusted multiple times (`#8B4513` to `#E86D70`, then back to `#AC2B0F`).
    *   **Trial Banner Text Formatting:** A minor attempt to reformat the "YOUR FREE TRIAL'S ENDING SOON" text (10:25:03 AM), which was then reverted (10:25:28 AM).
    *   **Padding and Background:** Numerous small tweaks to the padding of various table cells (`<td>`) and the introduction of an inner `div` with a light gray background (`#F9FAFB`) and its padding adjustments within the main content section (from 10:28:39 AM to 10:33:21 AM).
    *   **Bullet Point Styling:** Slight modifications to the `line-height` of bullet points (10:34:03 AM) and the size of the bullet `<span>` elements (10:34:29 AM, then reverted at 10:34:57 AM).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Email Template Focus:** The changes indicate a strong focus on designing and refining HTML email templates, likely for marketing or user engagement purposes (campaign feedback vs. trial conversion).
*   **Consistent Branding:** "Socion" branding, including logos and mentions in text, along with "Powered by: skribe" and social media links, remained constant across most versions.
*   **Inline Styling:** The extensive use of inline `style` attributes is a recurring pattern, characteristic of robust HTML email development to ensure compatibility across diverse email clients.
*   **External Assets:** Dependence on external images hosted on `goskribe.com` and Google Fonts for typography is consistent.
*   **Rapid Iteration Cycle:** The numerous, quick commits highlight an active development phase, iterating on design, layout, and messaging within a single HTML file.
*   **A/B Testing or Refinement:** The shift between "Campaign Insights" and "Free Trial Ending Soon," and then the multiple minor adjustments to the latter, suggest either A/B testing efforts or a detailed refinement process to optimize the email's effectiveness.

## 10:53:04 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\src\pages\Login.jsx` underwent a significant change on 10/17/2025, at 9:58:47 AM. The primary characteristic of this update is that the entire content of the `Login.jsx` file has been commented out.

Based on the commented code, the file previously implemented an Admin Login component with the following functionalities:

*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** The login process was designed in two steps: first, sending an OTP (One-Time Password) via email/password submission, and then verifying the OTP to complete the login.
*   **State Management:** It utilized React's `useState` for managing form data (email, password), OTP digits, validation errors, and a loading state. `useRef` was employed for managing focus on OTP input fields.
*   **Global State Integration:** The component integrated with a Zustand store (`useAdminStore`) to handle authentication logic, including `checkAuth`, `sendOtp`, `verifyOtp`, and `loginAdmin`.
*   **Form Validation:** Client-side validation was implemented for email format, password length, and OTP completion.
*   **User Interface:** The component featured a responsive layout, displaying an image section alongside a login form. It included input fields for email, password, and individual digits for OTP, along with error messages.
*   **Navigation:** Upon successful login, the user was redirected to the `/statistics` page or a previously intended path.

The extensive commenting out of the code suggests a major refactoring, temporary deactivation, or a plan to replace this component with a new implementation, while keeping the old code for reference.

## 11:38:59 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the single file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Diwali\socion1.html`. This file represents an HTML email template for a "Free Trial Ending Soon" notification for a product named "Socion."

**Key Information and File-Specific Updates for `socion1.html`:**

1.  **Initial Design (10/17/2025, 11:07:24 AM):** The email template started with a header featuring a `linear-gradient` background, several decorative CSS-drawn elements (checkmark boxes, colored circles), a custom CSS-drawn "Socion" logo, and a complex CSS-drawn illustration of a woman with a laptop. The footer was minimal, containing only a team signature. The bullet points outlining the money-back guarantee were styled with custom circular `<span>` elements.

2.  **Major Header Redesign and Asset Integration (10/17/2025, 11:07:32 AM):** A significant overhaul of the header occurred.
    *   The `linear-gradient` background and CSS-drawn decorative elements were replaced with a single `background-image` (`socion-new3.png`).
    *   The custom CSS-drawn "Socion" logo was replaced with an `<img>` tag pointing to `socion-logo2.png`.
    *   The intricate CSS-drawn woman-with-laptop illustration was replaced with an `<img>` tag pointing to `socion-new1.png`.
    *   The footer was expanded to include social media icons (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, all linking to `goskribe.com` and using `mailerimages/socion*.png` assets) and a "Powered by: skribe" section.
    *   The font size for the main "YOUR FREE TRIAL'S" text in the trial banner was reduced from `18px` to `16px`.

3.  **Minor Layout and Image Adjustments (10/17/2025, 11:07:37 AM - 11:13:33 AM):**
    *   **11:08:21 AM:** Header content area padding was adjusted from `40px 50px 0 50px;` to `40px 30px 0 40px;`.
    *   **11:09:41 AM:** The header background image was updated from `socion-new3.png` to `bg-header-socion.png`.
    *   **11:10:23 AM:** The header's layout for the trial banner and illustration was restructured, grouping them into a two-column table. The trial banner's line-height was increased from `1.2` to `1.3`.
    *   **11:12:22 AM:** The "YOUR FREE TRIAL'S" text font size was reverted to `18px`, and the "ZERO RISK" text font size was changed to `18x` (a persistent typo `18x` instead of `18px`).
    *   **11:12:35 AM:** The illustration image was updated from `socion-new1.png` to `socion-girl.png`.
    *   **11:13:24 AM:** The header's fixed height was reduced from `430px` to `380px`.
    *   **11:13:33 AM:** The fixed header height was removed entirely, allowing content to dictate height.

4.  **Header Content Experimentation (10/17/2025, 11:27:58 AM - 11:29:09 AM):**
    *   **11:27:58 AM:** The entire trial banner section (including "YOUR FREE TRIAL'S ENDING SOON" and "CONTINUE WITH ZERO RISK") was temporarily commented out/removed, replaced by an empty column.
    *   **11:28:23 AM:** A duplicate of the `socion-girl.png` illustration was added to the empty column, resulting in two identical illustrations side-by-side in the header.
    *   **11:28:42 AM:** The *left* illustration was changed to `offer.png`.
    *   **11:29:09 AM:** The trial banner content was restored to the left column, replacing the `offer.png` illustration and reverting the header to a trial banner/illustration layout.

5.  **Padding and Styling Refinements (10/17/2025, 11:29:29 AM - 11:35:37 AM):**
    *   **11:29:29 AM - 11:30:08 AM:** The `padding` around the main header content area was incrementally adjusted (from `40px 30px 0 30px;` down to `10px 30px 0 30px;`, and then adding `20px` bottom padding to become `10px 30px 20px 30px;`).
    *   **11:30:49 AM:** The trial banner's `background` was changed from a `linear-gradient` to a solid color (`#E86D70`).
    *   **11:31:27 AM:** An incorrect CSS syntax (`background: color: #AC2B0F;;`) was introduced for the trial banner background.
    *   **11:31:40 AM:** This incorrect background syntax was fixed to `background: #E86D70;`, and a `2px solid #FFFFFF` border was added to the trial banner.
    *   **11:34:48 AM:** The main trial banner text (`YOUR FREE TRIAL'S`) font size was mistakenly set to `1px`, effectively hiding it. The "ENDING SOON" text font size was increased from `20px` to `24px`.
    *   **11:34:54 AM:** The `1px` font size for the main trial banner text was corrected to `16px`.
    *   **11:35:02 AM:** The "ENDING SOON" text font size was further increased from `24px` to `26px`.
    *   **11:35:37 AM:** The "ZERO RISK" text font size was increased from `18x` (still containing the typo) to `22px`.

6.  **Final Structural and Content Refinements (10/17/2025, 11:37:26 AM):**
    *   The custom bullet point styling (using absolute positioned `<span>` elements for circles) was removed from the "1-month money-back guarantee" list. The list items now appear without explicit bullet markers, as `list-style: none` remains on the `ul` and no replacement marker is provided.
    *   The `alt` attributes for the social media icons were slightly reordered and standardized (e.g., `alt="facebook"` to `alt="Facebook"`). Notably, the `socionX.png` image is given `alt="LinkedIn"` and `socionLinkedin.png` is given `alt="Twitter/X"`, indicating a potential mismatch between image filename and its corresponding social media platform in the `alt` text.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Single File Focus:** All changes are concentrated on a single HTML file (`socion1.html`), indicating iterative development on one email template.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** Changes occur in quick succession within minutes, suggesting an active debugging or fine-tuning process.
*   **Inline CSS:** The template heavily relies on inline CSS for styling, a common practice for maximum compatibility in email clients.
*   **Header Section Evolution:** The header undergoes the most significant and frequent changes, transitioning from CSS-drawn graphics to external image assets, and then undergoing layout and padding adjustments.
*   **Persistent Content Structure:** The main body of the email, including the greeting, trial ending message, money-back guarantee details (bullet points), CTA, and basic footer, remains largely consistent in its messaging, with styling being the primary variable.
*   **Image Asset Hotlinking:** All images are hotlinked from `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`.
*   **Styling Typos/Errors:** The repeated `font-size: 18x;` typo for the "ZERO RISK" text and the brief introduction of an invalid `background` property indicate minor coding errors during the rapid changes.
*   **Attention to Detail:** Numerous small adjustments to padding, font sizes, and image sources suggest an effort to perfect the visual presentation of the email.

## 12:39:14 PM
The log details iterative development across three HTML email templates (`socion1.html`, `socion2.html`, and `socion3.html`), all timestamped on 10/17/2025. The general purpose of these emails is to notify a user named "Dishant" about a Socion free trial ending and to encourage an upgrade or reactivation with a "1-month money-back guarantee."

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`socion1.html` (11:57:02 AM - 12:09:54 PM):** This file undergoes numerous minor styling and structural adjustments, reflecting a refinement phase for an email template about a trial ending "in a few days."
    *   Initial changes involve micro-adjustments to padding for the "YOUR FREE TRIAL'S ENDING SOON" banner (reducing it from `25px` to `3px`, then expanding to `40px`).
    *   Vertical alignment of the banner content is toggled between `middle` and `top`, eventually settling on `middle`.
    *   The Socion logo's height is reduced from `90px` to `80px`, and its top padding is progressively decreased from `30px` to `10px`.
    *   Text colors in the greeting section are changed from a dark grey (`#2C3E50`) to a dark blue (`#012B5B`), and font weights are increased (`400` to `500` or `600`) for various paragraphs.
    *   The CTA button's vertical padding is reduced, and horizontal padding increased.
    *   The "Team Socion" signature's color is changed to a green (`#34C783`), and its top margin is reduced. The "Powered by: skribe" text color is also adjusted.
    *   Structural refactoring occurs, including moving the "Powered by" footer and reordering the "Team Socion" signature and social icons.
    *   HTML comments are removed, and the `socion-girl.png` illustration is wrapped in an inactive `<a>` tag.

*   **`socion2.html` (12:11:21 PM - 12:22:00 PM):** This file appears to be a copy of the refined `socion1.html`, adapted for a trial that "ends today."
    *   The core message regarding the trial's status is updated to emphasize it "ends today," along with a warning about account inactivity and data loss.
    *   The introductory paragraph about the money-back guarantee is changed to a bolder, darker blue.
    *   A new paragraph is added: "It takes less than a minute to upgrade and keep everything exactly as it is."
    *   The bullet points explaining the money-back guarantee are significantly condensed into a single, comprehensive item that highlights the "risk-free" nature and refund details in green.
    *   The call-to-action in the header banner changes from "CONTINUE WITH ZERO RISK" to "KEEP EVERYTHING RISK FREE."
    *   The primary CTA button text is changed from "Upgrade Now" to "Keep My Access."

*   **`socion3.html` (12:22:17 PM - 12:25:43 PM):** This file is a further adaptation, targeting users whose trial "has officially ended."
    *   The header banner message evolves from "KEEP EVERYTHING RISK FREE" to "REACTIVATE WITH RISK FREE," and then to "REACTIVATE WITH ZERO RISK."
    *   The introductory paragraph is changed to reflect that the trial "has officially ended" and warns about data archiving.
    *   The single bullet point describing the money-back guarantee is rephrased to focus on "reactivating your account" and refining the refund description, initially introducing some redundant text which is then removed.
    *   The final message paragraph is updated to emphasize urgency: "This is your final window to keep your setup alive..."
    *   The CTA button text changes from "Keep My Access" to "Reactivate Now."

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   Most changes occurred in rapid succession, often within seconds or tens of seconds, indicating an active editing session (e.g., 11:57:02 AM to 11:58:56 AM for initial styling tweaks in `socion1.html`).
*   Longer pauses (e.g., 33 seconds for structural rearrangement in `socion1.html` at 12:05:33 PM, or 1 minute 47 seconds for reordering elements at 12:07:20 PM) suggest more substantial thought or testing before committing the change.
*   The creation of `socion2.html` at 12:11:21 PM and `socion3.html` at 12:22:17 PM marks key points where the email campaign's messaging strategy shifted based on trial status.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Design**: The log shows a clear pattern of incremental improvements, starting with styling and layout refinements, then evolving the core messaging to target different stages of a user's free trial (ending soon, ending today, ended).
*   **Consistent Branding**: All versions retain the same visual branding elements (logo, header background, illustration, fonts, and core color palette), indicating a strong adherence to brand guidelines.
*   **Emphasis on "Risk-Free"**: The phrases "ZERO RISK," "RISK FREE," and "1-month money-back guarantee" are central to the messaging and are consistently highlighted, reinforcing a key sales point.
*   **Standard Email Template Structure**: All files use a table-based HTML structure for email compatibility, with extensive inline CSS for styling.
*   **Personalization**: The greeting "Hi Dishant," remains consistent, suggesting these are personalized emails.
*   **Call-to-Action Evolution**: The CTA button text adapts to the trial status, moving from "Upgrade Now" to "Keep My Access" and finally "Reactivate Now."
*   **Social Media and Footer**: The social media links and "Powered by: skribe" footer remain constant across all iterations, providing consistent contact and branding information.

## 12:52:59 PM
The `adminAuth.js` file, updated on October 17, 2025, at 12:46:04 PM, implements an admin authentication middleware. This middleware uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to verify user authorization. It extracts the JWT from `req.cookies.token`, logs it for debugging, and then attempts to verify it using `process.env.JWT_SECRET`. If no token is provided, or if the token is invalid or expired, it responds with a 401 Unauthorized status. Upon successful verification, the decoded user information is attached to `req.user` before proceeding to the next middleware.

## 1:53:26 PM
The changes primarily focus on refining the admin authentication flow, specifically how tokens are managed and transmitted between the frontend (React component and Zustand store) and the backend (via Axios).

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\src\pages\Login.jsx`**
    *   **10/17/2025, 12:54:28 PM**: A comprehensive two-step admin login component was implemented. It features initial email/password validation, followed by an OTP (One-Time Password) sending and verification stage. The component integrates `FaSpinner` for loading feedback and uses `useAdminStore` for authentication logic (`sendOtp`, `verifyOtp`, `loginAdmin`, `checkAuth`). It also includes dynamic input focus for OTP fields and Tailwind CSS for styling. An older, simpler login implementation was found commented out at the end of the file, indicating a significant upgrade to an OTP-based system.
    *   **10/17/2025, 1:02:24 PM** and **10/17/2025, 1:49:20 PM**: In both these instances, the entire content of the `Login.jsx` file was commented out. This suggests either a temporary disabling of the feature for development, testing, or a complete rollback.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\src\store\useAdminStore.js`**
    *   **10/17/2025, 1:25:24 PM**: The Zustand store for admin management (`useAdminStore`) received a major overhaul to include explicit token management. New states (`token`) and actions (`setToken`, `getToken`, `initializeAuth`) were added to handle storing `adminToken` and `adminId` in `localStorage` and the store's state. `loginAdmin`, `checkAuth`, and `adminLogout` methods were updated to interact with this new token management system, ensuring tokens are stored upon successful login and cleared on logout or failed authentication checks.
    *   **10/17/2025, 1:31:28 PM**: The token management was simplified. The explicit `token` state, `setToken`, `getToken`, and `initializeAuth` actions introduced earlier were removed. `loginAdmin` was adjusted to store only a generic "token" (not "adminToken" or "adminId") in `localStorage`, and `adminLogout` was updated to remove this generic "token". This indicates a short-lived attempt to simplify token handling within the store.
    *   **10/17/2025, 1:48:51 PM**: This update refined token handling further. The store no longer directly holds `token` in its state. Instead, it explicitly manages `adminToken` in `localStorage` *and* sets it as a `document.cookie` for authentication. `checkAuth`, `loginAdmin`, `updateUser`, and `adminLogout` were all modified to actively interact with both `localStorage` and `document.cookie` to ensure the token is available as a cookie for backend requests. This change strongly suggests the backend expects authentication tokens via cookies.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\utils\axios.jsx`**
    *   **10/17/2025, 1:31:48 PM**: The Axios instance was configured to use `withCredentials: true`, implying reliance on browser-managed cookies for authentication.
    *   **10/17/2025, 1:32:47 PM**: A significant change was introduced. `withCredentials` was set to `false`, and a request interceptor was added. This interceptor was designed to fetch a 'token' from `localStorage` and include it as an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in all outgoing requests. This represented a shift from cookie-based authentication to header-based (Bearer token) authentication.
    *   **10/17/2025, 1:48:36 PM**: The `axiosInstance` was reverted to its state from 1:31:48 PM. The request interceptor and `withCredentials: false` were removed, and `withCredentials: true` was restored. This rollback aligns with the simultaneous changes in `useAdminStore.js`, indicating a final decision to use cookie-based authentication for backend communication, where the frontend actively manages the cookie.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/17/2025, 12:54:28 PM**: Introduction of the two-step OTP login flow in `Login.jsx`.
*   **10/17/2025, 1:25:24 PM**: Major enhancement to `useAdminStore.js` for explicit `localStorage` and state-based token management.
*   **10/17/2025, 1:32:47 PM**: Critical shift in `axios.jsx` from cookie-based to `Bearer` token header authentication via an interceptor.
*   **10/17/2025, 1:48:36 PM** (for `axios.jsx`) and **1:48:51 PM** (for `useAdminStore.js`): A coordinated change reverting to and reinforcing cookie-based authentication, with the `useAdminStore` manually managing `localStorage` and `document.cookie` for the token.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Authentication as a Central Theme**: All changes across the logs revolve around the admin authentication process, specifically login, OTP verification, and token management.
*   **Evolving Token Management Strategy**: There's a clear iterative process in how authentication tokens are handled. It transitioned from an implicit (cookie-only) approach, to explicit `localStorage` and `Bearer` token headers, and finally settled on a client-managed `localStorage` + `document.cookie` strategy with `withCredentials: true` in Axios. This indicates active debugging and refinement to match backend expectations.
*   **Zustand for State Management**: The `useAdminStore` Zustand store is consistently used to manage authentication-related state (user, loading, error) and business logic.
*   **API Interactions via Axios**: All communication with the backend for authentication, OTP, and user updates occurs through `axiosInstance`.
*   **Code Commenting**: The `Login.jsx` file was completely commented out at multiple points, suggesting active development or temporary disabling of the feature.

## 3:38:30 PM
The log details changes across three HTML email templates: `socion1.html`, `socion2.html`, and `socion3.html`, all located in `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Diwali\`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

All three HTML files are email templates designed for "Socion" to inform users about their "Free Trial Ending Soon." They share a highly consistent structure, styling, and branding:

1.  **Consistent Design:** Each file uses the same overall HTML table-based layout, inline CSS for styling, font families ("Inter", "Source Sans 3"), and image assets (header background, Socion logo, "socion-girl" illustration, and social media icons for Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X/Twitter). The footer consistently mentions "Powered by: skribe".
2.  **Trial Messaging Progression:** While the core message "YOUR FREE TRIAL'S ENDING SOON" remains constant in a prominent banner, the specific urgency and call-to-action text vary slightly across the three files, indicating a possible sequence for different stages of a trial:
    *   `socion1.html`: "Your Socion trial is wrapping up in a few days" with the call to action "CONTINUE WITH ZERO RISK" and button text "Upgrade Now".
    *   `socion2.html`: "Your Socion trial ends today" with the call to action "KEEP EVERYTHING RISK FREE" and button text "Keep My Access".
    *   `socion3.html`: "Your Socion trial has officially ended" with the call to action "REACTIVATE WITH ZERO RISK" and button text "Reactivate Now".
3.  **Money-Back Guarantee:** All three templates heavily feature a "1-month money-back guarantee" as a key incentive for conversion, with similar phrasing about risk-free continuation and full refunds.
4.  **Significant Change Pattern:** The primary modification across all three files is the update of the main call-to-action button's `href` attribute. Initially, all buttons linked to the general `https://socion.in/`. In a synchronized set of changes between 3:24 PM and 3:25 PM, this URL was consistently updated to `https://www.socion.in/signup-pro`, indicating a shift to direct users to a specific professional signup page.
