# Activity Summary for 10/8/2025

## 10:38:44 AM
The provided log details a series of iterative changes to a single file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`. All modifications occurred within a short timeframe on **October 8, 2025, between 10:14:29 AM and 10:16:54 AM**.

The core of these updates revolves around the `timePeriodOptions` array and the initial `timePeriod` state within the `SentimentMain` React component.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **10:14:29 AM:** The initial version of the file was committed. The `timePeriod` state was set to "Last 30 Days", and `timePeriodOptions` included "Last 24 hours", "Last 30 Days", "Last 60 Days", and "Last 90 Days".
*   **10:14:46 AM:** A new option, "Last 1 week" with `categoryId: "7"`, was added to the `timePeriodOptions` array.
*   **10:15:44 AM:** The default `timePeriod` state was changed from "Last 30 Days" to "Last 24 hours".
*   **10:16:12 AM:** The "Last 30 Days" entry in `timePeriodOptions` was renamed to "Last 1 month" (keeping `categoryId: "30"`).
*   **10:16:26 AM:** The "Last 60 Days" entry in `timePeriodOptions` was renamed to "Last 3 month" (keeping `categoryId: "60"`).
*   **10:16:45 AM:** The `categoryId` for "Last 3 month" was temporarily changed to "0". Additionally, "Last 90 Days" was renamed to "Last 6 months" (keeping `categoryId: "90"`).
*   **10:16:54 AM:** The `categoryId` values were further refined and corrected. "Last 3 month" was updated to `categoryId: "90"`, and "Last 6 months" was updated to `categoryId: "180"`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes demonstrate a clear pattern of refining and expanding the time period filtering options available in the UI. This involved:
1.  Adding new time ranges (e.g., "Last 1 week").
2.  Renaming existing time ranges for clarity (e.g., "Last 30 Days" to "Last 1 month").
3.  Adjusting the `categoryId` values to accurately reflect the duration, with an initial slight misstep that was quickly corrected.
4.  A single update to the default selected `timePeriod` value.

Overall, these modifications indicate an effort to improve the user experience for selecting reporting periods within the sentiment analysis section of the application.

## 1:39:36 PM
The provided log details a series of changes made to the `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx` file between 10/8/2025, 12:45:35 PM and 10/8/2025, 1:32:19 PM. The primary focus of these changes is to enhance the "Sentiment" component by introducing dynamic data fetching and display for performance metrics.

Key information and patterns observed:

**File-Specific Updates (`Sentiment.jsx`):**

*   **Initial Setup (12:45:35 PM):** The component starts with several `useState` hooks for managing UI states (media types, competitors, time periods, narrative periods) and static data for dropdown options and initial performance metrics. It imports several constants (`GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_NO_OF_MENTIONS`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`) though not all are used initially.
*   **Import Cleanup (12:46:06 PM):** Unused constants (`GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_NO_OF_MENTIONS`) are removed, streamlining imports to only `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`.
*   **Introduction of Data Fetching Logic (12:47:19 PM - 12:48:25 PM):**
    *   The `useEffect` hook is imported and added.
    *   An `async` function `getSentimentScoreData` is introduced within `useEffect` to handle data fetching.
    *   Basic `try-catch` error handling is implemented for the data fetch.
    *   `userService` is imported, and an incomplete call (`await userService;`) is initially made.
*   **Refactoring Time Period Selection (12:49:08 PM - 12:53:46 PM):**
    *   A new state variable `period` is added to manage the selected time period for data fetching, structured as an object `{ value: string, period: number }`.
    *   A new `periodOptions` array, also with `id`, `value`, `period` structure, is introduced.
    *   The "Performance Metrics" buttons are refactored to use `periodOptions` and update the new `period` state, replacing the previous hardcoded array and `performanceMetricsPeriod` state (which is later removed).
    *   The `DropdownComponent` for time period selection is commented out, indicating a shift towards using the discrete period buttons.
*   **Implementing API Call and State for Fetched Data (12:54:51 PM - 1:19:02 PM):**
    *   A `sentimentScoreData` state variable is added to store the fetched data.
    *   The `userService.post` call is correctly implemented to use `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE` and pass the `period.period` as a query parameter.
    *   The `useEffect` dependency array is updated to `[period]`, ensuring `getSentimentScoreData` runs whenever the selected period changes.
    *   A `setSentimentScoreData({});` call is added at the start of `useEffect` to clear previous data while new data is loading (1:15:10 PM).
    *   The `<h1>` tag for the brand name is updated to dynamically display `sentimentScoreData?.brandName` with a "Loading..." fallback.
    *   The hardcoded `performanceMetrics` display is systematically replaced with dynamic data from `sentimentScoreData`, fetching `score` and `changePercent` for "Sentiment Score", "Positive", "Negative", and "Neutral" metrics.
    *   Conditional styling is applied to the change percentage (`delta`) based on whether it indicates a positive (green text) or negative (red text) change.
    *   "Loading..." fallbacks are added to all dynamic score displays.
    *   HTML tags for scores and deltas are changed from `div` to `p` for better semantic structure.
*   **Re-integrating Old Time Period Dropdown (1:20:37 PM - 1:22:27 PM):**
    *   There was a brief attempt to incorrectly integrate the `period` state with the `DropdownComponent` (1:20:37 PM, 1:21:28 PM), which was then corrected by restoring the original `timePeriod` state and `timePeriodOptions` for the `DropdownComponent`.
    *   The `performanceMetricsPeriod` state variable is briefly reintroduced (1:22:27 PM) but later removed.
*   **Temporary Rollback and Reversion (1:25:23 PM - 1:26:20 PM):** A significant portion of the dynamic data fetching and display logic was reverted (1:25:23 PM), only to be immediately re-introduced in the subsequent change (1:26:20 PM). This suggests an accidental commit or a quick test-and-revert action.
*   **Minor State Variable Management (1:27:46 PM - 1:29:44 PM):** `performanceMetricsPeriod` and `competitor` state variables are commented out and then removed. The `loading` state variable is toggled in its usage with `NarrativeSection`.
*   **Final Structural Adjustments (1:31:20 PM - 1:32:19 PM):** The `React` import is refined to use named imports for `useEffect` and `useState`. `div` elements for displaying performance metrics scores and changes are consistently changed to `p` tags.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/8/2025, 12:46:06 PM:** Initial code cleanup (unused imports).
*   **10/8/2025, 12:47:19 PM:** Introduction of `useEffect` for data fetching.
*   **10/8/2025, 12:48:25 PM:** First attempt at `userService` integration.
*   **10/8/2025, 12:52:37 PM:** Major UI change: performance metrics buttons now control `period` state.
*   **10/8/2025, 12:53:46 PM:** `DropdownComponent` for time period commented out.
*   **10/8/2025, 12:54:51 PM:** `userService` call correctly structured for fetching sentiment data.
*   **10/8/2025, 12:55:20 PM:** `sentimentScoreData` state added, `useEffect` dependency `[period]` added.
*   **10/8/2025, 12:56:40 PM:** `getSentimentScoreData()` called inside `useEffect`.
*   **10/8/2025, 12:57:33 PM:** Cleanup of unused state variables.
*   **10/8/2025, 1:00:44 PM - 1:19:02 PM:** Incremental implementation of dynamic display for performance metrics, including data fetching, "Loading..." states, and conditional styling.
*   **10/8/2025, 1:13:27 PM:** Removal of the static `performanceMetrics` map, fully transitioning to dynamic display.
*   **10/8/2025, 1:15:10 PM:** Added `setSentimentScoreData({});` for better loading UX.
*   **10/8/2025, 1:25:23 PM - 1:26:20 PM:** Temporary large rollback and immediate reversion, indicating a significant change was in progress or was accidentally reverted.
*   **10/8/2025, 1:32:19 PM:** Consistent use of `p` tags for metric display.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development**: Changes show a clear pattern of adding functionality in small, incremental steps. From importing `useEffect` to making a shell API call, then filling in the details, adding state, linking UI elements, and finally rendering dynamic data with error/loading states.
*   **State Management Evolution**: The component's state management evolves significantly, moving from hardcoded values and simple string states to more complex objects for `period` and `sentimentScoreData` to support dynamic content.
*   **UI to Data Binding**: A consistent theme is connecting UI elements (like time period buttons) to state, which in turn triggers data fetching via `useEffect`, and then displaying that fetched data in the UI.
*   **Error and Loading Handling**: Basic mechanisms for `try-catch` and "Loading..." placeholders are introduced for a better user experience when data is being fetched.
*   **Styling Consistency**: The repeated application of conditional `text-green-600` or `text-red-500` classes based on `changePercent` highlights a focus on visual feedback for metric trends.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/8/2025, 5:34:01 PM
    *   **Summary:** This file introduces or updates the `SentimentMain` React component, which serves as a brand sentiment dashboard. Key functionalities include:
        *   **Dynamic Data Fetching:** It fetches brand sentiment scores from the backend (`GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE` endpoint) based on a selected time `period` (e.g., last 1, 3, or 6 months).
        *   **Performance Metrics Display:** Presents a detailed breakdown of sentiment scores (overall, positive, negative, neutral) with current percentages and their change from a previous period, highlighted with green for positive and red for negative shifts.
        *   **Interactive Filtering:** Incorporates multiple filtering options for users, including:
            *   `MultiSelectDropdown` for various media types (National, Regional, Blogs, Online, etc.).
            *   `DropdownComponent` for time periods (Last 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, etc.).
            *   Date range input fields.
            *   `MultiSelectDropdown` to select competitors for narrative comparison.
        *   **Narrative Section:** Includes dynamic content for "Company Narratives" and "Competitor Narratives," suggesting a feature to analyze textual sentiment.
        *   **UI Components:** Utilizes several reusable UI components like `BrandHeader`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`, `SentimentBarChart`, and `NarrativeSection`.
        *   The component uses `useState` for managing various states like loading status, selected filters, and fetched data, and `useEffect` for data fetching on component mount or `period` change.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/8/2025, 5:36:51 PM
    *   **Summary:** This file serves as a comprehensive central repository for defining a vast array of API endpoints used throughout the application.
        *   **Environment Variable Integration:** Heavily relies on `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_URL_V1`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATTACHMENT_URL`) to construct base URLs, promoting configurable and environment-aware API calls.
        *   **Extensive API Endpoints:** Defines endpoints across numerous categories, reflecting a wide range of application features, including:
            *   **Authentication & User Management:** Login, signup, OTP generation, token resolution, password reset, user info.
            *   **CRM & Journalists:** Retrieving CRM data, adding/deleting journalists from lists, journalist portfolios, and suggestions.
            *   **Reporting & Analytics:** APIs for dashboards, beatwatch, reports (brand, influencer, spokesperson, topic), Geo statistics, and brand dashboard metrics (language, sentiment, share of voice, media count).
            *   **Campaign Management:** Creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of campaigns and lists; handling attachments, email quotas, and tracking.
            *   **Brand Tracking:** Adding/deactivating brands, spokespersons, and keywords.
            *   **Social Media Integrations:** Endpoints for Instagram and Twitter data, including filters.
            *   **Miscellaneous:** Career openings, podcast data, pre-login contact forms, and various filtering options (media type, beat, topic, competitor).
        *   **Static Constants:** Includes `STATICCOUNT` (1000) for selection purposes and `Freebies` string.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **API-Centric Development:** Both files underscore a strong reliance on API interactions. `Sentiment.jsx` consumes an API endpoint, while `constants.js` defines the comprehensive set of available endpoints.
*   **Modular Component Design:** `Sentiment.jsx` utilizes a component-based approach with imports of various UI components and services, common in React applications.
*   **Data-Driven Dashboards:** The sentiment component specifically highlights a focus on displaying and filtering analytical data related to brand performance.
*   **Filtering and User Interaction:** There's a recurring theme of providing extensive filtering capabilities (by media type, time, competitor, beat, etc.) to allow users to refine displayed information.
*   **Environment Configuration:** The `constants.js` file demonstrates a consistent pattern of constructing API URLs using environment variables, ensuring flexibility and security in deployment.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** The close timestamps indicate that these changes were likely part of a single development sprint or feature implementation, potentially related to enhancing the "Brand Sentiment" section and supporting its API needs.
*   **Brand-Related Features:** There's a clear emphasis on "Brand" related functionalities, both in the `Sentiment.jsx` component's purpose and the numerous `BrandDashboard` and `BrandTracking` APIs defined in `constants.js`.
