# Activity Summary for 10/8/2025

## 10:38:44 AM
The provided log details a series of iterative changes to a single file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx`. All modifications occurred within a short timeframe on **October 8, 2025, between 10:14:29 AM and 10:16:54 AM**.

The core of these updates revolves around the `timePeriodOptions` array and the initial `timePeriod` state within the `SentimentMain` React component.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **10:14:29 AM:** The initial version of the file was committed. The `timePeriod` state was set to "Last 30 Days", and `timePeriodOptions` included "Last 24 hours", "Last 30 Days", "Last 60 Days", and "Last 90 Days".
*   **10:14:46 AM:** A new option, "Last 1 week" with `categoryId: "7"`, was added to the `timePeriodOptions` array.
*   **10:15:44 AM:** The default `timePeriod` state was changed from "Last 30 Days" to "Last 24 hours".
*   **10:16:12 AM:** The "Last 30 Days" entry in `timePeriodOptions` was renamed to "Last 1 month" (keeping `categoryId: "30"`).
*   **10:16:26 AM:** The "Last 60 Days" entry in `timePeriodOptions` was renamed to "Last 3 month" (keeping `categoryId: "60"`).
*   **10:16:45 AM:** The `categoryId` for "Last 3 month" was temporarily changed to "0". Additionally, "Last 90 Days" was renamed to "Last 6 months" (keeping `categoryId: "90"`).
*   **10:16:54 AM:** The `categoryId` values were further refined and corrected. "Last 3 month" was updated to `categoryId: "90"`, and "Last 6 months" was updated to `categoryId: "180"`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes demonstrate a clear pattern of refining and expanding the time period filtering options available in the UI. This involved:
1.  Adding new time ranges (e.g., "Last 1 week").
2.  Renaming existing time ranges for clarity (e.g., "Last 30 Days" to "Last 1 month").
3.  Adjusting the `categoryId` values to accurately reflect the duration, with an initial slight misstep that was quickly corrected.
4.  A single update to the default selected `timePeriod` value.

Overall, these modifications indicate an effort to improve the user experience for selecting reporting periods within the sentiment analysis section of the application.
