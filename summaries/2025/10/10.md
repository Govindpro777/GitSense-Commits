# Activity Summary for 10/10/2025

## 11:58:39 AM
The log primarily details the evolution of API endpoint definitions and the implementation of two React components related to brand analytics: `ShareofVoice.jsx` and `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/10/2025, 11:15:26 AM and 11:15:59 AM
    *   This file serves as a central repository for API endpoints and base URLs, many of which are derived from environment variables (e.g., `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_URL_V1`).
    *   It defines a wide array of URLs for authentication, user management, reporting, campaign management, CRM, search, social media integrations, and various dashboard metrics.
    *   A significant addition during this period is the import of `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` (Timestamp: 11:36:46 AM), indicating the introduction of a new API for share of voice data.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Initial State (11:19:15 AM):** The component starts as a static layout for a "Brand Dashboard" section, importing UI components like `BrandHeader`, `MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, `TopJournalists`, `DropdownComponent`, and `MultiSelectDropdown`. It initializes basic state for `lastDays` and `selectedMediaTypes`, and includes dummy data for journalists.
    *   **Introduction of Data Fetching (11:21:34 AM - 11:36:46 AM):**
        *   An `useEffect` hook is added to fetch data, initially with an incomplete API call.
        *   `userService` is introduced for making API requests (11:22:42 AM).
        *   The `getTopJournalist` async function is developed to fetch data using `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS`. The `payload` for this call is gradually introduced, commented out, then re-added and refined to include `startDate`, `endDate`, `filterCompetitors`, and `media` (11:33:57 AM, then corrected at 11:51:18 AM).
        *   State variables `startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`, `timePeriod` are introduced, along with `handleDateRangeChange` and `handleEndDateChange` functions, to manage date selections for filtering (11:28:11 AM - 11:30:21 AM).
        *   The date input fields in the UI are uncommented and bound to these state variables.
        *   New states `selectedCompetitors`, `shareOfVoiceData`, `competitors` are added for the Share of Voice feature (11:39:14 AM).
        *   A second `useEffect` hook is added to fetch `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` data, depending on `selectedMediaTypes` and `selectedCompetitors` (11:39:14 AM).
    *   **Refinement of State Management (11:46:03 AM - 11:55:58 AM):**
        *   The `ShareofVoice` component takes on the responsibility of managing filter states (`selectedMediaTypes`, `selectedCompetitors`) and passing them, along with their setters, down to its child `MonthShareOfVoice`.
        *   A temporary duplication of `selectedMediaTypes` state occurs, quickly resolved (11:49:20 AM - 11:51:18 AM).
        *   A new state `selectedMediaTypes2` is introduced to allow separate media type filtering for the `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS` API call, distinguishing it from the `selectedMediaTypes` used for `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` (11:53:15 AM - 11:55:58 AM).

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11:39:43 AM):** This component is first logged, responsible for rendering a bar chart using `react-apexcharts`. It defines its own `selectedMediaTypes`, `selectedCompetitors`, `shareOfVoiceData`, and `competitors` states. It also includes an `useEffect` for fetching `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` data, mirroring the parent.
    *   **Refactoring for Parent-Child Communication (11:39:59 AM - 11:49:32 AM):**
        *   The component undergoes several iterations of commenting out and re-introducing its local state and data fetching `useEffect`.
        *   Ultimately, it is refactored to receive `shareOfVoiceData`, `mediaTypeOptions`, `competitorOptions`, `selectedCompetitors`, `setSelectedCompetitors`, `selectedMediaTypes`, and `setSelectedMediaTypes` as props (11:47:07 AM - 11:49:32 AM). This centralizes state management in the parent `ShareofVoice.jsx` component.
        *   It includes logic `transformDataForChart` to format `shareOfVoiceData` for the chart.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/10/2025, 11:19:15 AM:** Initial creation of `ShareofVoice.jsx` with static layout.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:21:34 AM:** First `useEffect` added to `ShareofVoice.jsx` for data fetching.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:22:42 AM:** `userService` imported and used for API calls.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:28:11 AM:** Introduction of date range state and handlers in `ShareofVoice.jsx`.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:36:46 AM:** `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` constant imported, signifying a new API integration.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:39:14 AM:** New `useEffect` for `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` and related states added to `ShareofVoice.jsx`.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:39:43 AM:** `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` component is first introduced.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:44:51 AM - 11:45:20 AM:** `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` is refactored to remove its own data fetching logic and rely on props.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:51:18 AM:** `payload` for `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS` is fully implemented in `ShareofVoice.jsx`.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:53:15 AM - 11:55:58 AM:** Introduction of `selectedMediaTypes2` in `ShareofVoice.jsx` to differentiate media type filters for different API calls.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development:** Changes often appear in rapid succession (e.g., within seconds or minutes), indicating an incremental development process where features are built up step-by-step, often with minor syntax fixes or completion of statements in subsequent commits.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The use of `ShareofVoice.jsx` as a parent orchestrating data fetching and passing data/setters to child components like `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` demonstrates a React component hierarchy.
*   **State Management with Hooks:** Heavy reliance on `useState` for managing component-specific data (e.g., `selectedMediaTypes`, `startDate`) and `useEffect` for handling side effects like data fetching.
*   **API Integration:** Consistent use of a `userService` and predefined constants from `constants.js` for interacting with backend APIs via `userService.post`.
*   **Data Transformation:** The `transformDataForChart` function in `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` indicates a pattern of adapting raw API response data into a format suitable for visualization libraries.
*   **Filtering and User Interaction:** The presence of `MultiSelectDropdown` components and date input fields suggests an emphasis on user-driven data filtering and dynamic content display.
*   **Refactoring for Responsibility:** An initial tendency to duplicate data fetching logic in both parent and child components (`ShareofVoice.jsx` and `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` both attempting to fetch `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` data) is observed, followed by a refactoring where the parent takes over data fetching and passes necessary data and update functions as props to the child.

## 12:58:26 PM
The provided log details significant development activity within the `skribefrontend` application, primarily focusing on the "Brand Dashboard" features related to "Share of Voice" and "Top Journalists."

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial State (10/10/2025, 12:00:18 PM to 12:33:13 PM)**: The component was entirely commented out, suggesting it was either under development, undergoing a major overhaul, or temporarily disabled.
    *   **Activation and Core Functionality (10/10/2025, 12:38:04 PM)**: This timestamp marks a pivotal change where the entire component was uncommented and made fully functional. This involved:
        *   Enabling all necessary React imports (`useEffect`, `useState`) and component imports (`BrandHeader`, `MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, `TopJournalists`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`).
        *   Integrating custom hooks (`useBrandMediaTypes`) and API services (`userService`).
        *   Defining state variables for managing time periods (`timePeriod`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`), journalist data (`topJournalistsData`, `topCompetitorJournalistsData`), share of voice data (`shareOfVoiceData`), competitor information (`selectedCompetitors`, `competitors`), and media types (`selectedMediaTypes`, `selectedMediaTypes2`).
        *   Implementing `useEffect` hooks for data fetching, including `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE`, `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS`, and a newly introduced `GET_TOP_COMETITOR_JOURNALIST` (though its definition is not in the `constants.js` entries provided in the log, its usage here is explicit).
        *   Adding comprehensive date range calculation logic (`calculateDateRange`) and event handlers for date inputs, including validation to prevent illogical date selections (e.g., end date before start date).
        *   The component's JSX structure was fully enabled, rendering various sub-components to build the "Brand Dashboard."
    *   **Minor Refinement (10/10/2025, 12:38:41 PM)**: Removal of `console.log` statements for API payloads, indicating a cleanup of development logs.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\TopJournalists.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial Development & Data Transformation (10/10/2025, 12:13:03 PM)**: The component was uncommented and refactored from using mock data to receiving `topJournalistsData` and `topCompetitorJournalistsData` via props. A `transformJournalistData` helper was introduced to map raw API responses (`intjid`, `vchauthor`, `count`) to a more structured format (`id`, `name`, `outlet`, `mentions`) for display. Basic "Add To CRM" and "Create List" buttons were enabled.
    *   **UI/UX Enhancements and Loading States (10/10/2025, 12:19:36 PM)**:
        *   An `isLoading` prop was added to display visual feedback ("Loading journalists data...", "Loading competitors data...") during data fetching.
        *   The display was updated to show the count of "found" journalists.
        *   "Add To CRM" and "Create List" buttons were conditionally disabled if no competition journalists were found.
        *   Error handling for broken profile images was implemented (`onError`).
        *   A `formatName` utility was added to capitalize journalist names consistently.
        *   The empty state message for the `JournalistTable` was improved to include suggestions like "Try adjusting your filters or date range."
    *   **Refinement of Empty State Display (10/10/2025, 12:24:53 PM to 12:29:20 PM)**: Several small iterations focused on correctly displaying "No Records Found" within the `JournalistTable` when `journalists` array is empty, moving from direct `<tbody>` text to a structured table row with `colSpan` and adjusting vertical padding (`py-30`).
    *   **CRM Integration & State Management (10/10/2025, 12:45:09 PM to 12:49:35 PM)**:
        *   A function `addToCRM` was introduced to handle adding selected journalists to a CRM system. This involved importing `useNotification` for user feedback and `PRECRM_POSTDATA` from `constants.js` for the API call. It included validation (e.g., max 5 journalists at a time) and notifications for success or hitting CRM limits.
        *   A significant re-architecture occurred at **10/10/2025, 12:48:27 PM**, where `useState` hooks for `selectedJournalistsId` and `competitionData` were explicitly added to `TopJournalists.jsx`. A `handleSelect` function was introduced for managing checkbox selections, and `JournalistTable` was updated to accept `selectedJournalistsId`, `handleSelect`, and `showCheckbox` props for granular control.
        *   However, the very next change at **10/10/2025, 12:49:35 PM** appears to be a partial revert of this precise state management, removing the `useState` hooks for `selectedJournalistsId` and `competitionData` from `TopJournalists`, which would likely break the `addToCRM` functionality as it relies on these states.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**:
    *   **API Endpoint Definitions (10/10/2025, 12:04:02 PM and 12:04:54 PM)**: This file consistently defines numerous API endpoints and static constants. The content remained identical across the two timestamps provided. These constants are crucial for the application's backend communication, covering authentication, user preferences, reports, campaigns, CRM, and various dashboard metrics (brand, influencer, spokesperson, topic, geo, etc.).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/10/2025, 12:38:04 PM**: `ShareofVoice.jsx` transitions from a commented-out placeholder to a fully operational component, integrating various sub-components and data fetching logic.
*   **10/10/2025, 12:13:03 PM**: `TopJournalists.jsx` is initially activated and refactored to work with dynamic data.
*   **10/10/2025, 12:19:36 PM**: `TopJournalists.jsx` receives substantial UI/UX improvements, including loading indicators and better handling of empty states.
*   **10/10/2025, 12:48:27 PM**: `TopJournalists.jsx` integrates CRM functionality with explicit state management, though this change appears to be partially reverted immediately after.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Component Design**: The `ShareofVoice` component acts as a parent, orchestrating data flow and rendering several child components like `MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, and `TopJournalists`.
*   **API-driven Data Flow**: Both `ShareofVoice` and `TopJournalists` heavily rely on fetching data from a backend API using a `userService` and processing the responses. A common pattern is checking for `res?.response?.status === "Ok"`.
*   **Date Range Filtering**: A consistent pattern of allowing users to select predefined or custom date ranges to filter displayed data across dashboard sections.
*   **User Feedback**: Implementation of `useNotification` for displaying success, warning, and error messages to the user.
*   **Environment Variable Configuration**: The `constants.js` file demonstrates a strong pattern of defining API base URLs and other configurable values using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables, ensuring easy configuration for different deployment environments.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: The multiple small changes to `TopJournalists.jsx`, especially concerning empty state rendering and CRM integration logic, indicate an iterative development process. The temporary commenting out of entire components also points to this.

## 1:58:11 PM
The following details summarize the code changes for the file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\TopJournalists.jsx`.

**Summary of Key Changes:**

**10/10/2025, 1:06:10 PM:**
*   **Component Activation and State Management:** The `TopJournalists` component transitions from a fully commented-out state to an active, functional component. It introduces `useState` hooks to manage `selectedJournalistsId` (an array of journalist IDs) and `selectedJournalists` (an array of journalist objects).
*   **Interactive Selection:** A `handleSelect` function is added to facilitate toggling journalist selection, updating the `selectedJournalistsId` and `selectedJournalists` states.
*   **CRM Integration Refinement:** The "Add To CRM" button for "Competition" journalists is enhanced to:
    *   Display the count of currently selected journalists (e.g., "Add To CRM (3)").
    *   Implement more robust disabling logic, becoming disabled if no journalists are selected or if the `competitionJournalists` array is empty.
    *   Add specific TailwindCSS classes (`disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed`) for visual feedback when disabled.
*   **JournalistTable Enhancements:** The `JournalistTable` component is refactored to accept new props (`handleSelect`, `selectedJournalistsId`, `showCheckboxes`). Checkboxes within the table are made interactive and their `checked` state is now controlled by `selectedJournalistsId`, allowing users to select journalists.

**10/10/2025, 1:06:48 PM:**
*   **Partial Reversion:** This entry largely reverts the significant changes made at 1:06:10 PM.
    *   The `useState` declarations for journalist selection and the `handleSelect` function are removed.
    *   The "Add To CRM" button's advanced disabling logic and selected count display are removed, reverting to a simpler disabled state based solely on `competitionJournalists.length`.
    *   An older `setData` call (likely meant to update parent component state) is reintroduced within the `addToCRM` function, which was absent in the prior active version.
    *   The `JournalistTable` component calls no longer pass the selection-related props, and the checkboxes inside `JournalistTable` are no longer programmatically controlled.

**10/10/2025, 1:08:07 PM:**
*   **Re-application of Selection Logic:** The code re-applies the journalist selection and CRM integration enhancements from 1:06:10 PM.
    *   `useState` hooks for `selectedJournalistsId` and `selectedJournalists` and the `handleSelect` function are reinstated.
    *   The `setData` call within `addToCRM` is removed again.
    *   The "Add To CRM" button's selected count and advanced disabling logic are re-implemented.
    *   `JournalistTable` component calls for both "Brand" and "Competition" are updated to pass `handleSelect`, `selectedJournalistsId`, and explicitly use `showCheckboxes` prop (`false` for Brand, `true` for Competition).

**10/10/2025, 1:10:49 PM:**
*   **Temporary UI Restructuring:** The "Add To CRM" and "Create List" buttons, including their dynamic count and disabling logic, are moved from the "Competition" journalists section to the "Brand" journalists section. This change appears to be incomplete or a misplacement, as it leaves the competition section without action buttons in the provided diff.

**10/10/2025, 1:11:48 PM:**
*   **UI Restructuring Reversion:** The action buttons ("Add To CRM", "Create List") are moved back to the "Competition" journalists section, reverting the change made at 1:10:49 PM. The `JournalistTable` calls continue to pass selection-related props.

**10/10/2025, 1:13:34 PM:**
*   **Minor/No Functional Change:** This log entry shows no discernible functional changes compared to the previous timestamp, likely indicating a minor non-code change like whitespace or a repeated save operation.

**10/10/2025, 1:17:24 PM:**
*   **Text Simplification:** The descriptive text accompanying the "Top Journalists (Brand)" and "Top Journalists (Competition)" headings is simplified. The dynamic count of journalists (e.g., `({X found})`) is removed from the paragraph text, leaving only the general description.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development and Reversions:** There is a clear pattern of features (like journalist selection and CRM button logic) being introduced, then partially or fully reverted, and subsequently re-applied. This suggests an active development phase with experimentation or corrections.
*   **Journalist Selection Core Feature:** The implementation and refinement of selecting journalists (using `selectedJournalistsId` and `handleSelect`) and integrating this with the "Add To CRM" functionality is a consistent focus.
*   **CRM Integration:** The logic for adding journalists to CRM, including validation for selection limits (1-5 journalists at a time) and a global CRM limit (50 journalists), along with success/warning notifications, remains a central part of the `addToCRM` function throughout the changes.
*   **Error/Success Notifications:** The `useNotification` hook is consistently used to provide user feedback for CRM operations.
*   **Component Structure:** The component consistently maintains a two-column layout for displaying brand and competition journalists, each utilizing a `JournalistTable` sub-component.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** All logged changes occurred within a short time frame (approximately 11 minutes) on the same day, indicating rapid development or debugging activities.

## 2:58:05 PM
The provided log details code changes primarily within two JavaScript/React components: `ShareofVoice.jsx` and `TopJournalists.jsx`, both located in the `src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice` directory. All changes occurred on **10/10/2025** between 2:00:00 PM and 2:56:29 PM, indicating a focused development or debugging session.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp of Significant Change:** 10/10/2025, 2:01:13 PM
    *   **Key Updates:** The component was modified to integrate a custom notification system. The `useNotification` hook from `@/components/ErrorAlert/ErrorContextNotification` was imported and utilized. Specifically, a native browser `alert` for date validation in the `handleEndDateChange` function ("End date cannot be earlier than start date.") was replaced with a call to `showNotification("End date cannot be earlier than start date.", "warning")`. This shifts UI feedback from intrusive pop-ups to a more integrated notification system.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\TopJournalists.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp of Significant Changes:**
        *   10/10/2025, 2:35:34 PM: Introduced `buildCampPopup` call for "Create List" button.
        *   10/10/2025, 2:38:13 PM - 2:39:32 PM: `BuildCampaign` component integration.
        *   10/10/2025, 2:41:40 PM: `BuildCampaign` component repositioning.
        *   10/10/2025, 2:42:17 PM - 2:43:45 PM: Prop refinement for `BuildCampaign`.
    *   **Key Updates:** This component underwent more extensive modifications, primarily focused on enhancing the "Create List" functionality:
        *   The "Create List" button's `onClick` handler was updated to call a new `buildCampPopup` function.
        *   A `buildCampPopup` function was added to validate journalist selections and manage the opening of a modal. It leverages `showNotification` for user feedback if no journalists are selected.
        *   A new `BuildCampaign` component (imported from `@/components/Campaign/BuildCampaign`) was integrated. This required declaring an `isOpen` state variable to control its visibility.
        *   Initially, the `BuildCampaign` component was incorrectly placed within the `JournalistTable` sub-component, but was later moved to the main `TopJournalists` component to correctly utilize its state.
        *   The `BuildCampaign` component's props were refined, including setting `selectAllLabel={"Select All"}` and passing `selectedJournalistsId` (instead of `selectedJournalists`) as the list of selected journalists.
        *   There was a recurring pattern of commenting out and re-enabling the `disabled` attribute and the conditional display of the selected journalist count for the "Add To CRM" button, suggesting active UI testing or refinement of interaction logic. The final state at 2:56:29 PM shows these elements re-enabled.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent Notification Integration:** Both files show a clear pattern of integrating and utilizing a `useNotification` hook for providing user feedback, moving away from standard browser alerts.
*   **State Management for UI Elements:** The `TopJournalists.jsx` component demonstrates recurring patterns of managing UI state (e.g., `isOpen` for modals, `selectedJournalistsId` for selections) to enable dynamic interactions.
*   **Iterative Development:** The multiple, rapid changes to `TopJournalists.jsx` indicate an iterative development process, with additions like the `BuildCampaign` component being refined through several commits (e.g., correcting import paths, defining state, repositioning rendering, refining props).
*   **UI Fine-tuning/Debugging:** The repeated toggling of button `disabled` states and text displays in `TopJournalists.jsx` suggests detailed attention to user interaction and possibly debugging UI behavior during selection processes.

## 3:58:09 PM
The changes exclusively affect the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\TopJournalists.jsx`, which contains a React component for displaying and managing lists of top journalists related to a brand and its competition. The component allows users to select journalists, add them to a CRM, or create a media list (campaign).

**File-Specific Updates:**

The primary focus of the changes throughout the log is on the behavior and UI of the "Add To CRM" and "Create List" buttons within the `TopJournalists` component.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:02:42 PM:** The initial state includes both "Add To CRM" and "Create List" buttons.
    *   "Add To CRM" is disabled if `competitionJournalists` is empty OR no journalists are `selectedJournalistsId`. It also conditionally displays the count of `selectedJournalistsId`.
    *   "Create List" is disabled if `competitionJournalists` is empty.
    *   There are commented-out blocks of similar button structures, suggesting alternative UI implementations.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:03:25 PM:** The active button group for "Add To CRM" and "Create List" is changed.
    *   The "Add To CRM" button becomes unconditionally enabled (its `disabled` prop is removed) and no longer displays the count of selected journalists.
    *   The `disabled` prop for the "Create List" button (`disabled={competitionJournalists.length === 0}`) is commented out, effectively enabling it at all times.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:10:52 PM:** The changes from 3:03:25 PM are reverted.
    *   The original "Add To CRM" button, with its `disabled` logic (`competitionJournalists.length === 0 || selectedJournalistsId.length === 0`) and selected journalist count display, is restored.
    *   The "Create List" button also reverts to its `disabled={competitionJournalists.length === 0}` state.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:12:02 PM:** Further modification to the "Add To CRM" button's `disabled` prop.
    *   The condition `competitionJournalists.length === 0 ||` is commented out, meaning the button is now only disabled if `selectedJournalistsId.length === 0`.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:12:19 PM:** The `disabled` prop for "Add To CRM" is further simplified.
    *   The commented-out `competitionJournalists.length === 0 ||` part is removed, making the condition `disabled={selectedJournalistsId.length === 0}`.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:12:31 PM:** A partial revert.
    *   The `disabled` prop for "Add To CRM" reverts to commenting out `competitionJournalists.length === 0 ||`, similar to the state at 3:12:02 PM.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:12:44 PM:** A full revert of the "Add To CRM" `disabled` prop.
    *   The `disabled` prop is fully restored to its state at 3:10:52 PM: `disabled={ competitionJournalists.length === 0 || selectedJournalistsId.length === 0 }`.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:15:06 PM:** Code cleanup.
    *   The previously commented-out blocks of redundant button UI code are entirely removed from the JSX. Functionally, the component remains the same as 3:12:44 PM.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:18:22 PM:** An accidental, large-scale commenting out of the component's code occurs, followed by an incomplete re-paste of the same code below the comments. This would have caused a functional breakage if deployed.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:20:35 PM:** Correction of the previous accidental change.
    *   The large commented-out block is removed, and the file content is restored to the functional state it was in at 3:15:06 PM.

*   **10/10/2025, 3:25:00 PM:** Another significant modification to the button UI.
    *   The `disabled` prop for the "Add To CRM" button is completely commented out (`// disabled={ ... }`), making the button always enabled.
    *   The conditional display of `(${selectedJournalistsId.length})` in the "Add To CRM" button's text is also commented out.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The period between 3:02:42 PM and 3:25:00 PM on 10/10/2025 saw rapid iterations on the `TopJournalists.jsx` file. The most significant periods of change are:

*   **3:03:25 PM to 3:12:44 PM:** A series of highly concentrated updates, additions, and reverts, particularly impacting the `disabled` logic of the "Add To CRM" button. This indicates active experimentation or debugging of button enablement conditions.
*   **3:18:22 PM:** An accidental, likely temporary, corruption of the file content with extensive commenting and partial re-pasting.
*   **3:20:35 PM:** Immediate resolution of the accidental corruption.
*   **3:25:00 PM:** A final, functional change disabling the `disabled` logic and journalist count display for the "Add To CRM" button.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Button Logic Iterations:** The most prominent pattern is the repeated modification, reversion, and re-modification of the `disabled` property and text content of the "Add To CRM" button. This suggests an ongoing design or functional decision-making process regarding when users should be allowed to add journalists to the CRM and how this action is represented in the UI.
*   **Code Cleanup/Comment Management:** There's a pattern of using comments to temporarily disable code blocks (e.g., button logic, UI variants) and later removing them, indicating a development process that involves testing alternative implementations or cleaning up old code.
*   **Single File Focus:** All changes are isolated to a single React component file, indicating focused development on this specific feature or UI section.
*   **Accidental Edits:** The large, commented-out block and subsequent incomplete re-paste at 3:18 PM followed by a quick revert at 3:20 PM highlights the natural occurrence of development errors and immediate corrections.

## 5:57:48 PM
The `constants.js` file, located at `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`, was logged twice in quick succession on October 10, 2025, at 5:26:40 PM and 5:26:54 PM. Despite the two entries, the code content remained identical across both timestamps, indicating no functional changes were made to the file during this period.

The file itself serves as a central repository for API endpoints and other constant values within the `skribefrontend` application. Key patterns and elements observed in its content include:

*   **Environment Variable Usage:** Many base URLs and sensitive paths (`Url_V1`, `url`, `ATTACH_URL`, `CHAI_TIME`, `RESETPASS`, `SOCIALURL`) are dynamically pulled from `process.env` (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_URL_V1`), promoting configurable deployments.
*   **API Endpoint Categorization:** The constants are logically grouped by functionality, such as:
    *   **Authentication & User Management:** `LOGINAPI`, `BEFORE_SIGNUP`, `GENERATEOTP`, `RESETPASSWORD`, `USERINFO`, `REFRESHTOKEN_API`, `logout_API`.
    *   **Image/Attachment URLs:** `baseURL`, `OUTLETPATH`, `SUPPTIMAGE`, `CHAIIMG` derived from `ATTACH_URL` and `url`.
    *   **Reporting & Analytics:** `REPORTSAPI`, `brandAPI`, `trendingInfluencer`, `trendingSpokesperson`, `trendingTopic`, `HEADERAPI`, `GEOSTATS`, `BRANDLANGUAGE`, `BRANDSENTIMENT`, `SHAREVOICE`.
    *   **User Preferences/Settings:** `USERPREFERENCES`, `ALLGEO`, `GETMEDIATYPE`, `GETALLBEATS`, `GETALLCOMPETITORS`, `GETALLTOPICS`, `GETALLBRANDS`, `GETALLSPOKES`.
    *   **Campaigns & Email:** `CREATELIST`, `GETCAMPAIGNLIST`, `LISTSENDMAIL`, `GETEMAILQUOTA`, `CREATE_CAMPAIGN`, `SAVE_ATTACHMENTS`, `CAMPAIGN_SEND_MAIL`.
    *   **CRM (Customer Relationship Management):** `CRMAPI`, `DELCRMRECORD`, `PRECRM_POSTDATA`.
    *   **Journalist & SmartProfile Data:** `journalist_API`, `JOURNALISTPORTFOLIO`, `JOURNALISTPORTFOLIOBYID`, `JOURNALISTSPOKESPERSON`, `JOURNALISTTOPICS`, `JOURNALISTBRAND`.
    *   **Search & Filtering:** `JOURNOBYFILTER`, `ADVANCESEARCH`, `GETALLJOURNO`, `GETALLJOURNO_REGIONAL`.
    *   **Content Sections:** `BEATFULLARTICLE`, `SKRIBEEXTRA`, `PODCASTHOME`, `instagram`, `twitter`.
    *   **Brand & Competitor Tracking:** `ADD_BRAND`, `ADD_SPOKESPERSON`, `BRANDTRACKER`, `ADDCOMPETITOR`.
    *   **Media List Management:** `MEDIA_LIST`, `LIST_DETAILS`, `ADD_JOURNO_MEDIA_LIST`, `SHARED_LIST`.
*   **Consistent Naming Convention:** Most API endpoint constants follow an uppercase snake_case or PascalCase pattern (e.g., `LOGINAPI`, `Url_V1`, `GETALLBEATS`).
*   **URL Structure:** Nearly all API endpoints are constructed by concatenating `Url_V1` with specific paths, indicating a consistent API versioning and base URL strategy (`/v1/`).
*   **Descriptive Comments:** Comments are used to group related constants and provide brief descriptions of their purpose (e.g., `// REPORTS API CALL`, `// CAMPAIGN API (LIST API)`, `// SMARTPROFILE`).
*   **Placeholder/Default Values:** A `STATICCOUNT` of `1000` is defined for a "select all button," suggesting a practical limit or default for bulk operations.

Overall, the `constants.js` file is crucial for managing the application's external communication, centralizing all API endpoints and key configuration values in one easily manageable location, leveraging environment variables for flexibility.
