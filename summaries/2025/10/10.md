# Activity Summary for 10/10/2025

## 11:58:39 AM
The log primarily details the evolution of API endpoint definitions and the implementation of two React components related to brand analytics: `ShareofVoice.jsx` and `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/10/2025, 11:15:26 AM and 11:15:59 AM
    *   This file serves as a central repository for API endpoints and base URLs, many of which are derived from environment variables (e.g., `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_URL_V1`).
    *   It defines a wide array of URLs for authentication, user management, reporting, campaign management, CRM, search, social media integrations, and various dashboard metrics.
    *   A significant addition during this period is the import of `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` (Timestamp: 11:36:46 AM), indicating the introduction of a new API for share of voice data.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Initial State (11:19:15 AM):** The component starts as a static layout for a "Brand Dashboard" section, importing UI components like `BrandHeader`, `MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, `TopJournalists`, `DropdownComponent`, and `MultiSelectDropdown`. It initializes basic state for `lastDays` and `selectedMediaTypes`, and includes dummy data for journalists.
    *   **Introduction of Data Fetching (11:21:34 AM - 11:36:46 AM):**
        *   An `useEffect` hook is added to fetch data, initially with an incomplete API call.
        *   `userService` is introduced for making API requests (11:22:42 AM).
        *   The `getTopJournalist` async function is developed to fetch data using `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS`. The `payload` for this call is gradually introduced, commented out, then re-added and refined to include `startDate`, `endDate`, `filterCompetitors`, and `media` (11:33:57 AM, then corrected at 11:51:18 AM).
        *   State variables `startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`, `timePeriod` are introduced, along with `handleDateRangeChange` and `handleEndDateChange` functions, to manage date selections for filtering (11:28:11 AM - 11:30:21 AM).
        *   The date input fields in the UI are uncommented and bound to these state variables.
        *   New states `selectedCompetitors`, `shareOfVoiceData`, `competitors` are added for the Share of Voice feature (11:39:14 AM).
        *   A second `useEffect` hook is added to fetch `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` data, depending on `selectedMediaTypes` and `selectedCompetitors` (11:39:14 AM).
    *   **Refinement of State Management (11:46:03 AM - 11:55:58 AM):**
        *   The `ShareofVoice` component takes on the responsibility of managing filter states (`selectedMediaTypes`, `selectedCompetitors`) and passing them, along with their setters, down to its child `MonthShareOfVoice`.
        *   A temporary duplication of `selectedMediaTypes` state occurs, quickly resolved (11:49:20 AM - 11:51:18 AM).
        *   A new state `selectedMediaTypes2` is introduced to allow separate media type filtering for the `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS` API call, distinguishing it from the `selectedMediaTypes` used for `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` (11:53:15 AM - 11:55:58 AM).

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11:39:43 AM):** This component is first logged, responsible for rendering a bar chart using `react-apexcharts`. It defines its own `selectedMediaTypes`, `selectedCompetitors`, `shareOfVoiceData`, and `competitors` states. It also includes an `useEffect` for fetching `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` data, mirroring the parent.
    *   **Refactoring for Parent-Child Communication (11:39:59 AM - 11:49:32 AM):**
        *   The component undergoes several iterations of commenting out and re-introducing its local state and data fetching `useEffect`.
        *   Ultimately, it is refactored to receive `shareOfVoiceData`, `mediaTypeOptions`, `competitorOptions`, `selectedCompetitors`, `setSelectedCompetitors`, `selectedMediaTypes`, and `setSelectedMediaTypes` as props (11:47:07 AM - 11:49:32 AM). This centralizes state management in the parent `ShareofVoice.jsx` component.
        *   It includes logic `transformDataForChart` to format `shareOfVoiceData` for the chart.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/10/2025, 11:19:15 AM:** Initial creation of `ShareofVoice.jsx` with static layout.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:21:34 AM:** First `useEffect` added to `ShareofVoice.jsx` for data fetching.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:22:42 AM:** `userService` imported and used for API calls.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:28:11 AM:** Introduction of date range state and handlers in `ShareofVoice.jsx`.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:36:46 AM:** `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` constant imported, signifying a new API integration.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:39:14 AM:** New `useEffect` for `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` and related states added to `ShareofVoice.jsx`.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:39:43 AM:** `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` component is first introduced.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:44:51 AM - 11:45:20 AM:** `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` is refactored to remove its own data fetching logic and rely on props.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:51:18 AM:** `payload` for `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS` is fully implemented in `ShareofVoice.jsx`.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:53:15 AM - 11:55:58 AM:** Introduction of `selectedMediaTypes2` in `ShareofVoice.jsx` to differentiate media type filters for different API calls.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development:** Changes often appear in rapid succession (e.g., within seconds or minutes), indicating an incremental development process where features are built up step-by-step, often with minor syntax fixes or completion of statements in subsequent commits.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The use of `ShareofVoice.jsx` as a parent orchestrating data fetching and passing data/setters to child components like `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` demonstrates a React component hierarchy.
*   **State Management with Hooks:** Heavy reliance on `useState` for managing component-specific data (e.g., `selectedMediaTypes`, `startDate`) and `useEffect` for handling side effects like data fetching.
*   **API Integration:** Consistent use of a `userService` and predefined constants from `constants.js` for interacting with backend APIs via `userService.post`.
*   **Data Transformation:** The `transformDataForChart` function in `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` indicates a pattern of adapting raw API response data into a format suitable for visualization libraries.
*   **Filtering and User Interaction:** The presence of `MultiSelectDropdown` components and date input fields suggests an emphasis on user-driven data filtering and dynamic content display.
*   **Refactoring for Responsibility:** An initial tendency to duplicate data fetching logic in both parent and child components (`ShareofVoice.jsx` and `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` both attempting to fetch `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` data) is observed, followed by a refactoring where the parent takes over data fetching and passes necessary data and update functions as props to the child.

## 12:58:26 PM
The provided log details significant development activity within the `skribefrontend` application, primarily focusing on the "Brand Dashboard" features related to "Share of Voice" and "Top Journalists."

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial State (10/10/2025, 12:00:18 PM to 12:33:13 PM)**: The component was entirely commented out, suggesting it was either under development, undergoing a major overhaul, or temporarily disabled.
    *   **Activation and Core Functionality (10/10/2025, 12:38:04 PM)**: This timestamp marks a pivotal change where the entire component was uncommented and made fully functional. This involved:
        *   Enabling all necessary React imports (`useEffect`, `useState`) and component imports (`BrandHeader`, `MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, `TopJournalists`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`).
        *   Integrating custom hooks (`useBrandMediaTypes`) and API services (`userService`).
        *   Defining state variables for managing time periods (`timePeriod`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`), journalist data (`topJournalistsData`, `topCompetitorJournalistsData`), share of voice data (`shareOfVoiceData`), competitor information (`selectedCompetitors`, `competitors`), and media types (`selectedMediaTypes`, `selectedMediaTypes2`).
        *   Implementing `useEffect` hooks for data fetching, including `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE`, `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS`, and a newly introduced `GET_TOP_COMETITOR_JOURNALIST` (though its definition is not in the `constants.js` entries provided in the log, its usage here is explicit).
        *   Adding comprehensive date range calculation logic (`calculateDateRange`) and event handlers for date inputs, including validation to prevent illogical date selections (e.g., end date before start date).
        *   The component's JSX structure was fully enabled, rendering various sub-components to build the "Brand Dashboard."
    *   **Minor Refinement (10/10/2025, 12:38:41 PM)**: Removal of `console.log` statements for API payloads, indicating a cleanup of development logs.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\TopJournalists.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial Development & Data Transformation (10/10/2025, 12:13:03 PM)**: The component was uncommented and refactored from using mock data to receiving `topJournalistsData` and `topCompetitorJournalistsData` via props. A `transformJournalistData` helper was introduced to map raw API responses (`intjid`, `vchauthor`, `count`) to a more structured format (`id`, `name`, `outlet`, `mentions`) for display. Basic "Add To CRM" and "Create List" buttons were enabled.
    *   **UI/UX Enhancements and Loading States (10/10/2025, 12:19:36 PM)**:
        *   An `isLoading` prop was added to display visual feedback ("Loading journalists data...", "Loading competitors data...") during data fetching.
        *   The display was updated to show the count of "found" journalists.
        *   "Add To CRM" and "Create List" buttons were conditionally disabled if no competition journalists were found.
        *   Error handling for broken profile images was implemented (`onError`).
        *   A `formatName` utility was added to capitalize journalist names consistently.
        *   The empty state message for the `JournalistTable` was improved to include suggestions like "Try adjusting your filters or date range."
    *   **Refinement of Empty State Display (10/10/2025, 12:24:53 PM to 12:29:20 PM)**: Several small iterations focused on correctly displaying "No Records Found" within the `JournalistTable` when `journalists` array is empty, moving from direct `<tbody>` text to a structured table row with `colSpan` and adjusting vertical padding (`py-30`).
    *   **CRM Integration & State Management (10/10/2025, 12:45:09 PM to 12:49:35 PM)**:
        *   A function `addToCRM` was introduced to handle adding selected journalists to a CRM system. This involved importing `useNotification` for user feedback and `PRECRM_POSTDATA` from `constants.js` for the API call. It included validation (e.g., max 5 journalists at a time) and notifications for success or hitting CRM limits.
        *   A significant re-architecture occurred at **10/10/2025, 12:48:27 PM**, where `useState` hooks for `selectedJournalistsId` and `competitionData` were explicitly added to `TopJournalists.jsx`. A `handleSelect` function was introduced for managing checkbox selections, and `JournalistTable` was updated to accept `selectedJournalistsId`, `handleSelect`, and `showCheckbox` props for granular control.
        *   However, the very next change at **10/10/2025, 12:49:35 PM** appears to be a partial revert of this precise state management, removing the `useState` hooks for `selectedJournalistsId` and `competitionData` from `TopJournalists`, which would likely break the `addToCRM` functionality as it relies on these states.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**:
    *   **API Endpoint Definitions (10/10/2025, 12:04:02 PM and 12:04:54 PM)**: This file consistently defines numerous API endpoints and static constants. The content remained identical across the two timestamps provided. These constants are crucial for the application's backend communication, covering authentication, user preferences, reports, campaigns, CRM, and various dashboard metrics (brand, influencer, spokesperson, topic, geo, etc.).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/10/2025, 12:38:04 PM**: `ShareofVoice.jsx` transitions from a commented-out placeholder to a fully operational component, integrating various sub-components and data fetching logic.
*   **10/10/2025, 12:13:03 PM**: `TopJournalists.jsx` is initially activated and refactored to work with dynamic data.
*   **10/10/2025, 12:19:36 PM**: `TopJournalists.jsx` receives substantial UI/UX improvements, including loading indicators and better handling of empty states.
*   **10/10/2025, 12:48:27 PM**: `TopJournalists.jsx` integrates CRM functionality with explicit state management, though this change appears to be partially reverted immediately after.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Component Design**: The `ShareofVoice` component acts as a parent, orchestrating data flow and rendering several child components like `MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, and `TopJournalists`.
*   **API-driven Data Flow**: Both `ShareofVoice` and `TopJournalists` heavily rely on fetching data from a backend API using a `userService` and processing the responses. A common pattern is checking for `res?.response?.status === "Ok"`.
*   **Date Range Filtering**: A consistent pattern of allowing users to select predefined or custom date ranges to filter displayed data across dashboard sections.
*   **User Feedback**: Implementation of `useNotification` for displaying success, warning, and error messages to the user.
*   **Environment Variable Configuration**: The `constants.js` file demonstrates a strong pattern of defining API base URLs and other configurable values using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables, ensuring easy configuration for different deployment environments.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: The multiple small changes to `TopJournalists.jsx`, especially concerning empty state rendering and CRM integration logic, indicate an iterative development process. The temporary commenting out of entire components also points to this.
