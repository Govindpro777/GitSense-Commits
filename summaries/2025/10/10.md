# Activity Summary for 10/10/2025

## 11:58:39 AM
The log primarily details the evolution of API endpoint definitions and the implementation of two React components related to brand analytics: `ShareofVoice.jsx` and `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/10/2025, 11:15:26 AM and 11:15:59 AM
    *   This file serves as a central repository for API endpoints and base URLs, many of which are derived from environment variables (e.g., `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_URL_V1`).
    *   It defines a wide array of URLs for authentication, user management, reporting, campaign management, CRM, search, social media integrations, and various dashboard metrics.
    *   A significant addition during this period is the import of `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` (Timestamp: 11:36:46 AM), indicating the introduction of a new API for share of voice data.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Initial State (11:19:15 AM):** The component starts as a static layout for a "Brand Dashboard" section, importing UI components like `BrandHeader`, `MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, `TopJournalists`, `DropdownComponent`, and `MultiSelectDropdown`. It initializes basic state for `lastDays` and `selectedMediaTypes`, and includes dummy data for journalists.
    *   **Introduction of Data Fetching (11:21:34 AM - 11:36:46 AM):**
        *   An `useEffect` hook is added to fetch data, initially with an incomplete API call.
        *   `userService` is introduced for making API requests (11:22:42 AM).
        *   The `getTopJournalist` async function is developed to fetch data using `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS`. The `payload` for this call is gradually introduced, commented out, then re-added and refined to include `startDate`, `endDate`, `filterCompetitors`, and `media` (11:33:57 AM, then corrected at 11:51:18 AM).
        *   State variables `startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`, `timePeriod` are introduced, along with `handleDateRangeChange` and `handleEndDateChange` functions, to manage date selections for filtering (11:28:11 AM - 11:30:21 AM).
        *   The date input fields in the UI are uncommented and bound to these state variables.
        *   New states `selectedCompetitors`, `shareOfVoiceData`, `competitors` are added for the Share of Voice feature (11:39:14 AM).
        *   A second `useEffect` hook is added to fetch `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` data, depending on `selectedMediaTypes` and `selectedCompetitors` (11:39:14 AM).
    *   **Refinement of State Management (11:46:03 AM - 11:55:58 AM):**
        *   The `ShareofVoice` component takes on the responsibility of managing filter states (`selectedMediaTypes`, `selectedCompetitors`) and passing them, along with their setters, down to its child `MonthShareOfVoice`.
        *   A temporary duplication of `selectedMediaTypes` state occurs, quickly resolved (11:49:20 AM - 11:51:18 AM).
        *   A new state `selectedMediaTypes2` is introduced to allow separate media type filtering for the `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS` API call, distinguishing it from the `selectedMediaTypes` used for `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` (11:53:15 AM - 11:55:58 AM).

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11:39:43 AM):** This component is first logged, responsible for rendering a bar chart using `react-apexcharts`. It defines its own `selectedMediaTypes`, `selectedCompetitors`, `shareOfVoiceData`, and `competitors` states. It also includes an `useEffect` for fetching `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` data, mirroring the parent.
    *   **Refactoring for Parent-Child Communication (11:39:59 AM - 11:49:32 AM):**
        *   The component undergoes several iterations of commenting out and re-introducing its local state and data fetching `useEffect`.
        *   Ultimately, it is refactored to receive `shareOfVoiceData`, `mediaTypeOptions`, `competitorOptions`, `selectedCompetitors`, `setSelectedCompetitors`, `selectedMediaTypes`, and `setSelectedMediaTypes` as props (11:47:07 AM - 11:49:32 AM). This centralizes state management in the parent `ShareofVoice.jsx` component.
        *   It includes logic `transformDataForChart` to format `shareOfVoiceData` for the chart.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/10/2025, 11:19:15 AM:** Initial creation of `ShareofVoice.jsx` with static layout.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:21:34 AM:** First `useEffect` added to `ShareofVoice.jsx` for data fetching.

*   **10/10/2025, 11:51:18 AM:** `payload` for `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS` is fully implemented in `ShareofVoice.jsx`.
*   **10/10/2025, 11:53:15 AM - 11:55:58 AM:** Introduction of `selectedMediaTypes2` in `ShareofVoice.jsx` to differentiate media type filters for different API calls.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development:** Changes often appear in rapid succession (e.g., within seconds or minutes), indicating an incremental development process where features are built up step-by-step, often with minor syntax fixes or completion of statements in subsequent commits.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The use of `ShareofVoice.jsx` as a parent orchestrating data fetching and passing data/setters to child components like `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` demonstrates a React component hierarchy.
*   **State Management with Hooks:** Heavy reliance on `useState` for managing component-specific data (e.g., `selectedMediaTypes`, `startDate`) and `useEffect` for handling side effects like data fetching.
*   **API Integration:** Consistent use of a `userService` and predefined constants from `constants.js` for interacting with backend APIs via `userService.post`.
*   **Data Transformation:** The `transformDataForChart` function in `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` indicates a pattern of adapting raw API response data into a format suitable for visualization libraries.
*   **Filtering and User Interaction:** The presence of `MultiSelectDropdown` components and date input fields suggests an emphasis on user-driven data filtering and dynamic content display.
*   **Refactoring for Responsibility:** An initial tendency to duplicate data fetching logic in both parent and child components (`ShareofVoice.jsx` and `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` both attempting to fetch `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE` data) is observed, followed by a refactoring where the parent takes over data fetching and passes necessary data and update functions as props to the child.
