# Activity Summary for 10/26/2025

The `ForgotPassword.jsx` file, located at `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\src\pages\ForgotPassword.jsx`, was last significantly modified or reviewed on `10/24/2025, 11:02:18 PM`.

The key information about this file is that its *entire content is commented out*. This indicates that the `ForgotPassword` React component, along with all its associated logic, UI, and functionality, is currently inactive or has been temporarily disabled.

Despite being commented out, the code reveals a detailed implementation for a multi-step password reset process:
*   **State Management:** It uses `useState` hooks to manage the current `step` ("email", "otp", "success"), `formData` (for email, OTP, new password, and confirmation), `errors` for validation feedback, and a `loading` state for asynchronous operations.
*   **Event Handlers:** `handleChange` updates form data and clears errors, `handleEmailSubmit` handles the submission of the user's email to request an OTP, and `handleResetSubmit` handles the submission of the OTP and new passwords.
*   **Validation:** Robust client-side validation is implemented for email format, OTP length (6 digits), new password length (minimum 6 characters), and password confirmation matching.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** The code includes `try...catch...finally` blocks for simulated API calls (using `setTimeout`) to send OTP and reset the password, demonstrating a pattern for handling loading states and potential errors.
*   **User Interface:** It defines separate rendering functions (`renderEmailStep`, `renderOTPStep`) for each stage of the password reset flow. The UI incorporates icons from `lucide-react` (Mail, Shield, ArrowRight, ArrowLeft, CheckCircle) and `react-icons/fa` (FaSpinner for loading states). It also includes a `Link` component for navigation back to the sign-in page.
*   **Styling:** The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design, input styling, button interactions, and displaying error messages effectively.

The overarching pattern is the complete commenting out of a functional component, suggesting it might be under refactoring, replaced by another implementation, or held as a reference for future development.
