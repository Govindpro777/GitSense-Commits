## 11:52:55 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx` was modified at 10/15/2025, 11:35:12 AM. The primary change was in how the brand name is displayed in the main heading. Initially, it attempted to display `sentimentScoreData?.brandName || "Loading..."`. The update changed this to `brandName || "Brand Dashboard"`, and crucially, it introduced `const { value: brandName } = useLocalStorage("brandName");` to explicitly retrieve the brand name from local storage, standardizing its source.

Similarly, the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\MediaScore\MediaScore.jsx` was updated at 10/15/2025, 11:39:41 AM. Prior to this, the `h1` tag used `{brandName || "Brand Dashboard"}` but the `brandName` variable was not defined within the component's scope. The change addressed this by adding `const { value: brandName } = useLocalStorage("brandName");`, ensuring that the `MediaScore` component correctly fetches and displays the brand name from local storage.

A clear pattern emerges from these changes: both files, `Sentiment.jsx` and `MediaScore.jsx`, were updated on the same day (10/15/2025) to standardize the retrieval and display of the `brandName` in their main headings. This was achieved by consistently using the `useLocalStorage("brandName")` custom hook, suggesting an effort to centralize and ensure consistency in how the brand identifier is managed across different parts of the frontend application.

## 12:53:27 PM
The provided log details changes across three key frontend components related to brand monitoring and reporting: `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`, `ShareofVoice.jsx`, and `SentimentChart.jsx`, along with `TopJournalists.jsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`**
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:02:25 PM:** The component was uncommented and activated, initially including a `useEffect` to set default selected media types and competitors (first three) on mount.
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:07:16 PM:** The `useEffect` hook for default selection was immediately removed.
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:15:23 PM - 12:17:35 PM:** The `useNotification` hook was introduced and integrated. Initial attempts were made to add validation logic for competitor selection (`maxSelected` function), with placeholder notification messages.
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:18:59 PM - 12:19:59 PM:** A new `handleCompetitorSelection` function was implemented, encapsulating logic for adding/removing competitors and validating against a maximum of 3 selections. The `maxSelected` function was subsequently removed.
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:23:55 PM:** The `handleCompetitorSelection` logic was enhanced to enforce both a minimum (at least one) and a maximum (up to three) selected competitors, displaying warnings via `useNotification` for violations.
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:32:18 PM - 12:35:54 PM:** The competitor selection validation logic in `handleCompetitorSelection` underwent several refinements and a significant refactor to ensure correct state updates and notification triggers, clearly separating adding, removing, and validation checks.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:07:23 PM - 12:08:51 PM:** The entire component was commented out, indicating a temporary deactivation or ongoing refactoring. It included various state management, API calls for share of voice data, journalists, and date range handling.
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:20:31 PM:** The component was uncommented and activated. A `useEffect` hook was added to automatically select the first three competitor options if none were selected.
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:25:14 PM:** The `useEffect` for auto-selecting competitor options was commented out, reverting this behavior.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Spokesperson\SentimentChart.jsx`**
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:42:51 PM:** The component was activated, displaying spokesperson sentiment via a bar chart (Positive, Neutral, Negative) and a sentiment score, fetching data from an API based on date range.
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:43:01 PM - 12:43:13 PM:** The color scheme for the sentiment bar chart was adjusted multiple times, eventually settling on `["#16A34A", "#EAB308", "#EF4444"]` for Positive, Neutral, and Negative respectively.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\TopJournalists.jsx`**
    *   **10/15/2025, 12:47:03 PM:** This component was activated. It displays top journalists for the brand and competition, allowing users to select journalists to "Add To CRM" (with validation for 1-5 journalists and a total CRM limit) or "Create List" via a `BuildCampaign` popup. It uses a `JournalistTable` sub-component to render journalist details, including images fetched from `baseURL`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/15/2025, 12:02:25 PM:** Initial activation and attempted auto-selection in `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:18:59 PM:** Introduction of `handleCompetitorSelection` and initial max selection validation in `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:20:31 PM:** Reactivation of `ShareofVoice.jsx` with an attempt at global competitor auto-selection.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:23:55 PM:** Refinement of competitor selection in `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` to include both minimum and maximum limits.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:35:54 PM:** Major refactor of competitor selection logic in `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` for robustness.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:43:13 PM:** Finalization of sentiment chart colors in `SentimentChart.jsx`.
*   **10/15/2025, 12:47:03 PM:** Activation of `TopJournalists.jsx` with CRM and media list functionalities.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Commenting/Uncommenting:** Multiple files, especially `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` and `ShareofVoice.jsx`, show a pattern of being entirely commented out and then uncommented, indicating active development, feature toggling, or debugging phases.
*   **Rapid Iteration on Validation Logic:** Within `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`, the validation for selecting competitors (min/max limits) underwent several quick iterations and refactors, suggesting a focused effort on making this user interaction robust.
*   **Integration of `useNotification`:** The `useNotification` hook is consistently introduced across components (`MonthShareOfVoice.jsx`, `TopJournalists.jsx`) to provide user feedback through alerts and warnings, becoming a standardized way to communicate issues or success.
*   **Chart Visualization:** `react-apexcharts` is a recurring dependency for data visualization, as seen in both `MonthShareOfVoice.jsx` (bar chart for share of voice) and `SentimentChart.jsx` (bar chart for sentiment).
*   **Data Fetching:** API calls using `userService.post` and `userService.get` are prominent, fetching various brand-related metrics from backend endpoints defined in `constants`.
*   **UI Component Reuse:** `MultiSelectDropdown` is a key reusable UI component for filtering data based on media types and competitors.
*   **Date Range Management:** `ShareofVoice.jsx` shows detailed logic for handling flexible date ranges (predefined and custom), a common requirement for analytical dashboards.
