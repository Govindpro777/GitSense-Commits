The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Sentiment\Sentiment.jsx` was modified at 10/15/2025, 11:35:12 AM. The primary change was in how the brand name is displayed in the main heading. Initially, it attempted to display `sentimentScoreData?.brandName || "Loading..."`. The update changed this to `brandName || "Brand Dashboard"`, and crucially, it introduced `const { value: brandName } = useLocalStorage("brandName");` to explicitly retrieve the brand name from local storage, standardizing its source.

Similarly, the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\MediaScore\MediaScore.jsx` was updated at 10/15/2025, 11:39:41 AM. Prior to this, the `h1` tag used `{brandName || "Brand Dashboard"}` but the `brandName` variable was not defined within the component's scope. The change addressed this by adding `const { value: brandName } = useLocalStorage("brandName");`, ensuring that the `MediaScore` component correctly fetches and displays the brand name from local storage.

A clear pattern emerges from these changes: both files, `Sentiment.jsx` and `MediaScore.jsx`, were updated on the same day (10/15/2025) to standardize the retrieval and display of the `brandName` in their main headings. This was achieved by consistently using the `useLocalStorage("brandName")` custom hook, suggesting an effort to centralize and ensure consistency in how the brand identifier is managed across different parts of the frontend application.
