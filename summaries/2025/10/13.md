# Activity Summary for 10/13/2025

## 4:01:50 PM
The log details changes occurring within a "SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END" project, specifically focusing on API endpoint definitions and an article display component, all transpiring on October 13, 2025.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**

This file, updated multiple times between 3:34:42 PM and 3:40:24 PM, consistently defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints for the frontend application. No functional code changes were introduced across these entries. Key aspects include:
*   **Environment Variables**: Many base URLs (`Url_V1`, `url`, `ATTACH_URL`, `CHAI_TIME`, `RESETPASS`, `SOCIALURL`) are fetched from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...` variables, indicating a configurable environment.
*   **Authentication & User Management**: Endpoints cover login, signup, social access, token generation/resolution, user info, OTP generation, refresh tokens, password reset, and password changes.
*   **Content & Data Retrieval**: APIs for career openings, beatwatch articles, CRM data, user preferences (geo, media, beats, competitors, topics, brands, spokespersons), outlet by media type, and general journalist data.
*   **Campaign Management**: Extensive set of APIs for creating, getting, updating, deleting campaigns/lists, managing journalists within lists, email quotas, and sending emails.
*   **Reporting & Analytics**: Endpoints for various reports related to brands (beat, aggregation, articles), influencers, spokespersons, and topics (keyword, articles, website aggregation, author aggregation). Dashboard-related APIs for usage statistics, trending/favorite journalists, and BeatWatch.
*   **Media & Social Integration**: APIs for Instagram and Twitter data, including filtering by category, city, outlet, and beat.
*   **Brand Tracking**: Functionality to add/deactivate brands, spokespersons, and associated keywords, along with competitor management.
*   **Content & Multimedia**: Paths for journalist images, outlet images, supplement images, Skribe Extra content, podcast data, and attachment management.
*   **Miscellaneous**: Constants for a static count (1000) for "select all" functionality and a "Freebies" string.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Catalog\Articles.jsx`**

This file underwent a series of iterative refinements between 3:37:34 PM and 4:00:51 PM, focusing on how articles are fetched, filtered, and displayed in a Brand Catalog.

*   **Initial Setup (3:37:34 PM)**: The component fetched articles using `BRANDARTICLES` (a POST request) and outlet filter options using `GET_CATALOG_OUTLET_FILTER` (also a POST request). Outlet options were mapped using `i?.value`. The `selectedSentiment` state was initialized to "Sentiment Type".
*   **API Call Method Change (3:38:32 PM)**: The `getOutletFilterOptions` function was updated to use `userService.get` instead of `userService.post` for `GET_CATALOG_OUTLET_FILTER`.
*   **Outlet Option Mapping (3:39:30 PM)**: The mapping for `outletOptions` in `getOutletFilterOptions` was changed from `i?.value` to `i?.vchwebsite`.
*   **API Endpoint Update (3:41:41 PM)**: The constant used for fetching articles was changed from `BRANDARTICLES` to `GET_CATALOG_ARTICLES`.
*   **Sentiment Filtering Integration (3:43:14 PM)**: The `getArticlesData` payload was expanded to include `selectedSentiment` as a filter criterion.
*   **Sentiment State Initialization (3:44:02 PM)**: The `selectedSentiment` state's initial value was changed from `"Sentiment Type"` to an empty string `""`.
*   **Effect Dependency Update (3:46:48 PM)**: The `useEffect` dependency arrays were modified to include `selectedSentiment`, ensuring article data refetches when the sentiment filter changes.
*   **Sentiment Option Casing (3:48:26 PM)**: The `sentimentTypeOptions` array values were changed to lowercase (e.g., "Positive" to "positive").
*   **Sentiment Payload Formatting (3:49:56 PM & 3:50:46 PM)**: The `getArticlesData` function was updated to format the `selectedSentiment` for the API payload, specifically converting the first character to lowercase (e.g., "Positive" becomes "positive"). A minor correction was made in the second timestamp to correctly call `toLowerCase()` as a function.
*   **Article Card Property Casing (3:52:52 PM, 3:53:55 PM, 3:57:11 PM)**: Several properties used to display article information within the `ArticleCard` component were changed from camelCase to lowercase: `article?.vchTitle` to `article?.vchtitle`, `article?.vchUrl` to `article?.vchurl`, `article?.dtmPublishDate` to `article?.dtmpublishdate`, and `article?.mtxtArticleSummary` to `article?.mtxtarticlesummary`. These likely reflect a change in the casing of property names returned by the API.
*   **Sentiment State Reversion (3:58:23 PM)**: The `selectedSentiment` state's initial value was reverted to `"Sentiment Type"`.
*   **Conditional Sentiment Payload (4:00:51 PM)**: A conditional check was added in `getArticlesData` to only include the `sentiment` in the API payload if `selectedSentiment` is not equal to `"Sentiment Type"`. This ensures that "Sentiment Type" (which is the default display text) is not sent as an actual filter value.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Endpoint Organization**: The `constants.js` file demonstrates a clear pattern of centralizing API endpoint definitions, with most endpoints prefixed by `Url_V1`. Many of these are concatenation of `Url_V1` with specific path segments, such as `authenticate/login`, `userpreference/preferences`, `CreateList`, `reporting`, etc.
*   **Environment Variable Usage**: Consistent use of `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_` for base URLs and other critical configuration, highlighting an approach for managing different environments.
*   **Date Range Filtering**: The `Articles.jsx` component consistently implements date range filtering with predefined options ("Past 24 hours", "Last 3 days", "Last 1 week", "Last 1 month", "Last 6 months", "Custom Date Range") and associated logic to calculate start and end dates.
*   **Pagination Logic**: A standard pagination implementation is present in `Articles.jsx`, with `currentPage`, `articlesPerPage`, `totalArticles`, and `totalPages` states, along with `handlePagination` function.
*   **Filter UI Components**: The use of `DropdownComponent` and `MultiSelectDropdown` suggests reusable UI components for filtering.
*   **API Data Casing**: The repeated changes in `Articles.jsx` from camelCase to lowercase for article data properties (`vchTitle` to `vchtitle`, `dtmPublishDate` to `dtmpublishdate`, etc.) indicate an adjustment to match the actual casing of properties received from the backend API.
*   **Sentiment Filtering Refinement**: Multiple changes to how `selectedSentiment` is handled (initial state, API payload formatting, `useEffect` dependencies, and conditional inclusion) show an iterative process of refining a user-facing filter to work correctly with the backend.

## 5:02:05 PM
The changes log details updates across three frontend JavaScript/React files, primarily focusing on data fetching, state management, and UI rendering.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Catalog\Articles.jsx`**
    *   **10/13/2025, 4:02:38 PM:** The `Articles` component was configured to display articles with filtering options for date range, outlets, and sentiment. It initialized the `selectedSentiment` filter to `"Sentiment Type"`.
    *   **10/13/2025, 4:03:00 PM:** A minor but significant update changed the default value and comparison logic for `selectedSentiment` from `"Sentiment Type"` to `"All Sentiment"`, affecting how sentiment filtering is applied when fetching article data.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**
    *   **10/13/2025, 4:13:59 PM:** This file serves as a central repository for various API endpoints and constant values. It defines URLs for authentication, user information, reports, settings, campaigns, CRM, journalists, social media platforms, and brand-related dashboards. Key constants like `Url_V1`, `baseURL`, `ATTACH_URL`, and specific API paths like `GET_CATALOG_ARTICLES`, `GET_CATALOG_OUTLET_FILTER`, and `GET_INDUSTRY_RANKING` are established here. No specific changes were recorded for this file within the log, indicating its role as a stable configuration source.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\IndustryRanking\IndustryRanking.jsx`**
    *   **Initial State (10/13/2025, 4:14:26 PM - 4:15:02 PM):** The component began with static UI placeholders for "Industry Ranking - Top Company" and "Your Brand Ranking," displaying hardcoded data like "Company 1" and "90" scores.
    *   **Data Fetching Integration (10/13/2025, 4:16:22 PM - 4:22:37 PM):** The component was progressively updated to integrate `useEffect` and `useState` hooks. It started importing `userService` and `GET_INDUSTRY_RANKING` to fetch real data. The API call URL and basic error handling within a `try-catch` block were established, along with initializing a `IndustryRankingData` state. The `"use client";` directive was added.
    *   **Major Refactor and Dynamic Rendering (10/13/2025, 4:32:42 PM):** This timestamp marks a significant overhaul. A commented-out previous version of the code was left as reference. The component was reimplemented to fetch `rankedData` and `brandName` from the API response (`res?.data?.rankedData`, `res?.data?.brandName`). The `useEffect` hook was correctly set to run once on mount (with `[]` dependency). The UI was updated to dynamically render the brand name in the header, and the "Industry Ranking" table now maps over `IndustryRankingData` to display `item.industryRank`, `item.brandName`, and `item.score`. The "Your Brand Ranking" section also started displaying dynamic data based on the fetched `brandName` and its rank.
    *   **Iterative Refinements (10/13/2025, 4:32:58 PM - 4:51:35 PM):** Following the major refactor, there was a series of small, iterative changes:
        *   Temporary regressions (e.g., removing dynamic data, incomplete state declarations) were observed and then corrected.
        *   State variable `branName` was consistently renamed to `brandName` for camelCase compliance.
        *   The `useEffect` hook was ensured to correctly `await` the `userService.get` call.
        *   The logic to find `brandRank` within `industryRankingData` based on `brandName` was progressively completed and refined.
        *   The "Your Brand Ranking" section was updated to display the first character of the `brandName` and its `industryRank`.
    *   **Conditional Display for No Data (10/13/2025, 4:52:46 PM - 5:00:59 PM):** The component was enhanced with conditional rendering for the "Your Brand Ranking" section. If `brandRank` is `undefined` or its `score` is `0`, a message "No Article Published in the Previous Months" is displayed, otherwise, the full ranking details are shown. Minor styling adjustments (e.g., `h-60` class) were applied to the "no data" section.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frontend Technologies:** The log consistently shows React component development using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and side effects, and implicitly Tailwind CSS for styling (indicated by utility classes in JSX).
*   **API Interactions:** Both `Articles.jsx` and `IndustryRanking.jsx` heavily rely on `userService` (a custom service likely abstracting API calls) to fetch data using constants defined in `src/constants.js`. API responses are consistently checked for `res?.response?.status === "Ok"`.
*   **Iterative Development & Debugging:** The numerous small, consecutive changes in `IndustryRanking.jsx`, including incomplete code snippets and subsequent corrections, suggest an iterative development process, possibly with real-time feedback or debugging.
*   **Dynamic UI Rendering:** Components dynamically render data fetched from APIs, rather than relying on static placeholders, which is a core principle of modern web applications.
*   **Error Handling:** `try-catch` blocks are consistently used around API calls to log potential errors, demonstrating a focus on robustness.

## 6:02:12 PM
The provided logs detail a series of incremental and a few significant changes to the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\IndustryRanking\IndustryRanking.jsx` within a short timeframe on **October 13, 2025**. This file appears to be a React component responsible for displaying industry rankings and a specific brand's ranking.

Key information and changes:

**File-Specific Updates (`IndustryRanking.jsx`):**

1.  **Initial State (5:02:38 PM):** The component fetches industry ranking data using `userService.get(GET_INDUSTRY_RANKING?Period=1)` on mount. It displays a "Top Company" industry ranking table and a "Your Brand Ranking" section. This latter section conditionally shows "No Article Published in the Previous Months" if `brandRank` is `undefined` or `brandRank?.score != 0`, otherwise it shows the brand's rank.
2.  **Minor Styling Adjustments (5:02:57 PM - 5:05:32 PM):**
    *   There were several small, sequential changes to the `max-w` (maximum width) Tailwind CSS class on the `<p>` tag displaying "No Article Published in the Previous Months". It went from `w-full` to `max-w-50`, then `max-w-48`, `max-w-40`, `max-w-36`, `max-w-34`.
    *   The `px` (horizontal padding) class on the "No Article Published" section's `<section>` tag was adjusted from `px-20` to `px-10` (5:04:27 PM), then reverted to `px-20` for the *ranked* section (5:04:41 PM), while the "No Article Published" section kept `px-10`.
    *   The `max-w-34` class was moved from the `<p>` tag to the parent `<section>` tag (5:05:06 PM), then replaced with `w-40` (5:05:24 PM), and finally removed (5:05:32 PM).
3.  **Conditional Logic Toggles (5:03:35 PM, 5:04:01 PM, 5:07:50 PM, 5:11:33 PM):**
    *   The condition for displaying "No Article Published" was initially `brandRank === undefined || brandRank?.score != 0`.
    *   It was changed to `brandRank === undefined || brandRank?.score === 0` at **5:03:35 PM**, which is a logical correction (show "No Article Published" if score is 0).
    *   This correct logic was then reverted at **5:04:01 PM** back to `brandRank === undefined || brandRank?.score != 0`.
    *   It was corrected again at **5:07:50 PM** to `brandRank === undefined || brandRank?.score === 0`.
    *   Finally, it was reverted back to the logically flawed `brandRank === undefined || brandRank?.score != 0` at **5:11:33 PM**.
4.  **Layout Structure Changes (5:07:16 PM, 5:07:31 PM, 5:11:19 PM):**
    *   At **5:07:16 PM**, the main layout `div` received `w-full`, and the two main content `section` elements were given explicit widths: the "Industry Ranking - Top Company" section became `w-3/4` and the "Your Brand Ranking" section (both variants) became `w-1/4`.
    *   This layout change was fully reverted at **5:11:19 PM**, restoring the initial flexible `w-full flex-1` and removing explicit `w-full` from the parent `div`.
5.  **Styling Overhaul and Revert (5:10:30 PM, 5:10:42 PM):**
    *   A significant styling update for the *ranked* "Your Brand Ranking" section was introduced at **5:10:30 PM**. This involved changing `rounded-lg` to `rounded-2xl` for the section and internal `div`s, replacing a simple `p` tag with a more complex styled `div` for the brand initial (e.g., `bg-white text-[#716AFC] w-20 h-20 flex items-center justify-center text-4xl font-semibold rounded-full shadow-md`), and modifying padding values.
    *   Remarkably, this entire refactored section was *immediately reverted* at **5:10:42 PM**, restoring the styling to its state prior to the overhaul, with the brand initial back to a simple `p` tag with `p-6` padding.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/13/2025, 5:03:35 PM**: First logical correction of the conditional `score != 0` to `score === 0`.
*   **10/13/2025, 5:04:01 PM**: Revert of the conditional logic, reintroducing the logical flaw.
*   **10/13/2025, 5:07:16 PM - 5:07:31 PM**: Introduction of explicit `w-3/4` and `w-1/4` column widths for layout.
*   **10/13/2025, 5:07:50 PM**: Second logical correction of the conditional `score != 0` to `score === 0`.
*   **10/13/2025, 5:10:30 PM**: Major styling redesign for the "Your Brand Ranking" section.
*   **10/13/2025, 5:10:42 PM**: Immediate revert of the major styling redesign.
*   **10/13/2025, 5:11:19 PM**: Revert of the explicit column width layout.
*   **10/13/2025, 5:11:33 PM**: Final revert of the conditional logic, returning to `score != 0` for "No Article Published".

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Tailwind CSS Class Adjustments**: There's a clear pattern of granular adjustments to Tailwind CSS utility classes, especially for `max-w`, `px`, and `w` properties, suggesting fine-tuning of UI spacing and responsiveness.
*   **Conditional Logic Fluctuation**: The repeated change and revert of the `brandRank?.score` condition indicates a struggle or indecision regarding the exact logic for displaying "No Article Published." It toggles between showing the message when `score === 0` (logically sound) and when `score != 0` (logically flawed for "No Article Published").
*   **Styling Experimentation and Reversion**: A significant styling change (5:10:30 PM) for the brand ranking display was swiftly reverted, suggesting a trial that was either not approved or introduced unexpected issues.
*   **Layout Experimentation and Reversion**: Similarly, layout adjustments using explicit `w-3/4` and `w-1/4` were introduced and then reverted, indicating an attempt to control column widths that was ultimately undone.
*   **Redundant Class Introduction**: At one point (5:06:37 PM), a redundant `border` class was added to a section, which was later removed (5:11:19 PM).

Overall, the log reflects a rapid series of UI/UX adjustments, including fine-tuning spacing, experimenting with layout structures, attempting a visual redesign, and repeatedly correcting/reverting a piece of conditional display logic.
