# Activity Summary for 10/13/2025

## 4:01:50 PM
The log details changes occurring within a "SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END" project, specifically focusing on API endpoint definitions and an article display component, all transpiring on October 13, 2025.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**

This file, updated multiple times between 3:34:42 PM and 3:40:24 PM, consistently defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints for the frontend application. No functional code changes were introduced across these entries. Key aspects include:
*   **Environment Variables**: Many base URLs (`Url_V1`, `url`, `ATTACH_URL`, `CHAI_TIME`, `RESETPASS`, `SOCIALURL`) are fetched from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...` variables, indicating a configurable environment.
*   **Authentication & User Management**: Endpoints cover login, signup, social access, token generation/resolution, user info, OTP generation, refresh tokens, password reset, and password changes.
*   **Content & Data Retrieval**: APIs for career openings, beatwatch articles, CRM data, user preferences (geo, media, beats, competitors, topics, brands, spokespersons), outlet by media type, and general journalist data.
*   **Campaign Management**: Extensive set of APIs for creating, getting, updating, deleting campaigns/lists, managing journalists within lists, email quotas, and sending emails.
*   **Reporting & Analytics**: Endpoints for various reports related to brands (beat, aggregation, articles), influencers, spokespersons, and topics (keyword, articles, website aggregation, author aggregation). Dashboard-related APIs for usage statistics, trending/favorite journalists, and BeatWatch.
*   **Media & Social Integration**: APIs for Instagram and Twitter data, including filtering by category, city, outlet, and beat.
*   **Brand Tracking**: Functionality to add/deactivate brands, spokespersons, and associated keywords, along with competitor management.
*   **Content & Multimedia**: Paths for journalist images, outlet images, supplement images, Skribe Extra content, podcast data, and attachment management.
*   **Miscellaneous**: Constants for a static count (1000) for "select all" functionality and a "Freebies" string.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Catalog\Articles.jsx`**

This file underwent a series of iterative refinements between 3:37:34 PM and 4:00:51 PM, focusing on how articles are fetched, filtered, and displayed in a Brand Catalog.

*   **Initial Setup (3:37:34 PM)**: The component fetched articles using `BRANDARTICLES` (a POST request) and outlet filter options using `GET_CATALOG_OUTLET_FILTER` (also a POST request). Outlet options were mapped using `i?.value`. The `selectedSentiment` state was initialized to "Sentiment Type".
*   **API Call Method Change (3:38:32 PM)**: The `getOutletFilterOptions` function was updated to use `userService.get` instead of `userService.post` for `GET_CATALOG_OUTLET_FILTER`.
*   **Outlet Option Mapping (3:39:30 PM)**: The mapping for `outletOptions` in `getOutletFilterOptions` was changed from `i?.value` to `i?.vchwebsite`.
*   **API Endpoint Update (3:41:41 PM)**: The constant used for fetching articles was changed from `BRANDARTICLES` to `GET_CATALOG_ARTICLES`.
*   **Sentiment Filtering Integration (3:43:14 PM)**: The `getArticlesData` payload was expanded to include `selectedSentiment` as a filter criterion.
*   **Sentiment State Initialization (3:44:02 PM)**: The `selectedSentiment` state's initial value was changed from `"Sentiment Type"` to an empty string `""`.
*   **Effect Dependency Update (3:46:48 PM)**: The `useEffect` dependency arrays were modified to include `selectedSentiment`, ensuring article data refetches when the sentiment filter changes.
*   **Sentiment Option Casing (3:48:26 PM)**: The `sentimentTypeOptions` array values were changed to lowercase (e.g., "Positive" to "positive").
*   **Sentiment Payload Formatting (3:49:56 PM & 3:50:46 PM)**: The `getArticlesData` function was updated to format the `selectedSentiment` for the API payload, specifically converting the first character to lowercase (e.g., "Positive" becomes "positive"). A minor correction was made in the second timestamp to correctly call `toLowerCase()` as a function.
*   **Article Card Property Casing (3:52:52 PM, 3:53:55 PM, 3:57:11 PM)**: Several properties used to display article information within the `ArticleCard` component were changed from camelCase to lowercase: `article?.vchTitle` to `article?.vchtitle`, `article?.vchUrl` to `article?.vchurl`, `article?.dtmPublishDate` to `article?.dtmpublishdate`, and `article?.mtxtArticleSummary` to `article?.mtxtarticlesummary`. These likely reflect a change in the casing of property names returned by the API.
*   **Sentiment State Reversion (3:58:23 PM)**: The `selectedSentiment` state's initial value was reverted to `"Sentiment Type"`.
*   **Conditional Sentiment Payload (4:00:51 PM)**: A conditional check was added in `getArticlesData` to only include the `sentiment` in the API payload if `selectedSentiment` is not equal to `"Sentiment Type"`. This ensures that "Sentiment Type" (which is the default display text) is not sent as an actual filter value.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API Endpoint Organization**: The `constants.js` file demonstrates a clear pattern of centralizing API endpoint definitions, with most endpoints prefixed by `Url_V1`. Many of these are concatenation of `Url_V1` with specific path segments, such as `authenticate/login`, `userpreference/preferences`, `CreateList`, `reporting`, etc.
*   **Environment Variable Usage**: Consistent use of `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_` for base URLs and other critical configuration, highlighting an approach for managing different environments.
*   **Date Range Filtering**: The `Articles.jsx` component consistently implements date range filtering with predefined options ("Past 24 hours", "Last 3 days", "Last 1 week", "Last 1 month", "Last 6 months", "Custom Date Range") and associated logic to calculate start and end dates.
*   **Pagination Logic**: A standard pagination implementation is present in `Articles.jsx`, with `currentPage`, `articlesPerPage`, `totalArticles`, and `totalPages` states, along with `handlePagination` function.
*   **Filter UI Components**: The use of `DropdownComponent` and `MultiSelectDropdown` suggests reusable UI components for filtering.
*   **API Data Casing**: The repeated changes in `Articles.jsx` from camelCase to lowercase for article data properties (`vchTitle` to `vchtitle`, `dtmPublishDate` to `dtmpublishdate`, etc.) indicate an adjustment to match the actual casing of properties received from the backend API.
*   **Sentiment Filtering Refinement**: Multiple changes to how `selectedSentiment` is handled (initial state, API payload formatting, `useEffect` dependencies, and conditional inclusion) show an iterative process of refining a user-facing filter to work correctly with the backend.
