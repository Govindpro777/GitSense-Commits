# Activity Summary for 10/14/2025

## 11:14:50 AM
The log details changes across two primary files: `src\constants.js` and `src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`, along with `src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\PieChartSection.jsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** Changes recorded between 10/14/2025, 10:16:39 AM and 10/14/2025, 10:34:16 AM.
    *   **Content:** This file consistently defines a large set of API endpoints for various functionalities (authentication, user preferences, CRM, campaigns, reports, social media integrations, brand tracking) using template literals with a base `Url_V1` and other environment variables. There are no content differences across the multiple entries in the log for this file, suggesting the entries might be capturing saves without actual code modifications, or changes were reverted.
    *   **Key APIs defined include:** Login, Signup, Password Reset, User Info, OTP generation, Refresh Token, Career openings, Beatwatch articles, CRM operations, User preferences (geo, media type, beats, competitors, topics, brands, spokespersons), Outlet by media type, Campaign list management (create, get, delete, send mail), Email quota, Journalist portfolio, various reporting APIs (Brand, Influencer, Spokesperson, Topic), Search functionalities, Podcast, Contact form, Dashboard analytics (Usage Statistics, Trending Journalists, Skribe365, Favourites, BeatWatch), Instagram and Twitter integrations, Geo statistics, Brand Dashboard metrics (Language, Sentiment, Share of Voice, City-wise count, Top Journalist, Articles), and Brand/Competitor tracking (add, deactivate).

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** Active development occurred between 10/14/2025, 10:37:06 AM and 10/14/2025, 11:04:36 AM.
    *   **Content Changes:**
        *   **Initial state (10:37:06 AM):** The component sets up state variables for `timePeriod`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`, `topJournalistsData`, `topCompetitorJournalistsData`, `selectedCompetitors`, `shareOfVoiceData`, `competitors`, `selectedMediaTypes`, and `selectedMediaTypes2`. It initializes the date range to "Last 1 month" and fetches `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE`, `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS`, and `GET_TOP_COMETITOR_JOURNALIST` data via `useEffect` hooks. Date range calculation and input handling are implemented.
        *   **Incremental addition of `getShareOfVoiceMention` (10:38:54 AM - 10:41:19 AM):** An empty async function `getShareOfVoiceMention` was initially added, then gradually filled with a `try...catch` block, a `userService.post` call using `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE_MENTION`, and a `payload` object including `media: selectedMediaTypes2`.
        *   **State management for `shareOfVoiceMention` (10:43:10 AM - 10:44:00 AM):** A new state variable `shareOfVoiceMention` was introduced. The `getShareOfVoiceMention` function was updated to store the fetched data (`res?.data || []`) into this state upon a successful API response (`res?.response?.status === "Ok"`).
        *   **API call trigger (10:44:16 AM):** The `getShareOfVoiceMention()` call was added to the `useEffect` hook that already handles fetching top journalists, ensuring it triggers when `startDate`, `endDate`, `selectedCompetitors`, or `selectedMediaTypes2` change.
        *   **Prop pass to child component (11:04:36 AM):** The newly managed `shareOfVoiceMention` state was passed as a prop to the `PieChartSection` component.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\PieChartSection.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** Active development occurred between 10/14/2025, 11:12:14 AM and 10/14/2025, 11:14:01 AM.
    *   **Content Changes:**
        *   **Initial Static Chart (11:12:14 AM):** The component rendered a single pie chart using static data for series and labels. It received `shareOfVoiceMention` as a prop but didn't utilize it in the chart data.
        *   **Dynamic Charting and Refactoring (11:13:10 AM):** The component was significantly refactored. The old code was commented out (and later removed). The new implementation introduced three distinct pie chart configurations: `realDataConfig` for "Share of Voice by Mentions", `reachDataConfig` for "Share of Voice by Reach", and `averageDataConfig`. Crucially, the "Share of Voice by Mentions" chart (`realDataConfig`) was updated to dynamically use the `shareOfVoiceMention` prop for its `series` (using `item.count`) and `labels` (using `item.brand_name`). It also added a tooltip formatter to display percentages. The other two charts (`reachDataConfig`, `averageDataConfig`) continued to use dummy data. The component now maps over these configurations to render three separate pie charts.
        *   **Code Cleanup (11:14:01 AM):** The previously commented-out code was removed, making the file cleaner without functional changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API-driven Frontend:** The application heavily relies on fetching data from a backend API, with numerous endpoints defined in `constants.js` and consumed by components like `ShareofVoice.jsx`.
*   **Modular Component Design:** Logic is separated into reusable components (e.g., `ShareofVoice.jsx` orchestrates data fetching and passes it to `PieChartSection.jsx` for rendering).
*   **State Management:** React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are extensively used for managing component state, especially for asynchronous data fetching and UI interactions like date range selection and filter application.
*   **Environment Variables:** Base URLs for API calls are configured via `process.env` variables, indicating a robust deployment strategy.
*   **Date Range Filtering:** A common pattern of filtering data by date range (Last 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, etc., and custom ranges) is implemented, including validation for start/end dates.
*   **Multi-Select Filtering:** The use of `MultiSelectDropdown` for `mediaTypeOptions` and `selectedCompetitors` indicates support for multiple selections in data filtering.
*   **Dashboard Development:** The changes are clearly part of developing or enhancing a "Brand Dashboard," focusing on analytics like "Share of Voice" and "Top Journalists."
