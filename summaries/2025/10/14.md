# Activity Summary for 10/14/2025

## 11:14:50 AM
The log details changes across two primary files: `src\constants.js` and `src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`, along with `src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\PieChartSection.jsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** Changes recorded between 10/14/2025, 10:16:39 AM and 10/14/2025, 10:34:16 AM.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** Active development occurred between 10/14/2025, 10:37:06 AM and 10/14/2025, 11:04:36 AM.
    *   **Content Changes:**
        *   **Initial state (10:37:06 AM):** The component sets up state variables for `timePeriod`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`, `topJournalistsData`, `topCompetitorJournalistsData`, `selectedCompetitors`, `shareOfVoiceData`, `competitors`, `selectedMediaTypes`, and `selectedMediaTypes2`. It initializes the date range to "Last 1 month" and fetches `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE`, `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS`, and `GET_TOP_COMETITOR_JOURNALIST` data via `useEffect` hooks. Date range calculation and input handling are implemented.
        *   **Incremental addition of `getShareOfVoiceMention` (10:38:54 AM - 10:41:19 AM):** An empty async function `getShareOfVoiceMention` was initially added, then gradually filled with a `try...catch` block, a `userService.post` call using `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE_MENTION`, and a `payload` object including `media: selectedMediaTypes2`.
        *   **State management for `shareOfVoiceMention` (10:43:10 AM - 10:44:00 AM):** A new state variable `shareOfVoiceMention` was introduced. The `getShareOfVoiceMention` function was updated to store the fetched data (`res?.data || []`) into this state upon a successful API response (`res?.response?.status === "Ok"`).
        *   **API call trigger (10:44:16 AM):** The `getShareOfVoiceMention()` call was added to the `useEffect` hook that already handles fetching top journalists, ensuring it triggers when `startDate`, `endDate`, `selectedCompetitors`, or `selectedMediaTypes2` change.
        *   **Prop pass to child component (11:04:36 AM):** The newly managed `shareOfVoiceMention` state was passed as a prop to the `PieChartSection` component.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\PieChartSection.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** Active development occurred between 10/14/2025, 11:12:14 AM and 10/14/2025, 11:14:01 AM.
    *   **Content Changes:**
        *   **Initial Static Chart (11:12:14 AM):** The component rendered a single pie chart using static data for series and labels. It received `shareOfVoiceMention` as a prop but didn't utilize it in the chart data.
        *   **Dynamic Charting and Refactoring (11:13:10 AM):** The component was significantly refactored. The old code was commented out (and later removed). The new implementation introduced three distinct pie chart configurations: `realDataConfig` for "Share of Voice by Mentions", `reachDataConfig` for "Share of Voice by Reach", and `averageDataConfig`. Crucially, the "Share of Voice by Mentions" chart (`realDataConfig`) was updated to dynamically use the `shareOfVoiceMention` prop for its `series` (using `item.count`) and `labels` (using `item.brand_name`). It also added a tooltip formatter to display percentages. The other two charts (`reachDataConfig`, `averageDataConfig`) continued to use dummy data. The component now maps over these configurations to render three separate pie charts.
        *   **Code Cleanup (11:14:01 AM):** The previously commented-out code was removed, making the file cleaner without functional changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API-driven Frontend:** The application heavily relies on fetching data from a backend API, with numerous endpoints defined in `constants.js` and consumed by components like `ShareofVoice.jsx`.
*   **Modular Component Design:** Logic is separated into reusable components (e.g., `ShareofVoice.jsx` orchestrates data fetching and passes it to `PieChartSection.jsx` for rendering).
*   **State Management:** React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are extensively used for managing component state, especially for asynchronous data fetching and UI interactions like date range selection and filter application.
*   **Environment Variables:** Base URLs for API calls are configured via `process.env` variables, indicating a robust deployment strategy.
*   **Date Range Filtering:** A common pattern of filtering data by date range (Last 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, etc., and custom ranges) is implemented, including validation for start/end dates.
*   **Multi-Select Filtering:** The use of `MultiSelectDropdown` for `mediaTypeOptions` and `selectedCompetitors` indicates support for multiple selections in data filtering.
*   **Dashboard Development:** The changes are clearly part of developing or enhancing a "Brand Dashboard," focusing on analytics like "Share of Voice" and "Top Journalists."

## 12:15:00 PM
The provided log details changes across three React components within a "Share of Voice" feature, all occurring on October 14, 2025.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\ShareofVoice.jsx`**
- **10/14/2025, 11:17:29 AM**: The component initializes as a comprehensive dashboard for "Share of Voice." It integrates multiple sub-components (`BrandHeader`, `MonthShareOfVoice`, `PieChartSection`, `TopJournalists`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`) and manages complex state for time periods, start/end dates, selected competitors, media types, and various data sets (top journalists, share of voice mentions, overall share of voice data). It includes logic to calculate date ranges and fetch data based on these filters.
- **10/14/2025, 11:40:47 AM - 11:49:37 AM**: A series of changes focused on the `h1` title of the "Brand Dashboard". Initially, an empty placeholder `{}` was introduced at 11:40:47 AM, then reverted to "Brand Dashboard" at 11:47:52 AM. Subsequently, the `useLocalStorage` hook was imported at 11:48:34 AM and then used to dynamically display a `brandName` retrieved from local storage, with "Brand Dashboard" as a fallback, finalized by 11:49:12 AM.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\PieChartSection.jsx`**
- **10/14/2025, 11:21:51 AM**: The component is introduced, rendering three pie charts ("Share of Voice by Mentions," "Share of Voice by Reach," "Average Share of Voice") using `react-apexcharts`. It supports dynamic loading and features `noData` configurations and tooltip formatting for the "Mentions" chart, which uses actual data, while the other two use dummy data.
- **10/14/2025, 11:24:19 AM**: A debugging `console.log` statement was removed.
- **10/14/2025, 11:37:25 AM - 11:40:07 AM**: A sequence of minor, iterative adjustments to the visual presentation of the pie charts. This involved modifying the `dataLabels.offset` property (e.g., from `-15` to `-10`) and `dataLabels.style.fontSize` (e.g., from `"12px"` to `"10px"`) for various chart configurations to refine label positioning and size. A redundant `dataLabels` offset configuration was also removed from `reachDataConfig` at 11:39:32 AM.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\ShareofVoice\TopJournalists.jsx`**
- **10/14/2025, 11:28:14 AM**: This component is initially created to display lists of "Top Journalists" for both the brand and its competitors. It enables users to select journalists, add them to a CRM (with quantity limits and account limits), or create a media list using a `BuildCampaign` popup. A nested `JournalistTable` component handles rendering the journalist data, including a placeholder image.
- **10/14/2025, 11:31:04 AM - 11:36:12 AM**: A series of updates address the handling of the journalist profile image.
    - At 11:31:04 AM, the image `src` was changed to an empty string, potentially causing broken image icons.
    - A faulty import for a `noUser` asset was attempted at 11:32:32 AM.
    - This import was corrected to a proper relative path at 11:34:05 AM, and the image `src` was updated to use this imported asset.
    - The import was temporarily commented out and the `src` reverted at 11:35:44 AM, then re-implemented correctly by 11:36:12 AM to use `noUser.src` for the image source.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Component-Based Architecture**: All changes occur within React functional components, utilizing `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for side effects like data fetching.
- **Data Fetching and API Interaction**: Components frequently make `POST` requests via `userService.post` to specific backend endpoints (e.g., `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE`, `GET_TOP_JOURNALISTS`, `PRECRM_POSTDATA`). Error handling with `try-catch` blocks and `console.error` is consistent.
- **User Interface Interactivity**: Components incorporate interactive elements such as dropdowns, multi-selects, date inputs, checkboxes, and buttons.
- **User Feedback**: The `useNotification` hook is widely used to provide feedback to the user, particularly for warnings and success messages.
- **Date Range Filtering**: The `ShareofVoice` component specifically implements logic for calculating and managing date ranges, supporting various predefined periods and custom selections.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes are extensively used across components for layout and visual presentation.
- **Data Visualization**: The `PieChartSection` demonstrates a focus on data visualization, using a dynamic import for `react-apexcharts` to render interactive charts.
- **Refinement and Bug Fixing**: Several changes, particularly in `PieChartSection.jsx` and `TopJournalists.jsx`, show iterative refinement of UI details (chart label positioning, image display) and correction of asset linking issues.
- **Local Storage Integration**: The `ShareofVoice` component integrates `useLocalStorage` to persist and retrieve UI-related information like the brand name.
