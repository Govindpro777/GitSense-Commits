# Activity Summary for 10/5/2025

## 2:38:21 PM
The provided log details changes within a Node.js backend project, primarily focusing on the implementation and documentation of a "Reels" feature, along with updates to the OpenAPI specification. All recorded changes occurred on **10/4/2025**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\routes\reelRoutes.js`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 10/4/2025, 10:48:07 PM**: This file was initially established to define API routes for managing "Reels" and "Reel Categories". It integrates `multer` for handling video uploads, specifying an `uploads/videos` directory for storage, a `videoFilter` to ensure only video files are accepted, and a `200MB` file size limit. Routes are segregated into public access (listing reels, listing by category, liking reels) and admin/superadmin operations (CRUD for categories and reels). Authentication and authorization middleware are consistently applied to administrative endpoints.
    *   **Subsequent Timestamps (10/4/2025, 10:49:50 PM and 11:08:11 PM)**: These entries show the entire code content being commented out and then immediately re-added (or simply the exact same content re-saved). This indicates no functional changes were introduced in these specific commits; they likely represent temporary debugging steps or routine saves rather than meaningful code modifications.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\docs\openapi.yaml`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 10/4/2025, 10:52:20 PM**: A comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification file was introduced. It details the API title, description, version, and support contact. It defines multiple server environments (development, production via `https://api.manmitr.com/api`, and local). Security is established using `BearerAuth` (JWT). Crucially, a wide array of schemas are defined for various entities, including `User`, `Post`, `MoodLog`, `FeelingToday`, `Psychologist`, `Appointment`, `Poll`, and extensive schemas for a `Questionnaire` system (Question, Questionnaire, Responses, Submission Requests). Additionally, schemas for `MusicCategory` and `Music` are present, alongside generic `ApiResponse` and `ErrorResponse` structures. The `/auth/signup` endpoint is partially documented, suggesting this is an ongoing effort to document the entire API.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\controllers\reelController.js`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 10/4/2025, 11:07:46 PM**: This file defines the `ReelController` class, implementing the business logic for the Reel feature. It includes asynchronous functions for:
        *   **Category Management**: `createCategory` (requires unique name, `createdBy` user), `updateCategory` (updates name or active status), and `deleteCategory` (deletes a category and all associated reels).
        *   **Reel Management**: `createReel` (requires title and video file, links to category, `createdBy`), `updateReel` (updates title, description, or video file), `deleteReel` (deletes a reel and its video file from storage), `listReels` (retrieves active reels, populated with category name), `listByCategory` (retrieves active reels for a specific category), and `likeReel` (increments a reel's like count).
        *   The controller utilizes `successResponse`, `errorResponse` utilities, and a `logger` for consistent feedback and error tracking.
    *   **Subsequent Timestamps (10/4/2025, 11:17:55 PM and 11:18:31 PM)**: The change at 11:17:55 PM is purely stylistic, changing double quotes to single quotes in string literals. The entry at 11:18:31 PM again shows the content being commented out and then re-added, but it's truncated at the end, indicating an incomplete or temporary commit, functionally restoring the stylistic changes from the previous entry.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Reels Feature Development**: The most prominent pattern is the active development of a "Reels" feature, encompassing both its routing and controller logic.
*   **Consistent File I/O for Uploads**: Both `reelRoutes.js` (Multer configuration) and `reelController.js` (file path handling, deletion) demonstrate consistent handling of video file uploads and their lifecycle.
*   **Role-Based Access Control**: Authentication and authorization middlewares are a recurring element, ensuring that only users with 'admin' or 'superadmin' roles can perform sensitive operations on reels and categories.
*   **Standardized API Responses and Logging**: The use of `successResponse`, `errorResponse`, and a `logger` across the controller indicates a structured approach to API feedback and debugging.
*   **OpenAPI Documentation**: The introduction of `openapi.yaml` signifies a commitment to comprehensive API documentation, providing a structured overview of the backend's capabilities and data models.
*   **"Comment-Out/Restore" Pattern**: A peculiar pattern of commenting out entire file contents and then restoring them immediately is observed in both `reelRoutes.js` and `reelController.js`, suggesting frequent saves, possibly IDE-driven autosaves or quick reverts during development, rather than functional modifications.
