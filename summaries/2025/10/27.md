The provided log details a significant update to the `Hero.jsx` component, located at `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\BeforeLogin\Landing\Hero.jsx`, timestamped October 27, 2025, at 10:18:13 AM.

This update introduces or refines the main landing page hero section. Key changes and characteristics include:

*   **Header Redesign**: The header now features a `Socion Logo` (image `/assets/logo.png`) and two prominent buttons for "Sign Up" (`/signup-pro`) and "Login" (`/login`). A previously existing "Get Early Access" button and a text-based "Socion" logo appear to be commented out, indicating design iteration or a shift in the primary call to action.
*   **Hero Content**: The main section highlights the value proposition: "Discover Influencers Before They Go Mainstream," supported by a description and a bulleted list of benefits ("Spot rising stars," "Evaluate fit and performance," "Works across Instagram, YouTube & more"). A "Get Started" button links directly to the login page.
*   **Visual Elements**: The component makes extensive use of images. A large background image (`/assets/social-bg.webp`) covers the section, and a grid of six distinct influencer-themed images (`/assets/social-1.webp` through `/assets/social-6.webp`) is displayed prominently, each with `rounded-[40px]` styling.
*   **Styling and Technology**: The component is built using Next.js (indicated by `import Link from "next/link"`) and leverages Tailwind CSS for styling. Recurring patterns include specific brand colors like a prominent red-orange (`#E96D70`) for buttons and text, a lighter background shade (`#F4BB3F33`), and consistent `rounded-lg` or `rounded-[40px]` styles for UI elements and images. Many elements use `max-w-7xl mx-auto` for consistent content width and centering.

## 11:15:12 AM
The `Header.jsx` file, timestamped 10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM, has undergone significant changes, primarily focused on enhancing user experience, tracking, and integration with various services.

**File-specific updates for `Header.jsx`:**

*   **Extensive Imports:** The component now imports a wide array of utilities, services, and components. This includes Next.js navigation hooks (`usePathname`, `next/link`), Redux for state management (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`), custom services (`auth.service`, `user.service`, `token.service`), and numerous custom UI components for features like toasts, session management, search, chat, tooltips, popups, error alerts, and signup steps.
*   **State Management:** Many new `useState` variables have been introduced to manage UI states (e.g., dropdown visibility, loading indicators, popup visibility, online status, mobile menu, user role, remaining freebie days). `useRef` is used for managing DOM element references, specifically for dropdowns.
*   **User and Session Management:**
    *   A `fetchTransferToken` function is implemented to securely fetch and use a token for integration with `SOCIALURL`.
    *   The `applogout` function now clears `localStorage`, removes a cookie via an API endpoint (`/api/remove-cookie`), and redirects the user to the homepage.
    *   It retrieves user `roleType` and checks for "Freebies" to trigger a `FreeDays` API call, which in turn can show a `showPopup` if `remaingDays` is 0.
*   **Tracking and Analytics:**
    *   A `postTracking` function sends detailed user interaction data (userId, pageName, clickId) to a `PostTracking` API endpoint. This function is invoked on every `pathname` change, indicating a robust system for monitoring user navigation.
    *   A new Google Analytics (GA) tracking block has been added, identified by the comment `[FOLLOWING GA TRACKING CODE GIVEN BY RAZI ON 06/02/2025 START]`. It initializes GA with `GA_TRACKING_ID = "G-L6REHKD7DC"` and tracks user identification (`userId`, `userName`). This is a major update indicating a new analytics initiative.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Includes logic to handle online/offline status, updating the UI if the user's internet connection changes.
    *   Dropdowns for "social" and "campaign" are managed with `outSide` click detection for closing.
    *   An `stripAnnouncement` function fetches and displays active announcements, likely for banners or notifications.
    *   The `mainNav` array defines navigation links, with current active links for "Home" (`/dashboard`) and "MyCRM" (`/mycrm`), while many other navigation items (e.g., "Brand", "Social" with X, Instagram, Podcast, "Campaigns") are commented out, suggesting potential future features or past iterations.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Logic for `loginStatus` and `shouldRender` is included, related to dynamically showing a "GO To SOCION" button based on login status.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API-centric development:** The component frequently interacts with various backend APIs (`userService.post`, `userService.get`) for fetching data (e.g., transfer tokens, freebies days, announcements) and sending data (e.g., tracking data, logout).
*   **Heavy use of React Hooks:** `useState` and `useEffect` are extensively used to manage component state, side effects, and lifecycle events.
*   **Modular design:** The component imports many smaller, specialized components (e.g., `Tooltip`, `Searchbar`, `ErrorToast`), suggesting a modular approach to UI development.
*   **Commented-out code:** Several sections of code, including navigation items and an `useEffect` for clearing `localStorage` on `beforeunload`, are commented out. This could indicate features under development, experimental code, or deprecated functionalities that have been preserved for reference.
*   **Constants:** Relies heavily on imported constants (e.g., `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `SOCIALURL`) for API endpoints and configuration values, promoting maintainability.

The `.env` files were not summarized as per the instructions, as they typically contain sensitive configuration and environment variables.

    *   The body content explicitly states that Socion trial data will be "archived permanently in the next few days" and that users will "lose your saved work and setups." It strongly urges reactivation with the "30-day money-back guarantee" to ensure "Immediate access to your existing data." The call to action is "Reactivate Now."

6.  **`Weekly_Nurture.html`**:
    *   This file was introduced at **11:41:19 AM** for weekly engagement.
    *   Its header CTA, initially inheriting text about data archiving, was quickly changed through several iterations between **11:41:32 AM and 11:43:51 AM** to a more fitting message: "How PR teams achieve more with Socion." The highlighted text's font weight was set to `700` at **11:43:30 AM**.
    *   The body content outlines that the email will share "stories, insights, and quick wins" about Socion, including a user story, feature highlight on "Real-time media alerts," and an FAQ about the money-back guarantee. The button is "Upgrade Now."

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HTML Email Structure:** All files adhere to a consistent HTML email template structure, utilizing tables for layout, inline CSS for styling, external Google Fonts (`Inter`, `Source Sans 3`), and incorporating a top banner image (`bg-header-socion.png`) and Socion logo (`socion-logo2.png`).
*   **Brand Consistency:** The "Socion" logo, "Team Socion" sign-off, and social media links (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X/Twitter) are present in all emails, reinforcing brand identity. "Powered by: skribe" also appears consistently.
*   **Trial & Money-Back Guarantee:** A central theme across all templates is the promotion of a "30-day money-back guarantee" or "zero risk" offer for Socion, aiming to convert trial users or attract new ones.
*   **Header CTA Evolution:** The most frequently modified element across all files is the main header Call-to-Action (CTA) box. It undergoes continuous refinement in wording, line breaks, font size, and font weight (especially for highlighted yellow text, typically using `#FFE55C` color) to optimize its impact.
*   **Targeted Messaging:** While the underlying structure is similar, the body content clearly diverges to target different user segments:
    *   **Existing Users (Trial Ended):** Emails like `Don’t_Lose_Your_Work_Existing_Users_30 Oct.html` and `Final_Call_Existing_Users_6Nov.html` focus on the urgency of reactivation to prevent data loss.
    *   **New Leads:** `Launch_Offer_New_Leads_27Oct.html` introduces Socion's benefits from scratch.
    *   **General/Nurture:** `30_Day_Safety_Net_1_Nov.html` offers a broader overview, and `Weekly_Nurture.html` focuses on ongoing engagement and feature highlights.
*   **Consistent Styling for Highlights:** Key phrases in the email body are consistently highlighted using `color: #02BD6D; font-weight: 600;`.
*   **Standard CTA Button:** All primary call-to-action buttons share similar styling (red background `#E23A27`, white text, rounded corners, box-shadow) and link to the same signup URL (`https://www.socion.in/signup-pro`), although the button text varies (e.g., "Activate Plan," "Start Now," "Continue Account," "Reactivate Now," "Upgrade Now").

In summary, the log illustrates a concentrated effort to rapidly develop and refine a suite of HTML email marketing templates for Socion, tailoring messages for different stages of the user journey (new leads, existing trial users, final reminders, weekly nurturing) while maintaining a consistent visual brand and a central "risk-free" offer. The numerous timestamped changes on a single day indicate an agile and iterative development process for these critical communication assets.

## 12:14:39 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\BeforeLogin\Landing\Hero.jsx`, last updated on 10/27/2025 at 10:18:13 AM, defines a `HeroPage` React component. This component functions as the main hero section for a landing page, built using Next.js for navigation and extensively styled with Tailwind CSS.

**Key updates and characteristics of this file include:**

*   **Structure and Content:** It presents a bold headline "Discover Influencers Before They Go Mainstream," accompanied by a descriptive paragraph and a bulleted list highlighting benefits like "Spot rising stars before they go viral."
*   **Visual Elements:** The component uses a `social-bg.webp` as a full-width background, displays a `logo.png`, and features a dynamic grid of six distinct influencer-themed images (`social-1.webp` through `social-6.webp`), all with `rounded-[40px]` corners.
*   **Navigation and Calls to Action:** It integrates `next/link` components for user interaction, providing "Sign Up," "Login," and a "Get Started" button in the hero section, all directing to `/signup-pro` or `/login` routes.
*   **Styling Patterns:** There's a consistent application of Tailwind CSS classes, frequently using specific hex colors such as `#E96D70` for primary button backgrounds and text (with a hover effect changing to `#ff4f4f`), and `#F4BB3F33` for section backgrounds. Image elements and buttons consistently feature rounded corners. Text sizes are responsively scaled using `md:` and `lg:` prefixes.
*   **Commented Code:** The presence of commented-out code suggests previous iterations included a text-based "Socion" logo and a "Get Early Access" button linked to a `scrollToCTA` prop, indicating a shift towards the current image-based logo and direct sign-up/login buttons.

## 12:15:14 PM
The `skribefrontend\src\components\Header\Header.jsx` file, last modified on `10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM`, details a comprehensive React header component (`Header.jsx`) for a Next.js application, utilizing `React.memo` for optimization.

**Key updates and functionalities in `Header.jsx`:**

*   **Core UI and Navigation:** It serves as a central navigation and user interface element, importing various components for search, chat (`TawkMessenger`), tooltips (`Tooltip`, `LockTooltip`, `HeaderLock`), popups (`CreatePopup`, `SelectPopup`, `SignupStep`), and error alerts (`ErrorToast`, `ErrorAlerts`).
*   **State Management:** The component manages numerous local states using `useState`, including user-related data (`tempToken`, `roleType`, `remaingDays`, `loginStatus`), UI visibility (`socialDropDown`, `campaignDropDown`, `showSelectPopup`, `mobileMenu`), loading indicators (`loading`, `stripLoading`), and online status (`isOnline`). It also integrates with Redux via `useDispatch` and `useSelector`.
*   **User Session and Authentication:** It handles user logout by clearing `localStorage` and making an API call (`Authenticate/logout`), followed by removing cookies and redirecting to the home page. It checks for user information in `localStorage` and displays a `SessionOut` component.
*   **Feature Integrations:**
    *   **Freebies/Subscription:** Fetches remaining free days via an API (`FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`) and triggers a popup (`showPopup`) if no days are left, suggesting a paywall or upgrade prompt.
    *   **Social Platform Integration:** Includes functionality to `fetchTransferToken` which then opens a new window to a "Socion" URL (`SOCIALURL`) with a generated token.
    *   **Announcements:** Fetches and displays active announcements from an API (`ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT`).
    *   **Online Status:** Monitors the browser's online/offline status.
*   **Navigation:** Defines primary navigation links (`Home`, `MyCRM`). Several commented-out navigation items for "Brand", "Social" (X, Instagram, Podcast), and "Campaigns" (Create Campaign, Campaign Tracker, Media Lists, Top Journalists, Campaign Manager) indicate potential or past features. The component uses `next/link` for navigation and `usePathname` for routing awareness.
*   **User Tracking and Analytics:**
    *   **Internal Tracking:** Implements a `postTracking` function that sends user interaction data (userId, pageName, clickId) to a `PostTracking` API endpoint, triggered on URL pathname changes.
    *   **Google Analytics:** Initializes Google Analytics (`G-L6REHKD7DC`) using `useEffect`, sending user ID and agency name from `localStorage` as user properties. This integration is explicitly noted as implemented on `06/02/2025`.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Manages dropdown visibility using `useRef` and an `outSide` click handler to close them when clicked outside.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **`useEffect` and `useState` Hooks:** Extensively used throughout the component for managing component lifecycle, side effects, and local state.
*   **`localStorage` Dependency:** Frequent reliance on `localStorage` for storing user information, session details, and UI preferences.
*   **API Interactions:** Numerous calls to `userService` and `auth.service` for various data fetching and authentication operations.
*   **Conditional Logic:** Logic often depends on user `roleType` (e.g., "Freebies" role) to control feature access.
*   **External Service Integrations:** Consistent pattern of integrating with external services like Tawk.to Messenger, Google Analytics, and a "Socion" platform.
*   **Commented Code:** The presence of commented-out code suggests historical features, alternative implementations (e.g., `react-router-dom` vs. `next/navigation`), or features under development.
*   **Emphasis on Tracking:** Both custom and third-party tracking (Google Analytics) are prominent, indicating a strong focus on understanding user behavior.

## 1:00:48 PM
The provided log details a series of rapid updates to several HTML email templates, all occurring on October 27, 2025, between 11:18:37 AM and 11:47:53 AM. The changes primarily involve refining the textual content within prominent banner sections and creating new, distinct email campaigns from a common base template.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Other Emails\Launch_offer_27Oct.html`**: This file underwent numerous minor textual adjustments to its top promotional banner. Initially, the banner stated "We’re giving you a 30-day safety net" (11:18:37 AM). It was then iteratively modified through phrases like "Keep your workflow running with zero risk." (11:19:04 AM), a shorter "Keep your 30-day safety net" (11:19:41 AM), and several combinations before settling on "Keep your <br> workflow running <br> with zero risk." by 11:25:44 AM. The body content, which addresses users whose Socion trial may have ended and offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, remained largely consistent.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Other Emails\Launch_Offer_New_Leads_27Oct.html`**: Introduced at 11:28:50 AM, this file targets new leads. Its body content differs significantly from the previous file, introducing Socion's features (real-time monitoring, custom alerts, analytics, reporting) and offering a "Start Now" call to action with a 30-day money-back guarantee. A minor styling change at 11:47:53 AM adjusted the `font-size` of the highlighted text in the banner from 24px to 22px and set its `font-weight` to 700.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Other Emails\Don’t_Lose_Your_Work_Existing_Users_30 Oct.html`**: Created at 11:35:44 AM, this email is aimed at existing users with expired trials, urging them to reactivate to prevent data archiving. The banner text saw quick revisions between 11:36:11 AM and 11:36:23 AM, evolving from "Keep your workflow running with zero risk." to "Your Socion <br> setup’s still here <br> don’t lose it." A styling change at 11:46:56 AM reduced the highlighted text's font size to 22px and set `font-weight` to 700.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Other Emails\30_Day_Safety_Net_1_Nov.html`**: This file, created at 11:37:50 AM, promotes Socion's benefits for PR teams and its risk-free 30-day trial. Its banner message was refined through several iterations (11:38:09 AM - 11:38:29 AM), starting with "Your Socion setup’s still here don’t lose it." and finally settling on "Experience effortless <br> reporting with Socion <br> risk-free." A font size reduction and font-weight adjustment were applied to the highlighted banner text at 11:46:26 AM.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Other Emails\Final_Call_Existing_Users_6Nov.html`**: This "final reminder" email, created at 11:39:18 AM, emphasizes the impending permanent archiving of trial data for existing users. The banner text was heavily revised between 11:39:44 AM and 11:40:07 AM to clearly convey the urgency, concluding with "Your data will be <br> archived soon act <br> now to keep it live." The highlighted text's font size was adjusted to 22px and `font-weight` to 700 at 11:44:45 AM.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Other Emails\Weekly_Nurture.html`**: This file, created at 11:41:19 AM, is a weekly nurture email providing "stories, insights, and quick wins" about Socion features and user success. The banner message saw significant corrections and refinements across multiple timestamps (11:41:32 AM - 11:43:04 AM). It initially contained a misplaced "Your data will be archived soon..." message, which was corrected to "How PR teams <br> achieve more with <br> Socion." The highlighted text was adjusted to "achieve more". At 11:43:30 AM, the `font-weight` of the highlighted banner text was changed from 800 to 700.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The log shows a concentrated burst of activity on **October 27, 2025**, with almost continuous updates from 11:18 AM to 11:47 AM. Most changes involved minor textual edits, particularly to the main promotional banner within each email template.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Common Template Structure:** All emails share an identical HTML boilerplate, including meta tags, external Google Fonts (`Inter`, `Source Sans 3`), basic body styles, and a fixed-width table layout for the email content.
*   **Consistent Branding:** Each email features the "Socion Logo" and a "woman with laptop illustration" image in the header, along with a "Powered by: skribe" footer and consistent social media links (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X) pointing to "goskribe" profiles.
*   **"Free Trial Ending Soon" Title:** Interestingly, the `<title>` tag consistently displays "Free Trial Ending Soon" across all distinct email files, regardless of their specific campaign purpose (e.g., launch offer, new leads, weekly nurture). This suggests a generic default title or a thematic collection of emails related to trial management.
*   **30-Day Money-Back Guarantee:** The "30-day money-back guarantee" and "risk-free" offers are a prominent and recurring selling point across all email types, frequently highlighted in both banner text and body paragraphs.
*   **Call to Action Consistency:** The primary call-to-action buttons across all emails maintain a consistent style (red background, white text, rounded corners, shadow) and uniformly link to `https://www.socion.in/signup-pro`.
*   **Iterative Banner Refinements:** A notable pattern is the iterative and rapid modification of the top banner's headline text within minutes for each file, indicating a focused effort to optimize messaging and calls to action. These changes often involved rephrasing, re-breaking lines, and adjusting the highlighted (yellow) portion of the text for impact.
*   **Targeted Content:** While sharing a template, the body content is tailored for specific user segments (existing trial users, new leads) and email types (promotional, urgent reminder, nurture).

## 1:14:36 PM
The `Hero.jsx` file, timestamped 10/27/2025, 10:18:13 AM, defines the main hero section for a "Before Login" landing page.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **Header:** The component features a header with a "Socion Logo" (`/assets/logo.png`) and navigation buttons. Significantly, a `Get Early Access` button and a simple text logo (`Socion`) have been commented out, indicating a shift towards direct "Sign Up" (linking to `/signup-pro`) and "Login" (linking to `/login`) options.
*   **Main Content:** The hero section includes a prominent headline: "Discover Influencers Before They Go Mainstream," supported by a descriptive paragraph and a bulleted list of benefits (spotting rising stars, evaluating fit, cross-platform support). A "Get Started" button also directs users to the `/login` page.
*   **Visuals:** A strong emphasis is placed on visual elements. The background is an image (`/assets/social-bg.webp`), and the right side of the hero section is filled with a grid of six distinct influencer images (`/assets/social-1.webp` through `social-6.webp`), arranged in two rows, each with varied dimensions and rounded corners.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Navigation:** The use of `next/link` is consistent for all call-to-action buttons, directing users to `/signup-pro` or `/login`.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS classes are heavily utilized throughout the component for layout, responsive design (e.g., `md:text`, `lg:px`), and a consistent color palette, notably using `#E96D70` for primary actions and text, and `bg-[#F4BB3F33]` for background elements.
*   **Asset Usage:** Multiple `.webp` image assets are loaded from the `/assets` directory for both background and content visuals, suggesting a strategy to optimize image loading and visual appeal.

## 1:15:11 PM
The `Header.jsx` file, timestamped 10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM, underwent significant updates. This React component now includes a "use client" directive, indicating client-side rendering, and makes extensive use of Next.js features like `Link` and `usePathname`.

Key changes in `Header.jsx` involve:
*   **Imports and Dependencies:** A wide array of React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`), Redux (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`), custom components (`ErrorToast`, `SessionOut`, `Searchbar`, `TawkMessenger`, various Tooltip components, `MorePower`, `CreatePopup`, `ErrorAlerts`, `SelectPopup`, `SignupStep`), and services (`auth.service`, `user.service`, `token.service`) have been imported. Constants such as `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT`, `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `SOCIALURL`, and `USERINFO` are prominently used.
*   **State Management:** The component manages various states including `tempToken`, `loading`, `error`, dropdown visibility (`socialDropDown`, `campaignDropDown`), announcement strip status (`stripLoading`, `stripData`, `showNotifications`), popup visibility (`showSelectPopup`, `isSelectPopupOpen`), online status (`isOnline`), mobile menu state (`mobileMenu`), user role (`roleType`), remaining freebie days (`remaingDays`), and login status for conditional rendering (`loginStatus`, `shouldRender`). `showNotifications` is initialized from `localStorage`.
*   **Core Functionalities:**
    *   **User Role and Freebies:** It fetches `roleType` on mount and, if the user is a "Freebies" type, fetches `remaingDays`. A popup is triggered if `remaingDays` reaches zero.
    *   **Session and Online Status:** An `useEffect` hook monitors the browser's online/offline status, updating the `isOnline` state.
    *   **Social Integration:** The `fetchTransferToken` function is responsible for fetching a temporary token and redirecting the user to `SOCIALURL`.
    *   **Announcements:** The `stripAnnouncement` function fetches and displays active announcements via `ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT`.
    *   **Logout Mechanism:** The `applogout` function clears `localStorage`, calls an authentication service logout, removes a cookie, and redirects to the homepage.
    *   **Dropdown Control:** `useRef` is employed with an `outSide` event listener to close dropdowns when clicks occur outside their boundaries.
    *   **Tracking and Analytics:** A new `postTracking` function sends detailed user and page interaction data (userId, pageName, clickId) to a `PostTracking` API endpoint whenever the `pathname` changes. Additionally, there's a Google Analytics (GA) tracking integration (identified by `GA_TRACKING_ID: G-L6REHKD7DC`) that initializes GA and sends user details.
*   **Navigation Structure:** The `mainNav` array defines primary navigation links ("Home" and "MyCRM"). Several other navigation items (e.g., "Brand", "Social" with sub-items for X, Instagram, Podcast; "Campaigns" with Create, Tracker, Media Lists sub-items; "Top Journalists") are commented out, suggesting planned or previously implemented features.
*   **Performance:** The component is wrapped in `React.memo` for optimization.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
There's a consistent pattern of using `useEffect` for side effects, data fetching, and event listeners. State management often involves `useState` and `useRef` for UI interactions (e.g., dropdowns). `localStorage` is frequently accessed for user data and state persistence. Error handling and loading states (`setLoading`, `setError`) are implemented for API calls, which are generally wrapped in `try...catch...finally` blocks. The presence of numerous commented-out code blocks, especially in navigation definitions and `useEffect`s, indicates ongoing development or a history of feature changes.

The provided log details a series of iterative changes made to several HTML email templates, all occurring on October 27, 2025, within a concentrated timeframe between 11:18 AM and 11:48 AM. The core purpose of these emails appears to be user acquisition, trial conversion, and re-engagement for a product named "Socion" by "skribe," emphasizing a "30-day money-back guarantee" or "zero risk" offer.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Changes:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Other Emails\Launch_offer_27Oct.html`**:
    *   **10/27/2025, 11:18:37 AM**: The initial version of this email, titled "Free Trial Ending Soon", offers a "30-day safety net" in its prominent red header banner.

The initial header banner matched the then-current "Your data will be archived soon act now to keep it live." from the "Final\_Call" email.
    *   **10/27/2025, 11:41:32 AM - 11:43:04 AM**: The header banner underwent significant revisions to "How PR teams achieve more with Socion." with various line break and highlighting adjustments within that phrase.
    *   **10/27/2025, 11:43:30 AM - 11:43:51 AM**: The font weight of the highlighted text in the banner was changed from `800` to `700`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Structure and Branding**: All HTML files adhere to a similar email template structure, featuring a top banner with a background image (`bg-header-socion.png`), a "Socion Logo" (socion-logo2.png), a "woman with laptop illustration" (socion-girl.png), and a footer with social media links and a "Powered by: skribe" attribution.
*   **"30-day money-back guarantee" / "Zero Risk"**: This is a prominent and consistently highlighted selling point across all email types, appearing in both the header banner (often with yellow styling) and the body text.
*   **Header Banner Focus**: The most frequent and detailed changes across all templates relate to the text content and styling within the main header banner, indicating an ongoing effort to optimize the primary attention-grabbing message. These changes include rephrasing, adjusting line breaks, and modifying font sizes/weights.
*   **Call to Action Consistency**: The primary call-to-action button consistently links to `https://www.socion.in/signup-pro` and maintains a visually distinct red background (`#E23A27`).
*   **Fixed Title Tag**: The `<title>` tag for all files remains unchanged as "Free Trial Ending Soon", regardless of the email's specific purpose (e.g., launch offer for new leads, weekly nurture). This suggests a common base template that wasn't fully customized for each email's unique context.
*   **Inter Font**: All templates specify "Inter", sans-serif as the primary font.
*   **Timestamp Pattern**: All modifications occurred on the same date (10/27/2025), clustered within an hour (11:18 AM to 11:48 AM), suggesting a dedicated session for fine-tuning these email assets.

## 2:07:26 PM
The log captures two closely timed entries for the file `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\src\pages\Report.jsx` at `10/27/2025, 1:26:04 PM` and `10/27/2025, 1:26:11 PM`.

The key information is that at both timestamps, the file contains an extensive, yet entirely commented-out, React functional component named `Report`.

File-specific updates:
*   The `Report.jsx` file is structured to be a detailed report management page.
*   It includes a wide array of `lucide-react` icon imports, suggesting a rich user interface for data visualization and interaction.
*   The commented code defines multiple React state variables for managing report data (`reports`, `filteredReports`), UI state (`loading`, `searchText`, `filterCategory`, `filterStatus`), and pagination (`currentPage`, `itemsPerPage`).
*   A `mockReports` array is present, detailing various report types (e.g., Sales, Customer Analytics, Inventory, Financial, HR, Marketing) with attributes like ID, name, category, status, dates, size, and downloads.
*   Functions are outlined for data loading (`loadReports`), applying filters and sorting (`applyFiltersAndSort` based on search text, category, and status, and sorting by `createdDate`), and calculating summary metrics (total, completed, processing, failed reports, total downloads).
*   Utility functions (`getStatusColor`, `getStatusIcon`, `getCategoryIcon`, `getFormatIcon`) are defined to provide dynamic styling and icons based on report properties.
*   Pagination logic is implemented to display reports in chunks.
*   The JSX structure indicates a layout with "Report Summary Cards" in a grid, implying dashboard-like metrics.

Timestamp of significant changes:
No functional code changes are observed between the two timestamps provided. Both entries show the identical, commented-out content. This indicates that a substantial amount of report-related functionality was present in a dormant (commented-out) state during this time window, or it was added and immediately commented out around `10/27/2025, 1:26:04 PM`.

Patterns or recurring elements:
*   Extensive use of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for component state management and side effects.
*   Conditional rendering and styling are implied through helper functions (`getStatusColor`, `getStatusIcon`, etc.) for different report statuses and categories.
*   The component demonstrates a clear separation of concerns for data fetching (mocked), filtering, sorting, and pagination.
*   A strong emphasis on UI presentation with dynamic icons and styling using a library like `lucide-react`.

## 2:14:36 PM
The `Hero.jsx` file, timestamped `10/27/2025, 10:18:13 AM`, defines the main hero section for a "BeforeLogin" landing page.

Key updates and patterns in this file include:

*   **File-Specific Updates**:
    *   The component, `HeroPage`, provides a visual and textual introduction, encouraging user engagement with "Socion".
    *   It features a prominent header with a logo (`/assets/logo.png`) and navigation buttons for "Sign Up" (linking to `/signup-pro`) and "Login" (linking to `/login`).
    *   The main content highlights the value proposition: "Discover Influencers Before They Go Mainstream," supported by a description and a list of benefits (spotting rising stars, evaluating fit, multi-platform support).
    *   A "Get Started" call-to-action button links to the `/login` page.
    *   The right side of the hero section is dedicated to a visually engaging grid of six distinct influencer-related images (`/assets/social-3.webp` through `/assets/social-6.webp`), laid out in two rows with varying dimensions and `rounded-[40px]` styling.
    *   A large background image (`/assets/social-bg.webp`) sets the overall aesthetic.

*   **Timestamps of Significant Changes**:
    *   The single provided timestamp, `10/27/2025, 10:18:13 AM`, indicates a specific point in time when the current structure and content of this Hero component were established or last modified.

*   **Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
    *   **Next.js Integration**: Uses `next/link` for client-side navigation.
    *   **Tailwind CSS**: Extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes for layout, typography, spacing, and responsive design (e.g., `max-w-7xl mx-auto`, `md:text-[35px]`, `lg:grid-cols-2`).
    *   **Branding & Color Palette**: Consistent use of specific brand colors, notably `#E96D70` for primary actions (buttons, borders) and hover effects (`hover:bg-[#ff4f4f]`). The background uses `bg-[#F4BB3F33]`.
    *   **Local Asset Management**: All images (background, logo, influencer photos) are sourced from the local `/assets` directory.
    *   **Call-to-Action Focus**: Multiple calls to action ("Sign Up," "Login," "Get Started") guide users towards registration or login.
    *   **Commented-out Code**: Presence of commented-out code for a "Get Early Access" button and an alternative logo text (`<div className="text-2xl font-bold">Socion</div>`) suggests evolution in design or functionality, indicating that "Sign Up" and "Login" are the current preferred entry points.

## 2:15:17 PM
**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Header\Header.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM
    *   This file, a core `Header` component, received significant updates. It leverages Next.js hooks like `usePathname` for navigation and integrates `react-redux` for state management.
    *   The component manages a multitude of UI states, including dropdown visibility, loading indicators, notification displays, online status, user role (`roleType`), remaining free trial days, and login status.
    *   It now includes logic for fetching and managing a `tempToken` for social redirects (`fetchTransferToken`), handling user logout (`applogout`) which clears local storage and calls an API to remove cookies.
    *   A new feature `FreeDays` checks for remaining freebies days based on the user's role and triggers a `showPopup` when days are exhausted.
    *   User behavior tracking (`postTracking`) has been implemented, sending `userId`, `pageName`, and `clickId` to a `PostTracking` API endpoint. This tracking is executed on every `pathname` change.
    *   An active announcement strip (`stripAnnouncement`) fetches data from the `ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT` API to display messages to users.
    *   Crucially, Google Analytics (GA_TRACKING_ID: G-L6REHKD7DC) integration was added, explicitly dated 06/02/2025 within the code comments. It initializes GA with user `name` and `agencyName` from `localStorage` as user identification.
    *   The navigation structure is present, defining "Home" and "MyCRM" links, with several commented-out sections for "Brand", "Social" (X, Instagram, Podcast), and "Campaigns" related features, indicating ongoing or paused development for these areas.
    *   The component also handles online/offline status detection, dynamic rendering based on login status, and external click handling to close dropdowns.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   The `Header.jsx` file was last extensively modified on **10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM**, incorporating a wide range of features and state management.
*   An internal comment within `Header.jsx` explicitly dates the Google Analytics tracking code implementation to **06/02/2025**, indicating a specific feature addition around that time.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive use of `localStorage`:** User information (`userInfo`), session status, and other application-specific flags (e.g., "strip" for notifications) are frequently stored and retrieved from `localStorage`.
*   **API Interaction Patterns:** A consistent pattern of calling `userService` methods (`get`, `post`) for various functionalities (e.g., `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT`, `PostTracking`, `Authenticate/logout`). These API calls often include `setLoading(true)` and `setLoading(false)` for UI feedback and `setError` for error handling.
*   **`useEffect` for Side Effects:** Numerous `useEffect` hooks are employed to handle component lifecycle events, data fetching, event listeners (online/offline, click outside), and tracking, often including cleanup functions.
*   **UI State Management:** There's a high density of `useState` hooks to manage various UI elements' visibility, loading states, and data, indicating a highly interactive and dynamic user interface.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Logic often depends on user roles (`roleType`) or specific conditions (e.g., `remaingDays === 0`) to render different UI elements or trigger actions.
*   **Commented-out Code:** Several sections of the code, particularly in the navigation (`mainNav`) array, are commented out, suggesting features that are planned, under development, or temporarily disabled.
*   **External Service Integration:** The presence of `TawkMessenger` for chat and the `SOCIALURL` constant (for `window.open` calls) indicates integration with third-party and other internal services.

## 3:07:34 PM
The log details changes across two React component files: `src\pages\Report.jsx` and `src\pages\Finance.jsx`, occurring on October 27, 2025.

**Summary of Changes:**

**`src\pages\Report.jsx`**
- **Timestamps:** 10/27/2025, 1:26:04 PM; 10/27/2025, 1:26:11 PM; 10/27/2025, 2:39:45 PM; 10/27/2025, 2:46:12 PM
- **Key Updates:** The file consistently contained a fully commented-out React component (`Report`) throughout the earlier timestamps. The significant change occurred at **2:46:12 PM**, when the entire component was uncommented, effectively activating it.
- **Content:** The `Report` component is designed to manage and display various reports. It utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` for state management, including `reports`, `filteredReports`, `loading`, `searchText`, `filterCategory`, `filterStatus`, `currentPage`, and `itemsPerPage`. It features mock report data with details like `id`, `name`, `category`, `status`, `type`, `generatedBy`, `createdDate`, `size`, `downloads`, and `format`. Functionality includes loading reports, applying filters (search, category, status), sorting reports by creation date, and pagination. It calculates key metrics such as total, completed, processing, and failed reports, and total downloads. The component also includes helper functions (`getStatusColor`, `getStatusIcon`, `getCategoryIcon`, `getFormatIcon`) to dynamically apply Tailwind CSS styling and `lucide-react` icons based on report attributes. Some `lucide-react` imports (`Calendar`, `Filter`, `ChevronDown`, `TrendingDown`) that were present in the commented block were removed in the active version, indicating refinement of icon usage.

**`src\pages\Finance.jsx`**
- **Timestamps:** 10/27/2025, 2:44:39 PM; 10/27/2025, 2:45:24 PM
- **Key Updates:** Initially, at 2:44:39 PM, this file contained a fully commented-out React component (`Finance`). A minute later, at **2:45:24 PM**, the entire component was uncommented, making it active.
- **Content:** The `Finance` component is built to manage and display financial transactions. It uses `useState` and `useEffect` for managing `transactions`, `filteredTransactions`, `loading`, `searchText`, `filterType`, `filterStatus`, `currentPage`, and `itemsPerPage`. It includes mock financial transaction data, detailing `id`, `type`, `category`, `description`, `amount`, `status`, `date`, `paymentMethod`, and `reference`. Core functionality covers loading transactions, applying filters (search, type, status), sorting transactions by date, and pagination. It computes crucial financial metrics like total income, total expenses, net profit, and pending amount, as well as counts for completed and pending transactions. Similar to `Report.jsx`, it provides helper functions (`getTypeColor`, `getTypeIcon`, `getStatusColor`) for dynamic Tailwind CSS styling and `lucide-react` icons based on transaction types and statuses.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Activation of Components:** Both `Report.jsx` and `Finance.jsx` underwent a rapid transition from being entirely commented out to fully uncommented within a short timeframe (around 2:45 PM - 2:46 PM on 10/27/2025), suggesting a development phase where components were prepared or temporarily disabled before being brought online.
- **React Component Structure:** Both files define functional React components, utilizing `useState` for local state and `useEffect` for side effects, data loading, and filter application.
- **Mock Data:** Both components use predefined mock data (reports and transactions) for development or demonstration purposes.
- **Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination:** A consistent pattern of client-side data management is observed, including search functionality, filtering by multiple criteria (category/type, status), sorting by date, and pagination to manage data display.
- **UI/UX Elements:** Both components feature "summary cards" at the top of their respective UIs, displaying key metrics. They extensively use `lucide-react` for icons and Tailwind CSS for styling, with dynamic styling functions that apply specific colors and icons based on data attributes.
- **Styling Consistency:** Specific brand colors, `#293a90` (dark blue) and `#eb0082` (pink/red), are used consistently across both files for icons and text, indicating a unified design language.

## 3:15:16 PM
The `Header.jsx` file underwent significant updates on **10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM**.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Header\Header.jsx`**

This file, representing the application's header component, received extensive updates focusing on user experience, data tracking, and dynamic content. Key changes include:

*   **Framework Integration:** Transitioned to using Next.js specific features like `next/link` and `usePathname` for navigation, while still retaining `react-redux` and custom context providers (`usePopup`, `useNotification`).
*   **State Management & UI Control:** Introduced numerous `useState` and `useRef` hooks to manage various UI states such as dropdowns (`socialDropDown`, `campaignDropDown`), loading indicators (`loading`, `stripLoading`), popup visibility (`showSelectPopup`, `isOpen`, `isSelectPopupOpen`), mobile menu status, and network connectivity (`isOnline`).
*   **Session and Role Management:** Tracks user login status (`loginStatus`) and `roleType` (e.g., "Freebies") from `tokenService`. It features a mechanism to display remaining freebie days (`remaingDays`) and trigger a popup when days are zero.
*   **API Integrations:** Incorporated multiple asynchronous API calls:
    *   `fetchTransferToken`: To handle token transfers, likely for single sign-on or integration with other platforms like Socion.
    *   `FreeDays`: To fetch information about remaining freebies.
    *   `stripAnnouncement`: To retrieve and display active announcements in a banner.
    *   `applogout`: A comprehensive logout function that clears local storage, removes specific cookies, calls a logout API, and redirects the user.
*   **User Activity Tracking:** A `postTracking` function was implemented to send user interaction data (userId, pageName, clickId) to a tracking API, triggered on `pathname` changes.
*   **Google Analytics (GA) Integration:** A notable addition is the inclusion of Google Analytics tracking code (`GA_TRACKING_ID = "G-L6REHKD7DC"`), explicitly noted in comments as given on **06/02/2025**. This suggests a focus on analytics and user behavior monitoring.
*   **Navigation & Content:** The `mainNav` structure was updated, currently featuring "Home" and "MyCRM", with several other potential navigation links (e.g., "Brand", "Social", "Campaigns", "Top Journalists") commented out, indicating either planned features or previous implementations.
*   **Performance:** The component is wrapped in `React.memo`, suggesting an optimization effort to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Use of Constants:** The component heavily relies on imported constants (e.g., `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT`, `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `SOCIALURL`, `USERINFO`) for API endpoints and application-specific values, promoting maintainability.
*   **API Service Layer:** Consistent use of `userService` for interacting with various backend endpoints, indicating a structured approach to API communication.
*   **Local Storage for User Data:** `localStorage` is frequently accessed to retrieve `userInfo` and manage temporary flags or statuses.
*   **Event Listeners for UI Interactions:** Both `window` and specific `useRef` elements are used with event listeners (`click`, `online`, `offline`) to manage global and element-specific interactions like dropdown closing and network status.
*   **Modular Component Design:** Imports a significant number of custom components and utility functions, highlighting a modular and component-driven architecture.

## 4:07:36 PM
The log primarily details changes to two React component files, `Report.jsx` and `Finance.jsx`, all occurring on October 27, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\src\pages\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/27/2025, 1:26:04 PM, 1:26:11 PM, 2:39:45 PM
        *   During these early timestamps, the entire content of the `Report.jsx` file was commented out. This included the React component definition, state management (using `useState` for `reports`, `filteredReports`, `loading`, `searchText`, `filterCategory`, `filterStatus`, `currentPage`, `itemsPerPage`), mock report data (`mockReports`), data loading and filtering logic (`loadReports`, `applyFiltersAndSort`), report metric calculations, and functions for dynamic styling and icon selection (`getStatusColor`, `getStatusIcon`, `getCategoryIcon`, `getFormatIcon`). The JSX structure for displaying report summary cards and a report table was also commented.
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/27/2025, 2:46:12 PM
        *   The most significant change occurred here: the entire `Report.jsx` file was uncommented and activated.
        *   Imports from `lucide-react` were enabled, including icons like `Search`, `FileText`, `Download`, `Eye`, `TrendingUp`, `BarChart3`, `PieChart`, `Users`, `DollarSign`, `ShoppingCart`, `Clock`, `CheckCircle`, `AlertTriangle`, `RefreshCw`, `FileSpreadsheet`, and `FileBarChart`. Notably, some previously commented imports (`Calendar`, `Filter`, `TrendingDown`, `ChevronDown`) were not included in the final uncommented import list.
        *   The component now fully renders, displaying report summary cards (Total Reports, Completed, Processing, Total Downloads) with dynamic data, icons, and styling.
        *   Color schema updates for certain elements were introduced, using specific hex codes like `#293a90` for processing status, analytics, and total report icons, and `#eb0082` for finance, marketing, and download icons.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\src\pages\Finance.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/27/2025, 2:44:39 PM
        *   Similar to `Report.jsx`, the entire `Finance.jsx` file was initially commented out. This included the React component definition, state management (for `transactions`, `filteredTransactions`, `loading`, `searchText`, `filterType`, `filterStatus`, `currentPage`, `itemsPerPage`), mock financial data (`mockTransactions`), data loading and filtering logic (`loadTransactions`, `applyFiltersAndSort`), financial metric calculations, and styling/icon functions (`getTypeColor`, `getTypeIcon`, `getStatusColor`). The JSX structure for financial summary and transaction tables was also commented.
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/27/2025, 2:45:24 PM
        *   The entire `Finance.jsx` file was uncommented and activated.
        *   Imports from `lucide-react` were enabled, including `Search`, `TrendingUp`, `TrendingDown`, `DollarSign`, `CreditCard`, `PiggyBank`, `Receipt`, `Calendar`, `ArrowUpRight`, `ArrowDownLeft`, `ChevronDown`, `Filter`, `Download`, `Eye`.
        *   The component now fully renders, displaying financial summary cards (Total Revenue, Total Expenses, Net Profit, Pending Amount) and a transaction summary (Total, Completed, Pending transactions) with dynamic data, icons, and styling.
        *   Custom color codes like `#293a90` and `#eb0082` are consistently used for various card backgrounds, text, and icons, similar to the `Report.jsx` file.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Temporary Disabling/Enabling:** Both `Report.jsx` and `Finance.jsx` show a clear pattern of being entirely commented out for a period, then entirely uncommented within minutes of each other. This suggests a concerted effort to activate these components, possibly after a period of development or temporary deactivation.
*   **React Component Structure:** Both files define functional React components using `useState` for internal state management and `useEffect` hooks for data loading and applying filters/sorting.
*   **Mock Data:** Both components rely heavily on hardcoded `mock` data arrays (`mockReports`, `mockTransactions`) rather than fetching from an external API, indicating they are likely frontend-focused components under development.
*   **Filtering and Pagination:** Both implement client-side search, filtering by various criteria (category/type, status), sorting by date, and pagination logic to manage displayed data.
*   **Consistent UI/UX Elements:** Both utilize `lucide-react` icons and Tailwind CSS classes extensively for styling. They employ similar patterns for displaying summary cards in a grid layout (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4 mb-6`) and apply consistent visual cues (e.g., green for positive/completed, red for negative/failed/expenses).
*   **Custom Color Palette:** A recurring theme is the introduction and consistent application of specific custom colors (e.g., `#293a90`, `#eb0082`) across both components for background accents, text, and icons, suggesting a unified brand or theme.
*   **Timestamp Concentration:** All recorded changes are tightly clustered on October 27, 2025, indicating a focused work session on activating and refining these two reporting/finance dashboard components.

## 4:15:16 PM
The changes primarily affect two files: a core header component and a signup component, with additional logs for an environment configuration file which will not be summarized due to potential key storage.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Header\Header.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM)**
    *   This file, a React component named `Header`, shows extensive updates, indicating a refactor or significant feature additions.
    *   **Imports:** It now imports a wide array of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useCallback`), Next.js specific hooks (`usePathname`), Redux hooks (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`), utility components (`ErrorToast`, `SessionOut`, `Searchbar`, `TawkMessenger`, `Tooltip`, `LockTooltip`, `HeaderLock`, `MorePower`, `SelectPopup`, `ErrorAlerts`, `SignupStep`), and services (`auth.service`, `user.service`, `token.service`). Several imports are commented out, suggesting previous implementations or alternatives were considered.
    *   **State Management:** The component manages various states including `tempToken`, `loading` indicators, dropdown visibility (`socialDropDown`, `campaignDropDown`), notification states (`showSelectPopup`, `showNotifications`), online status (`isOnline`), mobile menu visibility (`mobileMenu`), user `roleType`, remaining freebie days (`remaingDays`), and user login status.
    *   **API Interactions:** It interacts with several APIs through `userService` for operations like fetching a `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT`, and user `logout`.
    *   **User Tracking & Analytics:**
        *   A `postTracking` function is implemented to send user interaction data (`userId`, `pageName`, `clickId`) to a `PostTracking` API endpoint, triggered by `pathname` changes.
        *   Google Analytics (GA_TRACKING_ID: `G-L6REHKD7DC`) initialization and tracking code were added, explicitly marked as provided by "RAZI ON 06/02/2025". This suggests a new or updated analytics integration.
    *   **UI/UX Elements:** Implements logic for managing dropdowns (`outSide` function with `useRef`), displaying announcements (`stripAnnouncement`), and potentially showing popups based on remaining freebie days (`showPopup`).
    *   **Navigation:** Defines a `mainNav` array for navigation links, with several sections (`Brand`, `Social`, `Campaigns`, `Top Journalists`) commented out, indicating a streamlined or simplified navigation structure focused on "Home" and "MyCRM".
    *   **Security:** Includes a `logout` function that clears `localStorage` and removes cookies.
    *   A potential typo (`LockTooktip` instead of `LockTooltip`) is present in the imports.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\BeforeLoginPages\Auth\SignUp.jsx` (Timestamps: 10/27/2025, 3:18:29 PM, 3:18:36 PM, 3:19:28 PM, 3:19:57 PM, 3:37:39 PM)**
    *   All content in this file across multiple logged changes is entirely commented out.
    *   The commented code reveals a previously active or planned `FreebiesPage` component intended for user signup.
    *   It included functionality for user registration (`FREESIGNUP`), OTP verification, password validation (requiring uppercase, digit, special character, and minimum 8 length), email validation (specifically preventing public email domains), and managing various form states (`isLoading`, `buttonDisabled`, error messages).
    *   The component also featured SEO metadata using a `useMetadata` hook and referenced `Navbar`, `Footer`, and `SkribeLite` components.
    *   The repeated logging of this fully commented-out state across several timestamps suggests that the `SignUp` functionality might have been temporarily disabled or moved, with the commented code preserved for reference.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM:** Major update to the `Header.jsx` component, including new features like Google Analytics, API integrations, and robust state management.
*   **10/27/2025, 3:18:29 PM - 3:37:39 PM:** Multiple logs for `SignUp.jsx`, consistently showing the entire file's content as commented out. This indicates a period where the signup functionality was disabled or undergoing review without active code changes being committed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Next.js Adoption:** The use of `next/link` and `usePathname` in `Header.jsx` indicates the project is using Next.js for routing and potentially server-side rendering/static site generation.
*   **React Hooks:** Heavy reliance on React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) for component logic and state management across `Header.jsx`.
*   **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Interactions with dedicated `userService`, `auth.service`, and `token.service` are prominent, suggesting a structured approach to API communication.
*   **Constant Usage:** Frequent use of constants (e.g., `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `USERINFO`, `SOCIALURL`) for API endpoints and configuration values, promoting maintainability.
*   **Google Analytics Integration:** A recent addition (dated 06/02/2025 within the code comments) of Google Analytics tracking for user behavior.
*   **Placeholder/Disabled Code:** The `SignUp.jsx` file consistently appears fully commented out, suggesting its functionality is currently paused or has been replaced, but the code is kept for historical context or future re-activation.

## 5:07:38 PM
The code change log primarily details updates to two React components: `Report.jsx` and `Finance.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\src\pages\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/27/2025, 1:26:04 PM to 2:39:45 PM**: This file initially contained a complete, but entirely commented-out, React functional component for generating and displaying various reports. It included state management for reports, filters, search, and pagination. Mock report data was defined, along with functions for loading, filtering, and sorting reports, calculating key metrics (total, completed, processing, failed reports, total downloads), and helper functions to dynamically assign styles and Lucide icons based on report status, category, and format. The return JSX block, which outlined report summary cards, was also present but commented out.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/27/2025, 2:46:12 PM**: All the previously commented-out code in `Report.jsx` was uncommented and activated. This made the report management functionality live. Minor adjustments were made to the `lucide-react` imports (some icons like `Calendar`, `Filter`, `ChevronDown`, `TrendingDown` were removed). Styling was refined for the "processing" status and for "Analytics," "Finance," and "Marketing" categories, introducing specific brand-like color codes (`#293a90`, `#eb0082`) for icons and text. The JSX for displaying report summary cards (`TOTAL REPORTS`, `COMPLETED`, `PROCESSING`, `TOTAL DOWNLOADS`) was fully implemented and integrated.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com\src\pages\Finance.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/27/2025, 2:44:39 PM**: Similar to `Report.jsx`, this file started as a fully commented-out React functional component for managing financial transactions. It featured state for transactions, filters, search, and pagination. Mock financial transaction data was included, along with logic for loading, filtering, and sorting transactions, calculating financial metrics (total income, total expenses, net profit, pending amount), and helper functions for dynamic styling and Lucide icons based on transaction type and status. The initial JSX structure for financial summary cards was present but commented out.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/27/2025, 2:45:24 PM**: The entire `Finance.jsx` component was uncommented and activated. This brought the financial transaction management system online. The `lucide-react` imports were fully utilized, and comprehensive financial summary cards (`TOTAL REVENUE`, `TOTAL EXPENSES`, `NET PROFIT`, `PENDING AMOUNT`) were rendered, including dynamic color changes for `NET PROFIT` based on its value and specific brand colors (`#293a90`, `#eb0082`) for various UI elements. Additional summary cards for `Total Transactions` and `Completed` transactions were also activated.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/27/2025, 2:45:24 PM**: The `Finance.jsx` component transitioned from a commented-out placeholder to an active, functional component.
*   **10/27/2025, 2:46:12 PM**: The `Report.jsx` component similarly transitioned from being fully commented out to an active, functional component, with slight styling and import refinements.

These timestamps indicate a concentrated effort to activate or enable these two core dashboard components within minutes of each other.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Commenting/Uncommenting Paradigm**: Both files show a clear pattern of having a complete React component entirely commented out, then subsequently uncommented to make it active. This suggests a development workflow where features were temporarily disabled or prepared before full activation.
*   **React Functional Components**: Both `Report.jsx` and `Finance.jsx` are implemented as React functional components, extensively using `useState` for local state management (data, loading, search, filters, pagination) and `useEffect` for data loading and applying filters/sorting.
*   **Mock Data for Development**: Both components utilize `mockReports` and `mockTransactions`, indicating they were developed or are currently operating with placeholder data.
*   **Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination**: A consistent pattern of implementing search, category/type filters, status filters, sorting by date, and client-side pagination is present in both components.
*   **Dynamic UI with Icons and Styling**: Both components heavily rely on `lucide-react` for a wide range of icons and Tailwind CSS for styling. They employ helper functions (`getStatusColor`, `getCategoryIcon`, `getTypeColor`, etc.) to dynamically apply styles (e.g., color, borders) and icons based on data attributes.
*   **Dashboard Summary Structure**: Both components adopt a similar UI layout, starting with a grid of "summary cards" that display key metrics, followed by filtering options and then a detailed list/table of the main data (reports or transactions).
*   **Brand Color Integration**: Both files introduced or refined specific hexadecimal color codes (`#293a90`, `#eb0082`) into their Tailwind CSS classes for icons and text, suggesting a consistent brand aesthetic across the application.

## 5:15:21 PM
**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Header\Header.jsx`**
**Timestamp: 10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM**
This update to the `Header` component introduces significant functionality and integrations.
Key changes include:
*   **Imports:** Added several new imports related to UI components (`Searchbar`, `TawkMessenger`, `Tooltip`, `LockTooltip`, `HeaderLock`, `MorePower`, `SelectPopup`, `SignupStep`), context providers (`usePopup`, `useNotification`), and utilities (`sendTrackingData`, `debug`). It also updates routing imports to use Next.js specific `Link` and `usePathname`.
*   **State Management:** Expanded state variables to manage various UI elements and data, such as `tempToken`, dropdown visibility (`socialDropDown`, `campaignDropDown`), loading states (`loading`, `stripLoading`), popup states (`showSelectPopup`, `isOpen`, `isSelectPopupOpen`), network status (`isOnline`), mobile menu visibility (`mobileMenu`), user role and freebies status (`roleType`, `remaingDays`), and a re-render trigger for login status.
*   **API Integrations:**
    *   `fetchTransferToken`: A new asynchronous function to fetch a transfer token and then open a new window to a social URL (`SOCIALURL`) with the received token.
    *   `FreeDays`: Fetches the remaining days for "Freebies" users and triggers a popup if days remaining are zero.
    *   `stripAnnouncement`: Fetches active announcements from `ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT` endpoint.
*   **User Interaction & Logout:** Implemented an `applogout` function that clears local storage, removes a cookie via an API endpoint, calls a `service.logout()` method, and redirects to the homepage. Dropdown menus (`socialDropDown`, `campaignDropDown`) now close when clicked outside, managed by `useRef` and an `outSide` click handler.
*   **Tracking:** A `postTracking` function was added to send user tracking data (userId, pageName, clickId) to a `PostTracking` API endpoint, triggered on `pathname` changes.
*   **Google Analytics:** A large block of Google Analytics tracking code (`GA_TRACKING_ID: G-L6REHKD7DC`) is present but entirely commented out. It is noted as being "GIVEN BY RAZI ON 06/02/2025," which is a future date.
*   **Navigation:** The `mainNav` array defines primary navigation links, with "Home" and "MyCRM" being active, while sections like "Brand", "Social", "Campaigns", and "Top Journalists" are commented out.
*   **Online Status:** `useEffect` hooks are implemented to listen for `online` and `offline` browser events to update `isOnline` state.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\BeforeLoginPages\Auth\SignUp.jsx`**
**Timestamps: 10/27/2025, 3:18:29 PM, 3:18:36 PM, 3:19:28 PM, 3:19:57 PM, 3:37:39 PM**
Across all these timestamps, the entire content of the `SignUp.jsx` file is commented out. This suggests that the component or its functionality has been temporarily disabled or is undergoing a complete rewrite.
When uncommented, the file contains a `FreebiesPage` component intended for user signup:
*   **Functionality:** It includes state management for form inputs (`accountDetail`), OTP handling (`otp`, `refs`), password confirmation, loading states, and error messages.
*   **Validation:** Extensive client-side validation is implemented for required fields (organization name, user name, email, phone number), minimum lengths, and password complexity (at least 8 characters, one uppercase, one number, one special character).
*   **Email Domain Check:** A notable feature is `isPublicEmail`, which checks if the entered email domain belongs to a list of common public email providers (e.g., gmail.com, yahoo.com) and prevents signup with such emails, requiring a "company email address."
*   **Local Storage:** It interacts with `localStorage` to store `userInfo` after a successful signup and to clear existing `user` or `userInfo` items on component mount.
*   **SEO:** Includes a `useMetadata` hook with a schema definition for SEO.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Future Timestamps:** Both `Header.jsx` and `SignUp.jsx` include timestamps and internal comments referencing dates in 2025, which are in the future relative to the current date. This might indicate planned development, placeholder dates, or a discrepancy in the logging system.
*   **Local Storage Usage:** `localStorage` is extensively used across components for storing `userInfo` and managing session-related data.
*   **`userService` and `constants`:** Both files heavily rely on `userService` for API calls and import various constants (e.g., `USERINFO`, `FREESIGNUP`, `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT`, `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `SOCIALURL`) from a centralized `../../constants` file.
*   **`useEffect` Hooks:** Frequent use of `useEffect` for side effects, data fetching, event listeners, and lifecycle management is a consistent pattern in both components.
*   **Commented-out Code:** The `SignUp.jsx` file is entirely commented out across multiple entries, indicating a significant, possibly temporary, disabling of this feature. The `Header.jsx` also contains commented-out code, including large sections of navigation and Google Analytics implementation.
