## 11:14:36 AM
The provided log details a significant update to the `Hero.jsx` component, located at `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\BeforeLogin\Landing\Hero.jsx`, timestamped October 27, 2025, at 10:18:13 AM.

This update introduces or refines the main landing page hero section. Key changes and characteristics include:

*   **Header Redesign**: The header now features a `Socion Logo` (image `/assets/logo.png`) and two prominent buttons for "Sign Up" (`/signup-pro`) and "Login" (`/login`). A previously existing "Get Early Access" button and a text-based "Socion" logo appear to be commented out, indicating design iteration or a shift in the primary call to action.
*   **Hero Content**: The main section highlights the value proposition: "Discover Influencers Before They Go Mainstream," supported by a description and a bulleted list of benefits ("Spot rising stars," "Evaluate fit and performance," "Works across Instagram, YouTube & more"). A "Get Started" button links directly to the login page.
*   **Visual Elements**: The component makes extensive use of images. A large background image (`/assets/social-bg.webp`) covers the section, and a grid of six distinct influencer-themed images (`/assets/social-1.webp` through `/assets/social-6.webp`) is displayed prominently, each with `rounded-[40px]` styling.
*   **Styling and Technology**: The component is built using Next.js (indicated by `import Link from "next/link"`) and leverages Tailwind CSS for styling. Recurring patterns include specific brand colors like a prominent red-orange (`#E96D70`) for buttons and text, a lighter background shade (`#F4BB3F33`), and consistent `rounded-lg` or `rounded-[40px]` styles for UI elements and images. Many elements use `max-w-7xl mx-auto` for consistent content width and centering.

## 11:15:12 AM
The `Header.jsx` file, timestamped 10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM, has undergone significant changes, primarily focused on enhancing user experience, tracking, and integration with various services.

**File-specific updates for `Header.jsx`:**

*   **Extensive Imports:** The component now imports a wide array of utilities, services, and components. This includes Next.js navigation hooks (`usePathname`, `next/link`), Redux for state management (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`), custom services (`auth.service`, `user.service`, `token.service`), and numerous custom UI components for features like toasts, session management, search, chat, tooltips, popups, error alerts, and signup steps.
*   **State Management:** Many new `useState` variables have been introduced to manage UI states (e.g., dropdown visibility, loading indicators, popup visibility, online status, mobile menu, user role, remaining freebie days). `useRef` is used for managing DOM element references, specifically for dropdowns.
*   **User and Session Management:**
    *   A `fetchTransferToken` function is implemented to securely fetch and use a token for integration with `SOCIALURL`.
    *   The `applogout` function now clears `localStorage`, removes a cookie via an API endpoint (`/api/remove-cookie`), and redirects the user to the homepage.
    *   It retrieves user `roleType` and checks for "Freebies" to trigger a `FreeDays` API call, which in turn can show a `showPopup` if `remaingDays` is 0.
*   **Tracking and Analytics:**
    *   A `postTracking` function sends detailed user interaction data (userId, pageName, clickId) to a `PostTracking` API endpoint. This function is invoked on every `pathname` change, indicating a robust system for monitoring user navigation.
    *   A new Google Analytics (GA) tracking block has been added, identified by the comment `[FOLLOWING GA TRACKING CODE GIVEN BY RAZI ON 06/02/2025 START]`. It initializes GA with `GA_TRACKING_ID = "G-L6REHKD7DC"` and tracks user identification (`userId`, `userName`). This is a major update indicating a new analytics initiative.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Includes logic to handle online/offline status, updating the UI if the user's internet connection changes.
    *   Dropdowns for "social" and "campaign" are managed with `outSide` click detection for closing.
    *   An `stripAnnouncement` function fetches and displays active announcements, likely for banners or notifications.
    *   The `mainNav` array defines navigation links, with current active links for "Home" (`/dashboard`) and "MyCRM" (`/mycrm`), while many other navigation items (e.g., "Brand", "Social" with X, Instagram, Podcast, "Campaigns") are commented out, suggesting potential future features or past iterations.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Logic for `loginStatus` and `shouldRender` is included, related to dynamically showing a "GO To SOCION" button based on login status.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API-centric development:** The component frequently interacts with various backend APIs (`userService.post`, `userService.get`) for fetching data (e.g., transfer tokens, freebies days, announcements) and sending data (e.g., tracking data, logout).
*   **Heavy use of React Hooks:** `useState` and `useEffect` are extensively used to manage component state, side effects, and lifecycle events.
*   **Modular design:** The component imports many smaller, specialized components (e.g., `Tooltip`, `Searchbar`, `ErrorToast`), suggesting a modular approach to UI development.
*   **Commented-out code:** Several sections of code, including navigation items and an `useEffect` for clearing `localStorage` on `beforeunload`, are commented out. This could indicate features under development, experimental code, or deprecated functionalities that have been preserved for reference.
*   **Constants:** Relies heavily on imported constants (e.g., `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `SOCIALURL`) for API endpoints and configuration values, promoting maintainability.

The `.env` files were not summarized as per the instructions, as they typically contain sensitive configuration and environment variables.

    *   The header CTA saw multiple, rapid revisions between **11:39:44 AM and 11:45:41 AM**, focusing on the urgency of data archiving. It transitioned through awkward phrasings before settling on "Your data will be archived soon act now to keep it live." The highlighted text's font size was adjusted to `22px` and its weight to `700` at **11:45:41 AM**.
    *   The body content explicitly states that Socion trial data will be "archived permanently in the next few days" and that users will "lose your saved work and setups." It strongly urges reactivation with the "30-day money-back guarantee" to ensure "Immediate access to your existing data." The call to action is "Reactivate Now."

6.  **`Weekly_Nurture.html`**:
    *   This file was introduced at **11:41:19 AM** for weekly engagement.
    *   Its header CTA, initially inheriting text about data archiving, was quickly changed through several iterations between **11:41:32 AM and 11:43:51 AM** to a more fitting message: "How PR teams achieve more with Socion." The highlighted text's font weight was set to `700` at **11:43:30 AM**.
    *   The body content outlines that the email will share "stories, insights, and quick wins" about Socion, including a user story, feature highlight on "Real-time media alerts," and an FAQ about the money-back guarantee. The button is "Upgrade Now."

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HTML Email Structure:** All files adhere to a consistent HTML email template structure, utilizing tables for layout, inline CSS for styling, external Google Fonts (`Inter`, `Source Sans 3`), and incorporating a top banner image (`bg-header-socion.png`) and Socion logo (`socion-logo2.png`).
*   **Brand Consistency:** The "Socion" logo, "Team Socion" sign-off, and social media links (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X/Twitter) are present in all emails, reinforcing brand identity. "Powered by: skribe" also appears consistently.
*   **Trial & Money-Back Guarantee:** A central theme across all templates is the promotion of a "30-day money-back guarantee" or "zero risk" offer for Socion, aiming to convert trial users or attract new ones.
*   **Header CTA Evolution:** The most frequently modified element across all files is the main header Call-to-Action (CTA) box. It undergoes continuous refinement in wording, line breaks, font size, and font weight (especially for highlighted yellow text, typically using `#FFE55C` color) to optimize its impact.
*   **Targeted Messaging:** While the underlying structure is similar, the body content clearly diverges to target different user segments:
    *   **Existing Users (Trial Ended):** Emails like `Don’t_Lose_Your_Work_Existing_Users_30 Oct.html` and `Final_Call_Existing_Users_6Nov.html` focus on the urgency of reactivation to prevent data loss.
    *   **New Leads:** `Launch_Offer_New_Leads_27Oct.html` introduces Socion's benefits from scratch.
    *   **General/Nurture:** `30_Day_Safety_Net_1_Nov.html` offers a broader overview, and `Weekly_Nurture.html` focuses on ongoing engagement and feature highlights.
*   **Consistent Styling for Highlights:** Key phrases in the email body are consistently highlighted using `color: #02BD6D; font-weight: 600;`.
*   **Standard CTA Button:** All primary call-to-action buttons share similar styling (red background `#E23A27`, white text, rounded corners, box-shadow) and link to the same signup URL (`https://www.socion.in/signup-pro`), although the button text varies (e.g., "Activate Plan," "Start Now," "Continue Account," "Reactivate Now," "Upgrade Now").

In summary, the log illustrates a concentrated effort to rapidly develop and refine a suite of HTML email marketing templates for Socion, tailoring messages for different stages of the user journey (new leads, existing trial users, final reminders, weekly nurturing) while maintaining a consistent visual brand and a central "risk-free" offer. The numerous timestamped changes on a single day indicate an agile and iterative development process for these critical communication assets.

## 12:14:39 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\BeforeLogin\Landing\Hero.jsx`, last updated on 10/27/2025 at 10:18:13 AM, defines a `HeroPage` React component. This component functions as the main hero section for a landing page, built using Next.js for navigation and extensively styled with Tailwind CSS.

**Key updates and characteristics of this file include:**

*   **Structure and Content:** It presents a bold headline "Discover Influencers Before They Go Mainstream," accompanied by a descriptive paragraph and a bulleted list highlighting benefits like "Spot rising stars before they go viral."
*   **Visual Elements:** The component uses a `social-bg.webp` as a full-width background, displays a `logo.png`, and features a dynamic grid of six distinct influencer-themed images (`social-1.webp` through `social-6.webp`), all with `rounded-[40px]` corners.
*   **Navigation and Calls to Action:** It integrates `next/link` components for user interaction, providing "Sign Up," "Login," and a "Get Started" button in the hero section, all directing to `/signup-pro` or `/login` routes.
*   **Styling Patterns:** There's a consistent application of Tailwind CSS classes, frequently using specific hex colors such as `#E96D70` for primary button backgrounds and text (with a hover effect changing to `#ff4f4f`), and `#F4BB3F33` for section backgrounds. Image elements and buttons consistently feature rounded corners. Text sizes are responsively scaled using `md:` and `lg:` prefixes.
*   **Commented Code:** The presence of commented-out code suggests previous iterations included a text-based "Socion" logo and a "Get Early Access" button linked to a `scrollToCTA` prop, indicating a shift towards the current image-based logo and direct sign-up/login buttons.
