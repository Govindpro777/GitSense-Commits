The provided log details a significant update to the `Hero.jsx` component, located at `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\BeforeLogin\Landing\Hero.jsx`, timestamped October 27, 2025, at 10:18:13 AM.

This update introduces or refines the main landing page hero section. Key changes and characteristics include:

*   **Header Redesign**: The header now features a `Socion Logo` (image `/assets/logo.png`) and two prominent buttons for "Sign Up" (`/signup-pro`) and "Login" (`/login`). A previously existing "Get Early Access" button and a text-based "Socion" logo appear to be commented out, indicating design iteration or a shift in the primary call to action.
*   **Hero Content**: The main section highlights the value proposition: "Discover Influencers Before They Go Mainstream," supported by a description and a bulleted list of benefits ("Spot rising stars," "Evaluate fit and performance," "Works across Instagram, YouTube & more"). A "Get Started" button links directly to the login page.
*   **Visual Elements**: The component makes extensive use of images. A large background image (`/assets/social-bg.webp`) covers the section, and a grid of six distinct influencer-themed images (`/assets/social-1.webp` through `/assets/social-6.webp`) is displayed prominently, each with `rounded-[40px]` styling.
*   **Styling and Technology**: The component is built using Next.js (indicated by `import Link from "next/link"`) and leverages Tailwind CSS for styling. Recurring patterns include specific brand colors like a prominent red-orange (`#E96D70`) for buttons and text, a lighter background shade (`#F4BB3F33`), and consistent `rounded-lg` or `rounded-[40px]` styles for UI elements and images. Many elements use `max-w-7xl mx-auto` for consistent content width and centering.

## 11:15:12 AM
The `Header.jsx` file, timestamped 10/27/2025, 10:39:06 AM, has undergone significant changes, primarily focused on enhancing user experience, tracking, and integration with various services.

**File-specific updates for `Header.jsx`:**

*   **Extensive Imports:** The component now imports a wide array of utilities, services, and components. This includes Next.js navigation hooks (`usePathname`, `next/link`), Redux for state management (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`), custom services (`auth.service`, `user.service`, `token.service`), and numerous custom UI components for features like toasts, session management, search, chat, tooltips, popups, error alerts, and signup steps.
*   **State Management:** Many new `useState` variables have been introduced to manage UI states (e.g., dropdown visibility, loading indicators, popup visibility, online status, mobile menu, user role, remaining freebie days). `useRef` is used for managing DOM element references, specifically for dropdowns.
*   **User and Session Management:**
    *   A `fetchTransferToken` function is implemented to securely fetch and use a token for integration with `SOCIALURL`.
    *   The `applogout` function now clears `localStorage`, removes a cookie via an API endpoint (`/api/remove-cookie`), and redirects the user to the homepage.
    *   It retrieves user `roleType` and checks for "Freebies" to trigger a `FreeDays` API call, which in turn can show a `showPopup` if `remaingDays` is 0.
*   **Tracking and Analytics:**
    *   A `postTracking` function sends detailed user interaction data (userId, pageName, clickId) to a `PostTracking` API endpoint. This function is invoked on every `pathname` change, indicating a robust system for monitoring user navigation.
    *   A new Google Analytics (GA) tracking block has been added, identified by the comment `[FOLLOWING GA TRACKING CODE GIVEN BY RAZI ON 06/02/2025 START]`. It initializes GA with `GA_TRACKING_ID = "G-L6REHKD7DC"` and tracks user identification (`userId`, `userName`). This is a major update indicating a new analytics initiative.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Includes logic to handle online/offline status, updating the UI if the user's internet connection changes.
    *   Dropdowns for "social" and "campaign" are managed with `outSide` click detection for closing.
    *   An `stripAnnouncement` function fetches and displays active announcements, likely for banners or notifications.
    *   The `mainNav` array defines navigation links, with current active links for "Home" (`/dashboard`) and "MyCRM" (`/mycrm`), while many other navigation items (e.g., "Brand", "Social" with X, Instagram, Podcast, "Campaigns") are commented out, suggesting potential future features or past iterations.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Logic for `loginStatus` and `shouldRender` is included, related to dynamically showing a "GO To SOCION" button based on login status.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API-centric development:** The component frequently interacts with various backend APIs (`userService.post`, `userService.get`) for fetching data (e.g., transfer tokens, freebies days, announcements) and sending data (e.g., tracking data, logout).
*   **Heavy use of React Hooks:** `useState` and `useEffect` are extensively used to manage component state, side effects, and lifecycle events.
*   **Modular design:** The component imports many smaller, specialized components (e.g., `Tooltip`, `Searchbar`, `ErrorToast`), suggesting a modular approach to UI development.
*   **Commented-out code:** Several sections of code, including navigation items and an `useEffect` for clearing `localStorage` on `beforeunload`, are commented out. This could indicate features under development, experimental code, or deprecated functionalities that have been preserved for reference.
*   **Constants:** Relies heavily on imported constants (e.g., `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `SOCIALURL`) for API endpoints and configuration values, promoting maintainability.
