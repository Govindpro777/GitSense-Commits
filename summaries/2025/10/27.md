The provided log details a significant update to the `Hero.jsx` component, located at `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\BeforeLogin\Landing\Hero.jsx`, timestamped October 27, 2025, at 10:18:13 AM.

This update introduces or refines the main landing page hero section. Key changes and characteristics include:

*   **Header Redesign**: The header now features a `Socion Logo` (image `/assets/logo.png`) and two prominent buttons for "Sign Up" (`/signup-pro`) and "Login" (`/login`). A previously existing "Get Early Access" button and a text-based "Socion" logo appear to be commented out, indicating design iteration or a shift in the primary call to action.
*   **Hero Content**: The main section highlights the value proposition: "Discover Influencers Before They Go Mainstream," supported by a description and a bulleted list of benefits ("Spot rising stars," "Evaluate fit and performance," "Works across Instagram, YouTube & more"). A "Get Started" button links directly to the login page.
*   **Visual Elements**: The component makes extensive use of images. A large background image (`/assets/social-bg.webp`) covers the section, and a grid of six distinct influencer-themed images (`/assets/social-1.webp` through `/assets/social-6.webp`) is displayed prominently, each with `rounded-[40px]` styling.
*   **Styling and Technology**: The component is built using Next.js (indicated by `import Link from "next/link"`) and leverages Tailwind CSS for styling. Recurring patterns include specific brand colors like a prominent red-orange (`#E96D70`) for buttons and text, a lighter background shade (`#F4BB3F33`), and consistent `rounded-lg` or `rounded-[40px]` styles for UI elements and images. Many elements use `max-w-7xl mx-auto` for consistent content width and centering.
