# Activity Summary for 6/21/2025

## 10:36:40 AM
The provided code log shows two entries for the file `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend\src\pages\Gallery.jsx`, both at approximately 9:52 AM on June 21st, 2025.  The two entries are identical, suggesting either a redundant log entry or a failed update attempt.

The code itself is a React component responsible for displaying a gallery of images.  Key features include:

* **Data Fetching:** The component fetches order data and associated files from an API (`/api/v1/admin/getOrders` and  `/api/v1/admin/files/order/{order._id}`).  Authentication is handled using a token from local storage.  The fetched data includes reference images, uploaded images, CAD files, and text files.

* **Image Search:**  An image search functionality is implemented using a separate API endpoint (`import.meta.env.VITE_FAST_API/search`).  The search sends the image file to the API, receives results, and filters for similarity greater than or equal to 70%. Results are displayed for 3 seconds before being cleared.

* **Filtering and Sorting:**  The gallery allows filtering by order status and sorting by creation date, order ID, or customer name.

* **Pagination:**  Pagination is implemented to display images in chunks of 20 per page.

* **View Modes:**  The code suggests a grid and list view functionality (though the implementation is not visible in the provided snippet).

* **Error Handling:**  Error handling is implemented using a state variable (`error`) which auto-clears after 8 seconds.

* **Download and View:** Functionality is provided to download and view images directly from the gallery.

The code uses `lucide-react` for icons and extensively uses functional components and hooks.  No functional changes are observable between the two log entries.
