# Activity Summary for 6/15/2025

## 11:33:44 PM
The codebase underwent several revisions on June 15, 2025.  The most significant changes involved the `Narratives2.tsx` and `Narratives.tsx` files.

`Narratives2.tsx` was modified twice. The first revision (10:37:32 PM) shows commented-out code representing an earlier version of a component that displays narrative data. This version featured a section header with a logo and displayed narrative details (type, count, title, author, sources, publication, category, date, description, and links).  The second revision (10:39:36 PM) replaced the commented-out code with a functional component displaying similar narrative data, but with a simpler structure and fewer narratives listed.  The data displayed also changed,  showing different narratives.  The earlier version included data for Google Pixel and Google Gemini, while the later one focused on Groww's CCI approval.


`Narratives.tsx` (11:08:16 PM) was completely rewritten. The original version imported a `TimelineChart` component and the `NarrativesSection` component; however, the final version eliminated these imports and created a new component named `CombinedNarratives`. This new component uses the `react-apexcharts` library to render a line chart visualizing narrative data over time, along with a section displaying narrative details  This suggests a refactoring effort to combine timeline visualization with narrative details within a single component. The data used in the chart and the narrative section are related to Groww's CCI approval. The chart shows mentions of the topic over seven unspecified dates ("01-04-25" is repeated).


In summary, the changes reflect a significant shift in the presentation of narrative data. The initial `Narratives2.tsx` contained extensive and detailed narrative information.  Then it transitioned towards a simpler format, with the final `Narratives.tsx`  integrating a visual timeline representation to provide a more concise and combined narrative summary.  There is a recurring pattern in that the narratives appear to focus on a specific set of news items about the company Groww.
