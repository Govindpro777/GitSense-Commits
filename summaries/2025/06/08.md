# Activity Summary for 6/8/2025

## 11:15:52 AM
The log shows code changes primarily focused on the `xpertbuddy-frontend` application, specifically within the review and rating components.

The `ReviewReplyPopup.js` component (updated at 11:06:11 AM) handles replying to student reviews.  It uses `axiosInstance` to send replies to an API endpoint (`/api/common/tutor/reply/review`), requiring `jwtToken` and `tutorId` for authentication and authorization. The component displays review details, including student profile picture, rating, and timestamp using `date-fns` for relative time formatting.  Error handling and loading states are implemented with `toast` notifications and a loading spinner.

The `Rating.js` component (updated multiple times between 11:08:15 AM and 11:09:37 AM) displays and manages tutor reviews.  Significant changes involve refactoring the `fetchReviews` function for better efficiency, converting it into a `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improving code clarity. This component fetches reviews from `/api/common/subject/reviews` using `axiosInstance`,  paginates results, and allows sorting by rating and date. It calculates and displays review statistics (average rating, star counts).  The component renders reviews using a custom `CommentCard` component that includes hover functionality to show tutor profiles.  The `CommentCard` component uses `ui-avatars` as a fallback for missing student/tutor profile pictures.  Error handling is included for API calls. The changes between successive updates to `Rating.js` are mainly focused on optimizing the code and improving the structure using `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks to improve performance.


## 12:15:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `Comments.js` and `Rating.js`.  Both files are located within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, specifically within the tutor reviews section.

`Comments.js` underwent several edits between 11:29 AM and 11:46 AM on June 8th, 2025.  The core changes revolved around the rendering and sanitization of review text.  Initially, the `cleanText` function removed surrounding quotes.  Later revisions incorporated `DOMPurify.sanitize` to further clean the review text, likely for security reasons to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  No structural changes to the component's layout or functionality were observed beyond this sanitization improvement.  The `Comments.js` file, in both its `src\app\tutors\[SubjectName]\reviews` and `src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews` paths, shows consistent modifications across different timestamps suggesting these are related components and the same changes are applied to different locations.

`Rating.js` was modified at 11:36 AM and again at 11:48 AM on June 8th, 2025. The main change involved the addition of `DOMPurify.sanitize` to the `CommentCard` component within `Rating.js`, mirroring the change in `Comments.js`. This indicates a concerted effort to enhance security by sanitizing user-provided content across the review section.  There were also modifications related to the display of  reviews, including formatting changes and the implementation of pagination (`Pagination` component) to handle many reviews.  The `fetchReviews` function uses `axiosInstance` to retrieve reviews from `/api/common/subject/reviews` based on subject name, user ID, page number, and the `jwtToken` from cookies or the auth context.  The `useCallback` hook and `useEffect` hook manage data fetching and updates efficiently.
