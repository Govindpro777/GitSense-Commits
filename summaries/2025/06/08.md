# Activity Summary for 6/8/2025

The log shows code changes primarily focused on the `xpertbuddy-frontend` application, specifically within the review and rating components.

The `ReviewReplyPopup.js` component (updated at 11:06:11 AM) handles replying to student reviews.  It uses `axiosInstance` to send replies to an API endpoint (`/api/common/tutor/reply/review`), requiring `jwtToken` and `tutorId` for authentication and authorization. The component displays review details, including student profile picture, rating, and timestamp using `date-fns` for relative time formatting.  Error handling and loading states are implemented with `toast` notifications and a loading spinner.

The `Rating.js` component (updated multiple times between 11:08:15 AM and 11:09:37 AM) displays and manages tutor reviews.  Significant changes involve refactoring the `fetchReviews` function for better efficiency, converting it into a `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improving code clarity. This component fetches reviews from `/api/common/subject/reviews` using `axiosInstance`,  paginates results, and allows sorting by rating and date. It calculates and displays review statistics (average rating, star counts).  The component renders reviews using a custom `CommentCard` component that includes hover functionality to show tutor profiles.  The `CommentCard` component uses `ui-avatars` as a fallback for missing student/tutor profile pictures.  Error handling is included for API calls. The changes between successive updates to `Rating.js` are mainly focused on optimizing the code and improving the structure using `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks to improve performance.
