# Activity Summary for 6/8/2025

## 11:15:52 AM
The log shows code changes primarily focused on the `xpertbuddy-frontend` application, specifically within the review and rating components.

The `ReviewReplyPopup.js` component (updated at 11:06:11 AM) handles replying to student reviews.  It uses `axiosInstance` to send replies to an API endpoint (`/api/common/tutor/reply/review`), requiring `jwtToken` and `tutorId` for authentication and authorization. The component displays review details, including student profile picture, rating, and timestamp using `date-fns` for relative time formatting.  Error handling and loading states are implemented with `toast` notifications and a loading spinner.

The `Rating.js` component (updated multiple times between 11:08:15 AM and 11:09:37 AM) displays and manages tutor reviews.  Significant changes involve refactoring the `fetchReviews` function for better efficiency, converting it into a `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improving code clarity. This component fetches reviews from `/api/common/subject/reviews` using `axiosInstance`,  paginates results, and allows sorting by rating and date. It calculates and displays review statistics (average rating, star counts).  The component renders reviews using a custom `CommentCard` component that includes hover functionality to show tutor profiles.  The `CommentCard` component uses `ui-avatars` as a fallback for missing student/tutor profile pictures.  Error handling is included for API calls. The changes between successive updates to `Rating.js` are mainly focused on optimizing the code and improving the structure using `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks to improve performance.


## 12:15:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `Comments.js` and `Rating.js`.  Both files are located within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, specifically within the tutor reviews section.

`Comments.js` underwent several edits between 11:29 AM and 11:46 AM on June 8th, 2025.  The core changes revolved around the rendering and sanitization of review text.  Initially, the `cleanText` function removed surrounding quotes.  Later revisions incorporated `DOMPurify.sanitize` to further clean the review text, likely for security reasons to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  No structural changes to the component's layout or functionality were observed beyond this sanitization improvement.  The `Comments.js` file, in both its `src\app\tutors\[SubjectName]\reviews` and `src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews` paths, shows consistent modifications across different timestamps suggesting these are related components and the same changes are applied to different locations.

`Rating.js` was modified at 11:36 AM and again at 11:48 AM on June 8th, 2025. The main change involved the addition of `DOMPurify.sanitize` to the `CommentCard` component within `Rating.js`, mirroring the change in `Comments.js`. This indicates a concerted effort to enhance security by sanitizing user-provided content across the review section.  There were also modifications related to the display of  reviews, including formatting changes and the implementation of pagination (`Pagination` component) to handle many reviews.  The `fetchReviews` function uses `axiosInstance` to retrieve reviews from `/api/common/subject/reviews` based on subject name, user ID, page number, and the `jwtToken` from cookies or the auth context.  The `useCallback` hook and `useEffect` hook manage data fetching and updates efficiently.


## 1:15:53 PM
The provided code represents a React component responsible for displaying and managing tutor reviews.  Several modifications were made throughout the day on June 8th, 2025.

The `Rating.js` component underwent significant changes. Initially, (12:26 PM and 12:37 PM), the code was mostly commented out.  A substantial update at 12:28 PM introduced functionality for fetching and displaying reviews, including pagination, sorting (by date and rating), and handling user authentication using JWT tokens and cookies from `axiosInstance` and `useAuth`.  The component fetches reviews based on subject name and user ID, displaying them with star ratings, timestamps, and allowing for the display of tutor replies.  Error handling and loading indicators are included.  The 12:38 PM update further enhanced this by adding review statistics (average rating, star counts) and functionality to handle hover effects on tutor profiles within reviews to provide quick access to the tutor's profile.

A new component `Comments.js` was added at 12:39 PM. This component focuses on individual review cards, providing features to edit, delete, reply to reviews, toggle featured status, and handle menu interactions. The component uses `axiosInstance` to make API calls for updating the featured status of a review.  It also incorporates loading indicators and error handling using `sonner` for toast notifications.  The `Comments.js` component integrates with the `Rating.js` component through props such as `sortedReviews` and callbacks for managing review updates.  The key addition is the functionality for handling featured reviews, allowing for toggling the featured status of reviews via API calls and showing the result using toast notifications.  The reviews are fetched and displayed using `axiosInstance`.  The display of reviews is also improved with better UI and error handling.  There's also a notable use of `DOMPurify` to sanitize HTML content within reviews for security reasons.

In summary, the modifications reflect a progressive development process, adding features for fetching, displaying, managing, and interacting with tutor reviews, improving both the front-end user interface and back-end API interaction aspects of the application.  There's a clear emphasis on robust error handling and user experience throughout the codebase.


## 4:26:16 PM
The log shows updates to components related to tutor listings and reviews on a React-based frontend.  The most significant changes occurred between 4:05 PM and 4:22 PM on June 8th, 2025.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\tutorListPage\tutor.jsx` underwent two nearly identical updates within a short timeframe (4:05 PM and 4:05 PM). The only difference appears to be the removal of a `headers` section within an `axiosInstance.get` call in the second update. This component handles fetching and displaying a list of tutors, incorporating features such as pagination, filtering, sorting (by filter data and sort option), and showing tutor availability.  It uses `axiosInstance` for API calls, `react-redux` for state management, `js-cookie` for cookie handling, and `lodash` for utility functions. The component fetches data from various endpoints (`/tutor/search/search-filter`, `/tutor/search/now-later-filter`, `/tutor/search/by-subject`), handling potential errors and loading states.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutors\[SubjectName]\reviews\ReviewList.js` was modified twice (4:11 PM and 4:12 PM). The second update uncommented a section to include `<TutorRelatedSubjects>` and `<Footer>` components within the `ReviewList` component.  This component displays a list of reviews for a given subject, using other components like `Hero`, `Rating`, `ReasonsToChoose`, and `FAQHomework`.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\tutorListPage\global\TutorRelatedSubjects.jsx` was updated once at 4:11 PM. This component fetches and displays related subjects based on a search subject, using `axiosInstance` to call `/api/common/subjects/suggestions` and utilizing `react-redux` dispatch for updating state.  It handles loading and error states and dynamically renders subject suggestions with links, intelligently managing layouts across different screen sizes.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutors\[SubjectName]\reviews\Rating.js` underwent multiple updates between 4:15 PM and 4:22 PM.  This component displays tutor reviews, including star ratings, user avatars, review text, pagination and sorting options. It uses `axiosInstance` to fetch reviews from `/api/common/subject/reviews`, handling loading states, errors, and pagination.  The final update at 4:22 PM completely commented out the entire component.  The component also features functionality for displaying and managing tutor profiles on hover.  The use of `DOMPurify` suggests an effort to sanitize HTML content in reviews for security.

A recurring pattern is the extensive use of `axiosInstance` for API calls, `react-redux` for state management, and error handling within the components.  The components also show consistent use of responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS classes to handle different screen sizes.
