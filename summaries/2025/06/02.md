# Activity Summary for 6/2/2025

## 1:41:00 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `page.jsx` file within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, primarily focusing on the hero section's content and styling.  Early changes (between 12:44 AM and 12:47 AM) involve refactoring the import path for the `SearchBar` component and adding `"use client";` directive.  A significant change at 12:47:14 AM alters the hero section's main heading from a general description of private lessons to highlight "AmazingTalker reviews."  Subsequent updates modify the subheading, finally settling on "1872322 students reviews on AmazingTalker".  There are a few minor edits after that, mainly whitespace and formatting changes until 1:02:57 AM. At 1:02:57 AM, major changes to the structure and styling of the Hero component in `page.jsx`  occurred, improving its responsiveness and layout with more semantic HTML.

The `Rating.jsx` file underwent substantial changes, starting at 12:57:26 AM, introducing a comprehensive review management component (`ManageRating`). This component fetches reviews from an API (`/api/common/tutor/get/review`), handles pagination, sorting (by rating, date), and displays them. It also incorporates popups for replying to, editing, deleting reviews, and managing featured reviews, using `axiosInstance` for API calls, `js-cookie` for token management, and `sonner` for toast notifications.  Significant portions of the `Rating.jsx` file were later commented out  at 1:16:39 AM, 1:30:25 AM, 1:31:13 AM, and 1:32:05 AM,  suggesting a potential temporary removal or refactoring before being ultimately removed entirely.

The `Comments.js` file was updated at 1:33:33 AM to improve the styling of the comment cards and also to make the component background white.  The updates include changes in the gap and padding used in the component.

The `page.jsx` file continues to be modified, adding and removing components like `Rating` and  introducing `TutorProfile` at 1:36:42 AM, resulting in a layout featuring both review ratings and a tutor profile side-by-side.  The layout of the page was changed to flex-row at 1:38:34 AM.  Several instances of the `Rating` component were added and removed in `page.jsx` between 1:09:35 AM and 1:35:11 AM, likely reflecting experimentation with placement and integration. The `Hero.jsx` file was also updated several times between 1:10:13 AM and 1:12:16 AM, with formatting and minor text changes in the hero section.


In summary, the codebase reflects a significant effort focused on enhancing the review section of the website, integrating an API for review data, improving UI/UX through styling changes, and reorganizing page layout to include a dedicated tutor profile.  The commented-out sections in `Rating.jsx` suggest an iterative development process.
