# Activity Summary for 6/2/2025

## 1:41:00 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `page.jsx` file within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, primarily focusing on the hero section's content and styling.  Early changes (between 12:44 AM and 12:47 AM) involve refactoring the import path for the `SearchBar` component and adding `"use client";` directive.  A significant change at 12:47:14 AM alters the hero section's main heading from a general description of private lessons to highlight "AmazingTalker reviews."  Subsequent updates modify the subheading, finally settling on "1872322 students reviews on AmazingTalker".  There are a few minor edits after that, mainly whitespace and formatting changes until 1:02:57 AM. At 1:02:57 AM, major changes to the structure and styling of the Hero component in `page.jsx`  occurred, improving its responsiveness and layout with more semantic HTML.

The `Rating.jsx` file underwent substantial changes, starting at 12:57:26 AM, introducing a comprehensive review management component (`ManageRating`). This component fetches reviews from an API (`/api/common/tutor/get/review`), handles pagination, sorting (by rating, date), and displays them. It also incorporates popups for replying to, editing, deleting reviews, and managing featured reviews, using `axiosInstance` for API calls, `js-cookie` for token management, and `sonner` for toast notifications.  Significant portions of the `Rating.jsx` file were later commented out  at 1:16:39 AM, 1:30:25 AM, 1:31:13 AM, and 1:32:05 AM,  suggesting a potential temporary removal or refactoring before being ultimately removed entirely.

The `Comments.js` file was updated at 1:33:33 AM to improve the styling of the comment cards and also to make the component background white.  The updates include changes in the gap and padding used in the component.

The `page.jsx` file continues to be modified, adding and removing components like `Rating` and  introducing `TutorProfile` at 1:36:42 AM, resulting in a layout featuring both review ratings and a tutor profile side-by-side.  The layout of the page was changed to flex-row at 1:38:34 AM.  Several instances of the `Rating` component were added and removed in `page.jsx` between 1:09:35 AM and 1:35:11 AM, likely reflecting experimentation with placement and integration. The `Hero.jsx` file was also updated several times between 1:10:13 AM and 1:12:16 AM, with formatting and minor text changes in the hero section.


In summary, the codebase reflects a significant effort focused on enhancing the review section of the website, integrating an API for review data, improving UI/UX through styling changes, and reorganizing page layout to include a dedicated tutor profile.  The commented-out sections in `Rating.jsx` suggest an iterative development process.


## 11:27:02 AM
The log shows modifications to two React component files: `page.jsx` and `TutorProfile.js`.  `page.jsx` underwent several revisions between 10:47 AM and 10:51 AM, primarily focusing on the layout of its `TutorListPage` component.  Changes involved adjusting the arrangement of `Rating` and `TutorProfile` components using Tailwind CSS classes, transitioning from a row layout to a column layout for smaller screens and back to a responsive row layout.  The flex direction (`flex-row`, `flex-col`, `md:flex-row`) and width (`w-2/3`, `w-1/3`, `w-full`, `md:w-[70%]`, `md:w-[30%]`, `md:w-[75%]`, `md:w-[25%]`)  were altered multiple times.  Finally, a red border (`border border-red-500`) was added at 10:51:01 AM.


The `Rating.jsx` file was updated between 10:51 AM and 10:52 AM.  This update shows the addition of React component code that renders reviews based on dummy data. The code includes components for displaying star ratings, pagination, and individual review cards.  The dummy data consists of eight reviews with attributes like student name, profile picture, rating, review text, timestamp, and featured status. There are helper functions for rendering stars, calculating progress bar width, and formatting dates relative to the current time.  No functional changes were apparent in the multiple commits for this file.


`TutorProfile.js` was extensively modified between 10:53 AM and 11:26 AM. The changes involved refining the visual presentation of tutor profile information, with several iterations focused on the styling of a green verified badge.  The size and shape (`w-4`, `h-4`, `w-[8px]`, `h-[8px]`, `w-[10px]`, `h-[10px]`, `rounded-md`, `rounded-[2px]`, `rounded-[4px]`, `rounded-[8px]`) and surrounding elements of this badge were adjusted over multiple commits.  More substantial changes occured between 11:09 AM and 11:12 AM, where the `Credentials` section was simplified to display all the information in a single span, removing individual `div` elements.  Finally, around 11:23 AM  a significant restructuring of the component occurred, reducing the size and font sizes of the elements for improved visual design.  The overall size of the component was also reduced (`max-w-[400px]` to `max-w-[380px]`). The final changes mainly involved adjusting the styling for images and text sizes for better visual layout and responsiveness.
