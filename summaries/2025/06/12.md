# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 9:29:11 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `AddJournalist.tsx` file, all on June 11th, 2025.  The code is a React component for adding journalist information.  There are no substantive changes between the various commits, only minor variations likely due to auto-formatting or very small edits not impacting the core functionality.

The component uses several React libraries (`react-router-dom`, `react-redux`, `react-select`, `formik`, `sweetalert2`), indicating a reliance on routing, state management, form handling, and alert displays.

The code heavily interacts with a `userService` for fetching and posting data, suggesting communication with a backend API.  The API endpoints used include `/userpreference/geoStateCity`, `/GetCitiesByStateIds`, `/outlet`, `/supplements`, `/shows`, `/outletsupplements`, `/outletshows`, and `/subBeat`. These endpoints are likely used to populate select options and handle form submissions.

The component includes a modal (`ModalComponent`) and dynamically renders components (`Supplement`, `Title`, `Shows`) based on user interaction, indicating a sophisticated user interface for managing journalist details.  The data is managed using several `useState` hooks, suggesting a component that handles a significant amount of data and state.

The `validationSchema` uses `Yup` to validate the journalist's name, ensuring it doesn't start with certain titles or contain abbreviations, and enforcing proper casing.  This indicates a focus on data integrity.  The numerous API calls suggest a complex process for data management.  The repeated code structure across commits implies iterative development and refinements, with the core functionality remaining unchanged.


## 11:29:09 AM
The primary change on June 12th, 2025, at 11:25:03 AM,  involved the `api.ts` file within the `Skribe-Backend` project. This file defines an Axios instance for making API calls.  The key update focuses on enhanced error handling and token refresh mechanisms.

Specifically, the `api.ts` file now includes:

* **Multiple base URLs:**  The code shows commented-out base URLs (`localhost`, `beta.goskribe.com`, `www.goskribe.com`), suggesting ongoing development or testing across different environments.  The currently active base URL appears to be dynamically determined using `getBaseURL()`.

* **Improved token management:** The code implements a robust mechanism for handling 401 (Unauthorized) errors.  If an access token expires, it attempts to refresh the token using a `/Authenticate/refresh-token` endpoint. If the refresh fails, the user is redirected to the login page (`/`). The implementation uses `isRefreshing` and `refreshAccessTokenPromise` to prevent race conditions during token refresh attempts.


* **Network error handling:** The code now includes a more user-friendly alert for network errors, utilizing a component called `Alert`.

* **Header management:**  The axios instance sets headers including "Content-Type" (initially set to `application/json` with commented-out `multipart/form-data` suggesting potential future support for file uploads) and "X-Source-App".

In essence, this commit significantly improved the resilience and security of API interactions by implementing automatic token refresh and more informative error handling.


## 1:10:01 PM
The log shows updates to two React components on June 12th, 2025.

`GenerateReport.tsx` (12:50:41 PM): This component was significantly updated.  The changes center around generating and sending PDF reports.  The component now fetches data from multiple API endpoints using `userService.get` for various report sections (monthly report details, search graphs, campaign graphs, user performance, top campaigns, and month comparisons). It uses `html2canvas` and `jsPDF` to convert sections of the React component into a PDF.  Significant functionality was added to handle sending the generated PDF via email to multiple clients using `userService.postFormData`.  Error handling and loading states are included. The component also uses SweetAlert2 for user interactions (confirmations and report summary displays).  The code uses Promises and `setTimeout` to ensure data fetching and rendering are complete before proceeding with PDF generation and sending.


`SearchesChart.tsx` (12:52:40 PM): This component renders three different charts (bar charts for media type and beat counts, and a donut chart for city counts) using `react-apexcharts`.  The component takes `data` as a prop and uses `useEffect` to process this data into chart-ready formats for `react-apexcharts`. Each chart has specific styling and formatting applied. The code handles cases where `data` might be undefined.  The charts are presented within a styled section with a class name `pdf-section`, suggesting integration with the PDF generation in `GenerateReport.tsx`.


## 4:30:52 PM
The log shows significant changes across several files within the `Skribe-Backend` project, primarily focused on the `BrandMonthlyReport` and `Reports` pages.  The updates span from 2:11 PM to 4:30 PM on June 12th, 2025.

**`Header.tsx` (2:11:15 PM):** This file contains the header component for the `BrandMonthlyReport` page.  It's a functional component (`React.FC`) displaying a header with tabs for "Brand Summary," "Narratives," and "Usage & Performance," allowing for tab switching via the `onTabChange` prop. The styling uses Tailwind CSS.


**`GenerateReport.tsx` (2:12:19 PM & 3:59:30 PM):** This component handles report generation and sending.  It fetches data from various API endpoints (`/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/MonthlyReportSearchGraph`, etc.) using `userService`.  The initial version lacks the `Narratives` component. A noteworthy feature is the use of `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` to convert sections of the report into a PDF for download.  The later update at 3:59:30 PM adds the `Narratives` component to the report generation process. The component also includes functionality to send the report via email to multiple clients, handling both success and failure scenarios using `sweetalert2` for user feedback.

**`BrandSummary.tsx` (2:19:31 PM, 3:39:22 PM, 3:40:10 PM, 3:45:58 PM, 3:52:40 PM, 4:02:46 PM, 4:13:41 PM, 4:14:14 PM, 4:15:47 PM, 4:16:15 PM, 4:16:32 PM, 4:16:58 PM, 4:19:46 PM, 4:20:25 PM, 4:23:20 PM, 4:23:44 PM, 4:25:29 PM, 4:26:52 PM, 4:27:21 PM, 4:27:42 PM, 4:29:06 PM, 4:29:50 PM):** This file underwent extensive revision.  It initially contained commented-out code showing an earlier version of the component.  The changes reflect a shift from using placeholder components to a dynamic component utilizing data from an API (or dummy data when the API fails) and `ReactApexCharts` for rendering charts.  Many of these revisions involved refinements to styling, layout (`grid` system), chart types (bar, donut, radialBar), and data handling, with numerous intermediate versions and commented-out sections. The final version includes a logo and dynamic data fetching and rendering with error handling.

**`TopPublications.tsx` (3:50:16 PM, 3:50:28 PM, 3:52:15 PM, 3:55:53 PM, 3:57:13 PM):** This chart component, showing top publications, was adjusted multiple times.  Initial versions used  `ReactApexChart`, and revisions focus on styling adjustments (sizes, margins), chart height, and responsiveness. The data displayed was also modified from an initial set to a new set of publication names and values.

**`TopJournalists.tsx` (3:53:27 PM):** This component displays top journalists, using a visual representation of journalists with their outlets.  It utilizes styling and positioning to create a visually appealing layout.

**`QualityOfMentions.tsx` (3:53:47 PM):** This component renders a donut chart displaying the quality of mentions, utilizing `ReactApexChart`.


**`SentimentScore.tsx` (3:54:02 PM):** This component uses a radial bar chart (`ReactApexChart`) to show the sentiment score, including a visual representation of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.


**`RegionalSplit.tsx` (3:54:17 PM):** This component presents a donut chart showing the regional split of mentions, using `ReactApexChart`.


**`Narratives.tsx` (4:00:24 PM & 4:30:12 PM):** This component shows narratives and includes a `TimelineChart` and a commented-out `NewsArticleList`.  There were no significant changes between the two timestamps.


The overall pattern in the code changes is a strong focus on creating visually appealing and informative charts for the monthly report, implemented with `ReactApexCharts`, and integrating these charts into a comprehensive report generation and email sending system.  The numerous revisions to `BrandSummary.tsx` suggest an iterative development process with several attempts at optimal design and implementation.


## 5:30:38 PM
The log shows several modifications across multiple files within the `Skribe-Backend` project, primarily focusing on report generation and display.

The most significant changes occurred between 4:32 PM and 5:17 PM on June 12th, 2025, within the `GenerateReport.tsx` and `Narratives.tsx` components.  `GenerateReport.tsx` underwent substantial updates, adding functionalities for fetching data from multiple API endpoints using `userService`, generating PDF reports using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`, and implementing email functionality to send reports to clients.  The code also includes robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms using `sweetalert2` for confirmation dialogs and `Alert` components.

The `NewsArticleList.tsx` file was updated at 4:35 PM to replace `lucide-react` icons with `material-icons`, simplifying the import statements.  This change likely reflects a library switch for UI components.

The `Narratives.tsx` component saw numerous revisions throughout the logged period (4:38 PM - 5:17 PM).  Initially, it displayed a simple header and contained `TimelineChart` and `NewsArticleList` components.  Later revisions involved adding a Skribe logo to the header and refactoring to include custom SVG timeline chart instead of using `react-apexcharts`. Finally, the component was commented out completely.

The `TimelineChart.tsx` file was modified multiple times (4:39 PM, 4:56 PM, and 5:01 PM). These changes focused on optimizing the chart's appearance, reducing height, and removing unnecessary features like zooming for better PDF rendering. The component also switched from `react-apexcharts` to `recharts` library for the charting functionality at around 5:04 PM.

A recurring theme is the use of various libraries for UI elements and charts, along with  a shift from `react-apexcharts` to `recharts` during the later modifications. There was also a large scale change in the `Narratives.tsx` file where the component implementation changed from using a custom svg to using `recharts` and finally it was commented out.


## 6:30:47 PM
The log shows several code modifications across two files: `BrandSummary.tsx` and `Narratives.tsx`.  Both files are React components and undergo substantial changes between 5:34 PM and 6:10 PM, primarily involving the implementation of charts using `react-apexcharts` and styling updates using Tailwind CSS.

**`BrandSummary.tsx` Changes:**

The initial version (5:34 PM) was a simple component rendering placeholder components for charts. Subsequent updates (5:35 PM and 5:36 PM) show no significant changes in the code.  The final version (5:37 PM and 5:37:47 PM) implements four charts (bar, donut, donut, radialBar) using `react-apexcharts`. Dummy data is included for development purposes.  The component is also significantly restyled, adding a logo, padding, and more structured layout using Tailwind classes.  The key change here is the transition from a placeholder to a fully functional chart component with comprehensive styling.


**`Narratives.tsx` Changes:**

The `Narratives.tsx` file shows a similar pattern. Initially (5:38 PM), it was a placeholder component. The subsequent updates (5:39 PM to 5:59 PM)  show multiple iterations, with the final version (6:00 PM) displaying a significantly different structure.  The commented-out code suggests an earlier attempt to use `recharts` for a line chart. The active code uses a different approach, possibly due to limitations of `recharts`. The final version displays a list of articles with styling and color-coding based on the sentiment category ('Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral').  The  changes focus on displaying article data and using Tailwind CSS for styling.  The multiple commits suggest iterative improvements to the layout and presentation of the article information.

**`Narratives2.tsx` Changes:**

A new component, `Narratives2.tsx`, appears at 6:03:04 PM. This component renders narrative data, including positive and negative sentiment information, from a data array. The component shows improvement in the structure, presentation and layout of news articles, unlike the initial `Narratives.tsx` component.


**Recurring Elements:**

*   Consistent use of Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   Several commits in quick succession for both files suggest iterative development and refinement of the UI.
*   Both files implement a header including a logo, suggesting a consistent design approach for the brand's monthly report.
*  Both files includes commented-out code and multiple iterations of the same component, indicating a significant redesign of the component structure and logic.

The `GenerateReport.tsx` file is used to generate the PDF report, using `jspdf` and `html2canvas` libraries. It fetches data from an API (`userService`) and dynamically constructs the report. There are also functions for sending the generated PDF report via email, with functionality to send reports to multiple clients simultaneously. The final change at 6:04:27 PM updates the `Narratives` component import to include `Narratives2`.

In summary, the code changes reflect significant development and improvement in the user interface of the brand's monthly report, incorporating interactive charts, and efficient PDF generation and email distribution.


## 7:53:32 PM
The log shows modifications to React components responsible for displaying brand summary and narrative data.  The `TimeLine.tsx` component, displaying an area chart, underwent several revisions between 7:07 PM and 7:11 PM on June 12, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on reducing the chart's height and associated font sizes for a more compact layout.  The zoom toolbar was also hidden in a later revision.

The `NarrativeModal.tsx` component, which displays narrative details, was modified multiple times between 7:10 PM and 7:53 PM.  The main changes involved adjustments to the component's styling, specifically border-radius and the removal of a header section.  The data structure for the narratives remained largely consistent, always displaying a single positive narrative about Groww receiving CCI approval.  There were also multiple nearly identical versions of `NarrativeModal.tsx` created in quick succession, suggesting experimentation with the component's structure and layout.

Finally,  `BrandSummary.tsx` underwent extensive revisions between 7:16 PM and 7:53 PM.  This component displays several charts using the `react-apexcharts` library, presenting data on top publications, top journalists, quality of mentions, regional split of mentions, and sentiment score.  The changes involved significant styling adjustments,  height and width modifications to the charts,  and a change of a color code in one of the charts.  The component uses dummy data  which is consistent across all revisions.  The changes appear to be focused on improving the visual presentation and layout of the charts within the component. A recurring theme is the use of similar color palettes (`#01438D`, `#0087FF`, `#239DFF`) across all components.


## 8:53:43 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `BrandSummary.tsx` component between 7:53 PM and 8:48 PM on June 12, 2025.  The component renders several charts using the `react-apexcharts` library, displaying data related to brand performance.  The data is sourced either from a prop (`data`) or fallback dummy data.

The most significant changes involved styling and minor adjustments to the chart configurations:

* **8:01 PM:** Updates to the `publicationsChartData` options to display the x and y axis borders and ticks,  making the grid lines solid.

* **8:03 PM:**  The `publicationsChartData`'s y-axis is modified to include `tickAmount: 3` and to explicitly show the axis border with color `#000`.

* **8:04 PM:** A new file, `SearchesChart.tsx`, is added, containing code for a different chart component visualizing media type, beat, and city counts.  This file uses `react-apexcharts` similarly to `BrandSummary.tsx`.

* **8:04 PM - 8:08 PM:** More styling changes are applied to `BrandSummary.tsx` charts;  These affect border visibility, grid lines, and bar/column styles (borderRadius and columnWidth).  Axis borders and ticks are repeatedly modified.

* **8:21 PM - 8:27 PM:** Further refinement of chart styling, including minor adjustments to the `qualityChartData` height and `donut` size within `plotOptions`.  The font size of the "Total Mentions" label in the `qualityChartData` is changed.


* **8:27 PM - 8:30 PM:** The  `qualityChartData`'s  `formatter` function in `total` dataLabels is simplified;  The `style` property is added to the `formatter` function in `total` dataLabels of `qualityChartData` to set font size and weight for "1000".

* **8:30 PM - 8:31 PM:** The `qualityChartData` height is increased from 150 to 180. The donut hole size is adjusted.

* **8:31 PM - 8:33 PM:** A border is added to the "Quality of Mentions" chart section (`border border-red-500`). Minor styling changes are applied to the Quality of Mentions section.


* **8:33 PM - 8:35 PM:** The border is removed from the "Quality of Mentions" chart's container.  The layout of the "Quality of Mentions" legend is adjusted to be `flex justify-between items-center`.

* **8:35 PM - 8:38 PM:**  The `qualityChartData`  `dataLabels` are adjusted, showing the `name`  and removing the `value`.  The `legend` is set to `show: false`.

* **8:38 PM - 8:39 PM:**  More commenting and restructuring for improved readability.

* **8:39 PM - 8:40 PM:** The `plotOptions` for `qualityChartData` are adjusted to show `name` and `total` labels, with specific styling applied.

* **8:40 PM - 8:43 PM:**  No significant code changes are observed;  There might have been minor edits, but the net effect is not visible.

* **8:43 PM - 8:45 PM:** The `regionalChartData`'s `donut` size is adjusted to '50%'.

* **8:45 PM - 8:46 PM:**  The `regionalChartData`'s height is increased to 150px.

* **8:46 PM - 8:47 PM:**  The labels within the `dummyData` for `quality` are changed from `High`, `Medium`, `Low` to `Active`, `Medium`, `Low`.

* **8:47 PM - 8:48 PM:** The `dummyData` for `quality` is further updated; `Medium` is replaced with `Passive`.   The color for the 'Active' type is changed.

* **8:48 PM:**  The color for `Passive` type in `dummyData` is updated.

In summary, the majority of changes focused on iterative improvements to the visual presentation of the charts within the `BrandSummary.tsx` component, with some data label and chart height adjustments. The `SearchesChart.tsx` component represents a separate addition.  The changes show a pattern of iterative refinement based on design feedback or visual improvements.
