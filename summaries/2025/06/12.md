# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 9:29:11 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `AddJournalist.tsx` file, all on June 11th, 2025.  The code is a React component for adding journalist information.  There are no substantive changes between the various commits, only minor variations likely due to auto-formatting or very small edits not impacting the core functionality.

The component uses several React libraries (`react-router-dom`, `react-redux`, `react-select`, `formik`, `sweetalert2`), indicating a reliance on routing, state management, form handling, and alert displays.

The code heavily interacts with a `userService` for fetching and posting data, suggesting communication with a backend API.  The API endpoints used include `/userpreference/geoStateCity`, `/GetCitiesByStateIds`, `/outlet`, `/supplements`, `/shows`, `/outletsupplements`, `/outletshows`, and `/subBeat`. These endpoints are likely used to populate select options and handle form submissions.

The component includes a modal (`ModalComponent`) and dynamically renders components (`Supplement`, `Title`, `Shows`) based on user interaction, indicating a sophisticated user interface for managing journalist details.  The data is managed using several `useState` hooks, suggesting a component that handles a significant amount of data and state.

The `validationSchema` uses `Yup` to validate the journalist's name, ensuring it doesn't start with certain titles or contain abbreviations, and enforcing proper casing.  This indicates a focus on data integrity.  The numerous API calls suggest a complex process for data management.  The repeated code structure across commits implies iterative development and refinements, with the core functionality remaining unchanged.


## 11:29:09 AM
The primary change on June 12th, 2025, at 11:25:03 AM,  involved the `api.ts` file within the `Skribe-Backend` project. This file defines an Axios instance for making API calls.  The key update focuses on enhanced error handling and token refresh mechanisms.

Specifically, the `api.ts` file now includes:

* **Multiple base URLs:**  The code shows commented-out base URLs (`localhost`, `beta.goskribe.com`, `www.goskribe.com`), suggesting ongoing development or testing across different environments.  The currently active base URL appears to be dynamically determined using `getBaseURL()`.

* **Improved token management:** The code implements a robust mechanism for handling 401 (Unauthorized) errors.  If an access token expires, it attempts to refresh the token using a `/Authenticate/refresh-token` endpoint. If the refresh fails, the user is redirected to the login page (`/`). The implementation uses `isRefreshing` and `refreshAccessTokenPromise` to prevent race conditions during token refresh attempts.


* **Network error handling:** The code now includes a more user-friendly alert for network errors, utilizing a component called `Alert`.

* **Header management:**  The axios instance sets headers including "Content-Type" (initially set to `application/json` with commented-out `multipart/form-data` suggesting potential future support for file uploads) and "X-Source-App".

In essence, this commit significantly improved the resilience and security of API interactions by implementing automatic token refresh and more informative error handling.


## 1:10:01 PM
The log shows updates to two React components on June 12th, 2025.

`GenerateReport.tsx` (12:50:41 PM): This component was significantly updated.  The changes center around generating and sending PDF reports.  The component now fetches data from multiple API endpoints using `userService.get` for various report sections (monthly report details, search graphs, campaign graphs, user performance, top campaigns, and month comparisons). It uses `html2canvas` and `jsPDF` to convert sections of the React component into a PDF.  Significant functionality was added to handle sending the generated PDF via email to multiple clients using `userService.postFormData`.  Error handling and loading states are included. The component also uses SweetAlert2 for user interactions (confirmations and report summary displays).  The code uses Promises and `setTimeout` to ensure data fetching and rendering are complete before proceeding with PDF generation and sending.


`SearchesChart.tsx` (12:52:40 PM): This component renders three different charts (bar charts for media type and beat counts, and a donut chart for city counts) using `react-apexcharts`.  The component takes `data` as a prop and uses `useEffect` to process this data into chart-ready formats for `react-apexcharts`. Each chart has specific styling and formatting applied. The code handles cases where `data` might be undefined.  The charts are presented within a styled section with a class name `pdf-section`, suggesting integration with the PDF generation in `GenerateReport.tsx`.


## 4:30:52 PM
The log shows significant changes across several files within the `Skribe-Backend` project, primarily focused on the `BrandMonthlyReport` and `Reports` pages.  The updates span from 2:11 PM to 4:30 PM on June 12th, 2025.

**`Header.tsx` (2:11:15 PM):** This file contains the header component for the `BrandMonthlyReport` page.  It's a functional component (`React.FC`) displaying a header with tabs for "Brand Summary," "Narratives," and "Usage & Performance," allowing for tab switching via the `onTabChange` prop. The styling uses Tailwind CSS.


**`GenerateReport.tsx` (2:12:19 PM & 3:59:30 PM):** This component handles report generation and sending.  It fetches data from various API endpoints (`/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/MonthlyReportSearchGraph`, etc.) using `userService`.  The initial version lacks the `Narratives` component. A noteworthy feature is the use of `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` to convert sections of the report into a PDF for download.  The later update at 3:59:30 PM adds the `Narratives` component to the report generation process. The component also includes functionality to send the report via email to multiple clients, handling both success and failure scenarios using `sweetalert2` for user feedback.

**`BrandSummary.tsx` (2:19:31 PM, 3:39:22 PM, 3:40:10 PM, 3:45:58 PM, 3:52:40 PM, 4:02:46 PM, 4:13:41 PM, 4:14:14 PM, 4:15:47 PM, 4:16:15 PM, 4:16:32 PM, 4:16:58 PM, 4:19:46 PM, 4:20:25 PM, 4:23:20 PM, 4:23:44 PM, 4:25:29 PM, 4:26:52 PM, 4:27:21 PM, 4:27:42 PM, 4:29:06 PM, 4:29:50 PM):** This file underwent extensive revision.  It initially contained commented-out code showing an earlier version of the component.  The changes reflect a shift from using placeholder components to a dynamic component utilizing data from an API (or dummy data when the API fails) and `ReactApexCharts` for rendering charts.  Many of these revisions involved refinements to styling, layout (`grid` system), chart types (bar, donut, radialBar), and data handling, with numerous intermediate versions and commented-out sections. The final version includes a logo and dynamic data fetching and rendering with error handling.

**`TopPublications.tsx` (3:50:16 PM, 3:50:28 PM, 3:52:15 PM, 3:55:53 PM, 3:57:13 PM):** This chart component, showing top publications, was adjusted multiple times.  Initial versions used  `ReactApexChart`, and revisions focus on styling adjustments (sizes, margins), chart height, and responsiveness. The data displayed was also modified from an initial set to a new set of publication names and values.

**`TopJournalists.tsx` (3:53:27 PM):** This component displays top journalists, using a visual representation of journalists with their outlets.  It utilizes styling and positioning to create a visually appealing layout.

**`QualityOfMentions.tsx` (3:53:47 PM):** This component renders a donut chart displaying the quality of mentions, utilizing `ReactApexChart`.


**`SentimentScore.tsx` (3:54:02 PM):** This component uses a radial bar chart (`ReactApexChart`) to show the sentiment score, including a visual representation of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.


**`RegionalSplit.tsx` (3:54:17 PM):** This component presents a donut chart showing the regional split of mentions, using `ReactApexChart`.


**`Narratives.tsx` (4:00:24 PM & 4:30:12 PM):** This component shows narratives and includes a `TimelineChart` and a commented-out `NewsArticleList`.  There were no significant changes between the two timestamps.


The overall pattern in the code changes is a strong focus on creating visually appealing and informative charts for the monthly report, implemented with `ReactApexCharts`, and integrating these charts into a comprehensive report generation and email sending system.  The numerous revisions to `BrandSummary.tsx` suggest an iterative development process with several attempts at optimal design and implementation.


## 5:30:38 PM
The log shows several modifications across multiple files within the `Skribe-Backend` project, primarily focusing on report generation and display.

The most significant changes occurred between 4:32 PM and 5:17 PM on June 12th, 2025, within the `GenerateReport.tsx` and `Narratives.tsx` components.  `GenerateReport.tsx` underwent substantial updates, adding functionalities for fetching data from multiple API endpoints using `userService`, generating PDF reports using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`, and implementing email functionality to send reports to clients.  The code also includes robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms using `sweetalert2` for confirmation dialogs and `Alert` components.

The `NewsArticleList.tsx` file was updated at 4:35 PM to replace `lucide-react` icons with `material-icons`, simplifying the import statements.  This change likely reflects a library switch for UI components.

The `Narratives.tsx` component saw numerous revisions throughout the logged period (4:38 PM - 5:17 PM).  Initially, it displayed a simple header and contained `TimelineChart` and `NewsArticleList` components.  Later revisions involved adding a Skribe logo to the header and refactoring to include custom SVG timeline chart instead of using `react-apexcharts`. Finally, the component was commented out completely.

The `TimelineChart.tsx` file was modified multiple times (4:39 PM, 4:56 PM, and 5:01 PM). These changes focused on optimizing the chart's appearance, reducing height, and removing unnecessary features like zooming for better PDF rendering. The component also switched from `react-apexcharts` to `recharts` library for the charting functionality at around 5:04 PM.

A recurring theme is the use of various libraries for UI elements and charts, along with  a shift from `react-apexcharts` to `recharts` during the later modifications. There was also a large scale change in the `Narratives.tsx` file where the component implementation changed from using a custom svg to using `recharts` and finally it was commented out.
