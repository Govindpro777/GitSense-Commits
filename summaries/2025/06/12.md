# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 9:29:11 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `AddJournalist.tsx` file, all on June 11th, 2025.  The code is a React component for adding journalist information.  There are no substantive changes between the various commits, only minor variations likely due to auto-formatting or very small edits not impacting the core functionality.

The component uses several React libraries (`react-router-dom`, `react-redux`, `react-select`, `formik`, `sweetalert2`), indicating a reliance on routing, state management, form handling, and alert displays.

The code heavily interacts with a `userService` for fetching and posting data, suggesting communication with a backend API.  The API endpoints used include `/userpreference/geoStateCity`, `/GetCitiesByStateIds`, `/outlet`, `/supplements`, `/shows`, `/outletsupplements`, `/outletshows`, and `/subBeat`. These endpoints are likely used to populate select options and handle form submissions.

The component includes a modal (`ModalComponent`) and dynamically renders components (`Supplement`, `Title`, `Shows`) based on user interaction, indicating a sophisticated user interface for managing journalist details.  The data is managed using several `useState` hooks, suggesting a component that handles a significant amount of data and state.

The `validationSchema` uses `Yup` to validate the journalist's name, ensuring it doesn't start with certain titles or contain abbreviations, and enforcing proper casing.  This indicates a focus on data integrity.  The numerous API calls suggest a complex process for data management.  The repeated code structure across commits implies iterative development and refinements, with the core functionality remaining unchanged.
