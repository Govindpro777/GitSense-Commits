# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 9:29:11 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `AddJournalist.tsx` file, all on June 11th, 2025.  The code is a React component for adding journalist information.  There are no substantive changes between the various commits, only minor variations likely due to auto-formatting or very small edits not impacting the core functionality.

The component uses several React libraries (`react-router-dom`, `react-redux`, `react-select`, `formik`, `sweetalert2`), indicating a reliance on routing, state management, form handling, and alert displays.

The code heavily interacts with a `userService` for fetching and posting data, suggesting communication with a backend API.  The API endpoints used include `/userpreference/geoStateCity`, `/GetCitiesByStateIds`, `/outlet`, `/supplements`, `/shows`, `/outletsupplements`, `/outletshows`, and `/subBeat`. These endpoints are likely used to populate select options and handle form submissions.

The component includes a modal (`ModalComponent`) and dynamically renders components (`Supplement`, `Title`, `Shows`) based on user interaction, indicating a sophisticated user interface for managing journalist details.  The data is managed using several `useState` hooks, suggesting a component that handles a significant amount of data and state.

The `validationSchema` uses `Yup` to validate the journalist's name, ensuring it doesn't start with certain titles or contain abbreviations, and enforcing proper casing.  This indicates a focus on data integrity.  The numerous API calls suggest a complex process for data management.  The repeated code structure across commits implies iterative development and refinements, with the core functionality remaining unchanged.

The primary change on June 12th, 2025, at 11:25:03 AM,  involved the `api.ts` file within the `Skribe-Backend` project. This file defines an Axios instance for making API calls.  The key update focuses on enhanced error handling and token refresh mechanisms.

Specifically, the `api.ts` file now includes:

* **Multiple base URLs:**  The code shows commented-out base URLs (`localhost`, `beta.goskribe.com`, `www.goskribe.com`), suggesting ongoing development or testing across different environments.  The currently active base URL appears to be dynamically determined using `getBaseURL()`.

* **Improved token management:** The code implements a robust mechanism for handling 401 (Unauthorized) errors.  If an access token expires, it attempts to refresh the token using a `/Authenticate/refresh-token` endpoint. If the refresh fails, the user is redirected to the login page (`/`). The implementation uses `isRefreshing` and `refreshAccessTokenPromise` to prevent race conditions during token refresh attempts.


* **Network error handling:** The code now includes a more user-friendly alert for network errors, utilizing a component called `Alert`.

* **Header management:**  The axios instance sets headers including "Content-Type" (initially set to `application/json` with commented-out `multipart/form-data` suggesting potential future support for file uploads) and "X-Source-App".

In essence, this commit significantly improved the resilience and security of API interactions by implementing automatic token refresh and more informative error handling.
