# Activity Summary for 6/10/2025

## 12:26:14 AM
The log shows several revisions to React components for a Learning Management System (LMS) frontend.

The `Contactus.js` file underwent significant styling changes between 11:35 PM and 11:50 PM on June 9th, 2025.  The initial version used a more verbose Tailwind CSS styling approach. The later version adopted a more concise and potentially more maintainable style, switching to a different color palette and layout. The form's functionality, including validation and submission, remained unchanged. A further, minor revision at 11:50:47 PM reverted the styling back to the initial, more verbose Tailwind approach. Finally, at 12:23:36 AM on June 10th, 2025, the entire `Contactus.js` file was commented out.

The `DeliverMonetize.js` file was modified multiple times on June 10th, 2025. The initial version (12:06:49 AM) was a commented-out component that used `next/image` for image rendering and a carousel effect for mobile view.  Subsequent revisions at 12:13:23 AM and 12:18:24 AM replaced the static card data with a fetch request to an API endpoint (`/v1/demos/getAllDemoCourse`) to retrieve course data dynamically.  Error handling and loading states were added to improve the user experience. The changes reflect a transition from statically defined content to dynamic data fetching.  The commented-out sections suggest iterative development and experimentation with different approaches.  The core functionality (displaying courses, a call to action) remains.
The final version utilizes `axiosInstance` for API calls.


The `FreeLMS.js` file, modified at 12:25:18 AM on June 10th, 2025, introduces animation using `framer-motion` for smooth content transitions. It displays information about a free LMS demo and includes conditional rendering based on user login status. This component appears to be a standalone promotional section, focused on user acquisition.
