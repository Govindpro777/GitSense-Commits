# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 12:25:56 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx`  between 11:27 AM and 12:24 PM on June 23, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be the implementation of file upload functionality.

Initially, the component lacked file upload capabilities.  Subsequent revisions introduced state variables (`displayImage`, `storeImages`, `error`) to manage uploaded files,  an `ATTACH_URL` constant (likely a placeholder for an API endpoint), and a `FileUpload` function to handle file selection.

The `FileUpload` function evolved significantly throughout the edits.  Early versions lacked validation. Later versions incorporated checks for file size (maximum 5MB) and allowed file types (jpg, jpeg, png, pdf), initially using `alert` for notifications and finally using a `useNotification` hook for improved user feedback.  The function also incorporates a limit on the total number of files (5).

The most significant changes occurred between 11:27 AM and 11:37 AM, marking the initial addition of file upload functionality, and again around 11:43 AM when a more robust file validation was introduced. Further refinements took place to utilize the `useNotification` hook for error handling, improving user experience.  The final version at 12:24 PM shows a completed file upload feature with comprehensive validation and error handling through notifications.  There are no changes to the core campaign management functionality  throughout the observed edits.


## 1:26:05 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` between 12:27 PM and 1:24 PM on June 23, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is enhancing the file upload functionality and improving the UI/UX.

Initially, `CampaignOutreach.jsx` was a React component with basic functionality for managing campaign deliverables and a campaign brief using `ReactQuill`.  It included dropdowns for content type, duration, and quantity.  A simple table displayed the deliverables, and there was a basic file upload, email preview, and mail sending functionality.

The most significant changes happened between 12:49 PM and 1:13 PM.  During this period, several improvements were made:

* **File Upload Enhancement:** The file upload was significantly improved.  It now uses the `useNotification` hook to provide feedback to the user about file type and size restrictions (max 5MB, JPG, PNG, PDF). The component now displays previews of uploaded files (including PDF previews).  The `FileUpload` function was added to handle file uploads, validation, and display of previews. A `handleDelete` function was also added to allow users to remove uploaded files.

* **UI/UX Improvements:** The UI was refined with the addition of a close button (`IoClose`) to close the component. The layout of the file upload section was redesigned for better presentation and usability, moving from a less intuitive placement to a `flex flex-wrap` structure.  The "Preview Email" button was disabled until a valid campaign brief is entered.

* **Email Preview Component Interaction:**  `EmailPreview.jsx` was modified to accept `attachedImages`, `campaignBrief`, and `deliverables` as props, dynamically generating the email content based on these values.  This ensures the email preview reflects the latest data from `CampaignOutreach.jsx`.  The attachment preview in `EmailPreview.jsx` was improved to show a placeholder for PDFs.

The changes from 1:13 PM onwards involved minor adjustments to the UI layout, mainly focusing on the positioning and styling of the file upload section and attachment previews within the `CampaignOutreach` component. The final version has a refined file upload system with previews, improved error handling, and a more user-friendly layout.  The close button and improved `EmailPreview` interaction enhances the overall user experience.  There is no evidence of any recurring problematic elements in the code, aside from the numerous commented-out code blocks which could be removed for clarity.
