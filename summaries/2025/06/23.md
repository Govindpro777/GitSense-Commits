# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 12:25:56 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx`  between 11:27 AM and 12:24 PM on June 23, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be the implementation of file upload functionality.

Initially, the component lacked file upload capabilities.  Subsequent revisions introduced state variables (`displayImage`, `storeImages`, `error`) to manage uploaded files,  an `ATTACH_URL` constant (likely a placeholder for an API endpoint), and a `FileUpload` function to handle file selection.

The `FileUpload` function evolved significantly throughout the edits.  Early versions lacked validation. Later versions incorporated checks for file size (maximum 5MB) and allowed file types (jpg, jpeg, png, pdf), initially using `alert` for notifications and finally using a `useNotification` hook for improved user feedback.  The function also incorporates a limit on the total number of files (5).

The most significant changes occurred between 11:27 AM and 11:37 AM, marking the initial addition of file upload functionality, and again around 11:43 AM when a more robust file validation was introduced. Further refinements took place to utilize the `useNotification` hook for error handling, improving user experience.  The final version at 12:24 PM shows a completed file upload feature with comprehensive validation and error handling through notifications.  There are no changes to the core campaign management functionality  throughout the observed edits.


## 1:26:05 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` between 12:27 PM and 1:24 PM on June 23, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is enhancing the file upload functionality and improving the UI/UX.

Initially, `CampaignOutreach.jsx` was a React component with basic functionality for managing campaign deliverables and a campaign brief using `ReactQuill`.  It included dropdowns for content type, duration, and quantity.  A simple table displayed the deliverables, and there was a basic file upload, email preview, and mail sending functionality.

The most significant changes happened between 12:49 PM and 1:13 PM.  During this period, several improvements were made:

* **File Upload Enhancement:** The file upload was significantly improved.  It now uses the `useNotification` hook to provide feedback to the user about file type and size restrictions (max 5MB, JPG, PNG, PDF). The component now displays previews of uploaded files (including PDF previews).  The `FileUpload` function was added to handle file uploads, validation, and display of previews. A `handleDelete` function was also added to allow users to remove uploaded files.

* **UI/UX Improvements:** The UI was refined with the addition of a close button (`IoClose`) to close the component. The layout of the file upload section was redesigned for better presentation and usability, moving from a less intuitive placement to a `flex flex-wrap` structure.  The "Preview Email" button was disabled until a valid campaign brief is entered.

* **Email Preview Component Interaction:**  `EmailPreview.jsx` was modified to accept `attachedImages`, `campaignBrief`, and `deliverables` as props, dynamically generating the email content based on these values.  This ensures the email preview reflects the latest data from `CampaignOutreach.jsx`.  The attachment preview in `EmailPreview.jsx` was improved to show a placeholder for PDFs.

The changes from 1:13 PM onwards involved minor adjustments to the UI layout, mainly focusing on the positioning and styling of the file upload section and attachment previews within the `CampaignOutreach` component. The final version has a refined file upload system with previews, improved error handling, and a more user-friendly layout.  The close button and improved `EmailPreview` interaction enhances the overall user experience.  There is no evidence of any recurring problematic elements in the code, aside from the numerous commented-out code blocks which could be removed for clarity.


## 2:26:02 PM
The log shows several modifications to two React component files: `CampaignOutreach.jsx` and `EmailPreview.jsx`.  The `CampaignOutreach.jsx` component, updated around 1:27 PM on June 23rd, 2025, is a form for managing campaign outreach. It includes features for selecting content type, duration, and quantity, adding and deleting deliverables, uploading files (with validation for type and size), displaying image previews, and previewing/sending emails.  The file underwent several minor updates in quick succession (between 1:27 PM and 1:29 PM), likely reflecting iterative development. The most significant change added `attachedImages`, `campaignBrief`, and `deliverables` props to the `EmailPreview` component call.


The `EmailPreview.jsx` component, initially a basic email preview with placeholder text, evolved significantly throughout the afternoon.  Early versions (1:31 PM - 1:32 PM) were commented out and then replaced. The final version (after multiple iterations between 1:31 PM and 2:08 PM), displays an email preview that dynamically generates content based on props received from `CampaignOutreach.jsx`, including attached images, campaign brief, and deliverables.  The initial content is dynamically adjusted based on the presence of deliverables, campaign brief, or attachments.  Several changes focused on the display and management of attached images within the email preview; a "remove attachment" functionality was added (although its functionality is currently limited to logging to the console) and styling improved.  The placement of the attachment display was also adjusted, moving it below the email content in the final version.  The repeated commenting out and rewriting suggests a refactor or substantial redesign of the component.

A new component, `SocialSummary.jsx`, was added at 2:17 PM and then substantially revised at 2:21 PM and 2:23 PM.  This component renders a table summarizing social media campaigns, allowing filtering by status, search term, and date range.  The component uses mock data for demonstration purposes. The initial version was extremely basic, then it was updated to a functional component with filtering and interactive elements.


Finally, a new Next.js page, `social-summary\page.jsx`, was created at 2:22 PM to render the `SocialSummary` component.


## 3:25:58 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EmailPreview.jsx` and one revision to `SocialSummary.jsx` on June 23, 2025.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent significant changes to the `emailContent` state variable between 2:43:10 PM and 2:58:20 PM.  Initially, it was a simple placeholder email. It was then iteratively refined, incorporating a table format to display campaign deliverables and finally reverting to a simpler structure,  removing the table in favor of a bulleted list for deliverables. The final version uses a simpler email template focusing on deliverables breakdown.  Around 2:49:40 PM, the rendering of `emailContent` changed from a `<p>` tag to a `<pre>` tag to better handle the formatting of the email content, likely to preserve the tabular structure.  Further modifications around  2:54:13 PM and 2:55:34 PM adjusted the styling and max-width of the textarea and pre-formatted text. Finally, at 2:56:50 PM and 2:57:31 PM, the component reverted to using a `<p>` tag for the non-editing state and removed the table structure entirely.


The `SocialSummary.jsx` component was updated primarily for styling purposes, particularly between 3:19:17 PM and 3:23:48 PM. These changes focused on the styling of the status filter pills and the overall filter bar container, using rounded corners and consistent background colors.  There were no functional changes in the component's behavior.


## 4:26:01 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `EmailPreview.jsx` between 3:31 PM and 3:49 PM on June 23, 2025, primarily focusing on refining the email content's presentation and format.  The initial versions contained commented-out code and a placeholder email body.  Subsequent revisions introduced a formatted table within the email content, displaying campaign details.  There were several minor changes adjusting the font size (`text-[10px]`, `text-[9px]`) within the preview display, and modifications to styling elements for better presentation.  Finally, the `pre` tag displaying the email content was replaced with a `div` containing a `pre` tag with `whitespace-pre-wrap`, improving the rendering of the email content.  The final change at 3:49 PM slightly alters the table headers in the email content example.

The `SocialSummary.jsx` file underwent modifications between 4:02 PM and 4:18 PM on June 23, 2025.  The changes involved primarily styling and layout adjustments to a component displaying a campaign summary table.  The initial version had a basic table structure. Later revisions added styling using Tailwind CSS classes to improve the visual appearance of the table, header, filter bar, and overall layout.  Changes included adding padding, borders, shadows, and adjusting the height and width of elements.  The final changes focused on improving the styling of the table to make it more visually appealing and responsive.  There was also a removal of the table at one point and then it was added back in again.  The height of the main component was also adjusted to utilize most of the screen's vertical space.
