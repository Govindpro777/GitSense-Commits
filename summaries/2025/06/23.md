# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 12:25:56 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx`  between 11:27 AM and 12:24 PM on June 23, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be the implementation of file upload functionality.

Initially, the component lacked file upload capabilities.  Subsequent revisions introduced state variables (`displayImage`, `storeImages`, `error`) to manage uploaded files,  an `ATTACH_URL` constant (likely a placeholder for an API endpoint), and a `FileUpload` function to handle file selection.

The `FileUpload` function evolved significantly throughout the edits.  Early versions lacked validation. Later versions incorporated checks for file size (maximum 5MB) and allowed file types (jpg, jpeg, png, pdf), initially using `alert` for notifications and finally using a `useNotification` hook for improved user feedback.  The function also incorporates a limit on the total number of files (5).

The most significant changes occurred between 11:27 AM and 11:37 AM, marking the initial addition of file upload functionality, and again around 11:43 AM when a more robust file validation was introduced. Further refinements took place to utilize the `useNotification` hook for error handling, improving user experience.  The final version at 12:24 PM shows a completed file upload feature with comprehensive validation and error handling through notifications.  There are no changes to the core campaign management functionality  throughout the observed edits.
