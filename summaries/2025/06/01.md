# Activity Summary for 6/1/2025

## 10:58:08 AM
The log shows three edits to `Comments.js` within a short time frame on June 1st, 2025, between 10:29 AM and 10:31 AM.  The changes primarily focus on the `handleMenuItemClick` function within the `CommentCard` component.

The first two commits (10:29 AM and 10:30 AM) appear to be identical and may represent an accidental duplicate or a failed commit.

The third commit (10:31:02 AM) and fourth commit (10:31:38 AM) are also identical and include a significant addition to the `handleMenuItemClick` function.  This addition introduces an `else if` condition:  `else if (action === 'editReply' && !isTutorReply && review.replyBackByTutor) { onEditReply && onEditReply(review); }`. This allows for editing tutor replies even if the current user is not the tutor, provided `review.replyBackByTutor` is true.  There are no other functional changes between the three commits.  The code remains largely unchanged, only this conditional logic being added to allow for editing tutor replies under specific circumstances.
