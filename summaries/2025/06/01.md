# Activity Summary for 6/1/2025

## 10:58:08 AM
The log shows three edits to `Comments.js` within a short time frame on June 1st, 2025, between 10:29 AM and 10:31 AM.  The changes primarily focus on the `handleMenuItemClick` function within the `CommentCard` component.

The first two commits (10:29 AM and 10:30 AM) appear to be identical and may represent an accidental duplicate or a failed commit.

The third commit (10:31:02 AM) and fourth commit (10:31:38 AM) are also identical and include a significant addition to the `handleMenuItemClick` function.  This addition introduces an `else if` condition:  `else if (action === 'editReply' && !isTutorReply && review.replyBackByTutor) { onEditReply && onEditReply(review); }`. This allows for editing tutor replies even if the current user is not the tutor, provided `review.replyBackByTutor` is true.  There are no other functional changes between the three commits.  The code remains largely unchanged, only this conditional logic being added to allow for editing tutor replies under specific circumstances.


## 10:40:51 PM
The log shows three revisions of `Comments.js` on June 1st, 2025.  All revisions involve updates to the `CommentCard` and `CommentSection` components.  The changes primarily focus on the UI enhancements and improvements to the reply and featured review functionalities.

The first revision (11:06:20 AM) established the core components, featuring functionalities for displaying comments, user actions (edit, delete, reply), and toggling featured reviews.  The implementation uses several libraries like `date-fns`, `lucide-react`, `axiosInstance` for API calls, and `sonner` for toasts.

The second revision (11:06:57 AM) added an `<Image>` component within the reply button in the dropdown menu of `CommentCard`. This likely improved the visual representation of the reply action.

The third revision (11:07:48 AM) made a slight refinement.  The conditional rendering of the `<Image>` and `<MessageSquare>` within the reply button of the `CommentCard` was improved. The `MessageSquare` icon is now used for new replies, and the `<Image>` with edit icon is used for editing existing replies, thus creating a more visually clear distinction.  No other functional changes appear to have been made.  The overall structure and functionality remain consistent throughout all three revisions.
