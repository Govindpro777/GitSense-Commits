# Activity Summary for 6/18/2025

## 12:56:45 AM
The log shows a series of edits to the `StudentDashboard.jsx` and `PreviewCard.jsx` components, and `CoursePage.jsx` and `CoursePageStudent.jsx` components.  The `App.jsx` file underwent changes related to routing.  All changes occurred within a short time frame on June 18th, 2025, between 12:01 AM and 12:47 AM.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\page\student\StudentDashboard.jsx`**: This file contains a React component for a student dashboard.  The initial commits show the complete component, which displays a list of public courses. These courses are fetchable, searchable by course name, filterable by category (online/offline), and paginated.  A loading and error state are handled.  Around 12:01:51 AM and 12:03:58 AM, the Course Grid section was commented out, suggesting a temporary removal or restructuring of the course display. The component uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks extensively for state management and side effects.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\PreviewCard.jsx`**: This component renders individual course previews. It fetches teacher names and formats duration and price.  It utilizes memoization (`memo` and `useMemo`) for performance optimization. The significant change at 12:10:00 AM and 12:11:47 AM updates the `courseLink` to correctly direct to student course pages.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\courses\CoursePage.jsx`**: This file initially contained a fully commented-out React component for a course page. Then at 12:06:51 AM, the code was uncommented and significantly expanded. The component displays course details, statistics (mode, duration, price, sessions), teachers assigned to the course (with clickable rows), and an option to create assignments.  The component heavily utilizes React hooks and utilizes conditional rendering based on user roles.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\courses\CoursePageStudent.jsx`**: This file initially contained a fully commented-out React component, similar to `CoursePage.jsx`.  Subsequent commits (starting at 12:12:21 AM) progressively uncomment and develop the component until it is fully functional by 12:47:43 AM. The component shows a detailed course page specifically for students, including teacher selection for payment and integration with Razorpay for online payments.  The final version uses mock data for demonstration purposes but integrates authentication and API calls for order creation and payment verification.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\App.jsx`**:  The routing configuration was modified at 12:10:25 AM and 12:12:59 AM to accommodate the added `CoursePageStudent` component, directing student course page requests to the appropriate component. The final version has dedicated routes for student and teacher dashboards, course pages, and assignment creation, among other features.  The changes use React Router's lazy loading for improved performance.
