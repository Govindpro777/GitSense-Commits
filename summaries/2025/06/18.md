# Activity Summary for 6/18/2025

## 12:56:45 AM
The log shows a series of edits to the `StudentDashboard.jsx` and `PreviewCard.jsx` components, and `CoursePage.jsx` and `CoursePageStudent.jsx` components.  The `App.jsx` file underwent changes related to routing.  All changes occurred within a short time frame on June 18th, 2025, between 12:01 AM and 12:47 AM.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\page\student\StudentDashboard.jsx`**: This file contains a React component for a student dashboard.  The initial commits show the complete component, which displays a list of public courses. These courses are fetchable, searchable by course name, filterable by category (online/offline), and paginated.  A loading and error state are handled.  Around 12:01:51 AM and 12:03:58 AM, the Course Grid section was commented out, suggesting a temporary removal or restructuring of the course display. The component uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks extensively for state management and side effects.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\PreviewCard.jsx`**: This component renders individual course previews. It fetches teacher names and formats duration and price.  It utilizes memoization (`memo` and `useMemo`) for performance optimization. The significant change at 12:10:00 AM and 12:11:47 AM updates the `courseLink` to correctly direct to student course pages.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\courses\CoursePage.jsx`**: This file initially contained a fully commented-out React component for a course page. Then at 12:06:51 AM, the code was uncommented and significantly expanded. The component displays course details, statistics (mode, duration, price, sessions), teachers assigned to the course (with clickable rows), and an option to create assignments.  The component heavily utilizes React hooks and utilizes conditional rendering based on user roles.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\courses\CoursePageStudent.jsx`**: This file initially contained a fully commented-out React component, similar to `CoursePage.jsx`.  Subsequent commits (starting at 12:12:21 AM) progressively uncomment and develop the component until it is fully functional by 12:47:43 AM. The component shows a detailed course page specifically for students, including teacher selection for payment and integration with Razorpay for online payments.  The final version uses mock data for demonstration purposes but integrates authentication and API calls for order creation and payment verification.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\App.jsx`**:  The routing configuration was modified at 12:10:25 AM and 12:12:59 AM to accommodate the added `CoursePageStudent` component, directing student course page requests to the appropriate component. The final version has dedicated routes for student and teacher dashboards, course pages, and assignment creation, among other features.  The changes use React Router's lazy loading for improved performance.


## 1:14:56 PM
The log shows a series of code modifications primarily focused on `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\NEXT JS SKRIBE\Skribe-Frontend\src\components\Social\SocialComponents\Create.jsx`. This file underwent extensive revisions between 12:28 PM and 1:14 PM on June 18, 2025.  The initial changes involved replacing the component's name from `Create` to `CampaignForm` and significantly expanding its functionality.  The final version represents a styled React component for creating a campaign, featuring input fields for title, start and end dates, budget, brand name, brand goals, and a description with a character limit.  The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes inline styles for specific color and background settings.  The changes also involved a shift from using `lucide-react` icons to `react-icons/io5`.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\NEXT JS SKRIBE\Skribe-Frontend\src\app\(AfterLoginPages)\(socials)\social\page.jsx` also saw changes. Initially, it imported and rendered a `Twitter` component (12:17 PM). This was later updated to import and render the `Create` component (then `CampaignForm`), reflecting the component's evolution (12:21 PM).  The component name change between `Create` and `SocialPage` is a minor detail within these changes.  This indicates that the `social` page now serves as a container for the campaign creation form.


## 2:15:02 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `Create.jsx` on June 18th, 2025, between 1:15 PM and 2:14 PM.  The core functionality remains consistent: a form for creating a campaign with fields for title, start date, end date, budget, brand name, brand goals, and a description.  The changes primarily focus on the layout and styling of the form using Tailwind CSS.

Initially, the campaign title, start date, and end date were in separate input fields arranged in a two-column grid. Later revisions modified this to a two-column grid  with the title on the left and start/end dates on the right.  A subsequent revision briefly explored a three-column grid for these fields before reverting to the two-column layout.  There were also several iterations removing and adding placeholder text inputs for Start and End Dates, ultimately settling on using `type="date"` input fields.  The "Discover Influencers" button's styling was also adjusted multiple times, changing background color and finally settling on `bg-[#989898]`.  The final change at 2:14 PM involved commenting out the entire component.  This suggests that the component may have been temporarily disabled or replaced during the development process.  The  `<> </>`  fragment changed to `<div> </div>` also suggests changes related to the main container.


## 3:20:15 PM
The log shows significant changes to two main files: `Create.jsx` and `Discover.jsx`.  `Create.jsx` underwent several revisions between 2:20 PM and 2:25 PM, primarily involving restructuring the layout of a campaign creation form.  Initially, the code was heavily commented out, suggesting a work in progress. The final version of `Create.jsx` at 2:25 PM includes a fully functional form with input fields for campaign title, start and end dates (using `react-datepicker`), budget, brand name, brand goals (select dropdown), and a description (textarea). A "Discover Influencers" button is also present, enabling form submission.  The button's styling changes depending on whether required fields are filled.

The `Discover.jsx` file was significantly modified after 2:45 PM, indicating the creation of a new component for influencer discovery.  Earlier versions contained only placeholder text. By 3:19 PM, this component became a fully functional influencer search and display section.  It features a search bar, filters (category, sub-category, location, gender, language, verification status), and a table displaying influencer data (name, handle, location, gender, language, followers, category, sub-category, category size, weekly posts, overall engagement, effective followers, reels views).  The styling of the `Discover` component evolved considerably.  There's a noticeable shift from using `lucide-react` icons to using `react-icons/fi` and `react-icons/fa`,  along with other stylistic refinements to the layout, spacing and color scheme.

The files `social\page.jsx` (under the `src\app` directory) were updated at 2:38 PM and 2:40 PM, and again at 2:45 PM, reflecting changes to which component (`Create` or `Discover`) is rendered within the "Social" page. This suggests navigation between a campaign creation page and an influencer discovery page.  These changes happened around the same time as major revisions in `Create.jsx` and `Discover.jsx`.
