# Activity Summary for 6/16/2025

## 9:44:20 AM
The log shows updates to two React component files, `ImageSearch.jsx` and `Gallery.jsx`, on June 16, 2025.

`ImageSearch.jsx` (9:38:18 AM): This component handles image uploading, searching, and display.  Key features include:

* **Image Upload and Validation:**  Allows users to upload images, validating file type and size.  Uploaded images are displayed and their data URL is stored in state.
* **Image Search:** Sends uploaded images to a backend API (`API_BASE_URL`) for similarity search.  Results are displayed with similarity scores (color-coded), and pagination is implemented.  The API response is transformed to match the component's data structure.
* **Image Display:** Images are displayed in a grid or list view, sortable by similarity or name, and filterable by minimum similarity score.
* **Error and Success Handling:** Uses state variables to manage error and success messages, automatically clearing them after a set time.
* **State Management:** Uses multiple `useState` hooks to manage various aspects of the component, including uploaded image, search results, loading status, error messages, view mode, sorting options, pagination, and more.


`Gallery.jsx` (9:38:33 AM): This component displays a gallery of images associated with orders.  It's more complex than `ImageSearch.jsx`, incorporating:

* **Data Fetching:** Fetches order data and associated files (images, CAD files, text files) from a backend API using authenticated requests.  The API endpoints are configured using environment variables.  The code handles multiple image uploads per order, creating unique IDs for each file.
* **Image Search Integration:** Includes functionality to initiate an image search using the `IMAGE_SEARCH_API` (which appears to be the same API used in `ImageSearch.jsx`).
* **Filtering and Sorting:** Allows filtering by order status and sorting by creation date, order ID, or customer name.
* **Pagination:** Implements pagination to handle large numbers of gallery items.
* **Download and View Functionality:**  Provides buttons to download and view images.
* **Modal for Order Details:**  A modal displays detailed information about a selected order.
* **Error Handling:** Includes error handling and an automatic timeout for clearing error messages.
* **Image Carousel:** A reusable carousel component is included for displaying multiple reference images for each order.

Both components use similar error handling and loading state management.  Both also utilize a backend API for image related operations, suggesting a consistent backend architecture.  The use of environment variables for API URLs promotes configuration flexibility.  Both components are extensively commented which greatly improves readability and understanding.
