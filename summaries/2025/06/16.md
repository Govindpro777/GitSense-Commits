# Activity Summary for 6/16/2025

## 9:44:20 AM
The log shows updates to two React component files, `ImageSearch.jsx` and `Gallery.jsx`, on June 16, 2025.

`ImageSearch.jsx` (9:38:18 AM): This component handles image uploading, searching, and display.  Key features include:

* **Image Upload and Validation:**  Allows users to upload images, validating file type and size.  Uploaded images are displayed and their data URL is stored in state.
* **Image Search:** Sends uploaded images to a backend API (`API_BASE_URL`) for similarity search.  Results are displayed with similarity scores (color-coded), and pagination is implemented.  The API response is transformed to match the component's data structure.
* **Image Display:** Images are displayed in a grid or list view, sortable by similarity or name, and filterable by minimum similarity score.
* **Error and Success Handling:** Uses state variables to manage error and success messages, automatically clearing them after a set time.
* **State Management:** Uses multiple `useState` hooks to manage various aspects of the component, including uploaded image, search results, loading status, error messages, view mode, sorting options, pagination, and more.


`Gallery.jsx` (9:38:33 AM): This component displays a gallery of images associated with orders.  It's more complex than `ImageSearch.jsx`, incorporating:

* **Data Fetching:** Fetches order data and associated files (images, CAD files, text files) from a backend API using authenticated requests.  The API endpoints are configured using environment variables.  The code handles multiple image uploads per order, creating unique IDs for each file.
* **Image Search Integration:** Includes functionality to initiate an image search using the `IMAGE_SEARCH_API` (which appears to be the same API used in `ImageSearch.jsx`).
* **Filtering and Sorting:** Allows filtering by order status and sorting by creation date, order ID, or customer name.
* **Pagination:** Implements pagination to handle large numbers of gallery items.
* **Download and View Functionality:**  Provides buttons to download and view images.
* **Modal for Order Details:**  A modal displays detailed information about a selected order.
* **Error Handling:** Includes error handling and an automatic timeout for clearing error messages.
* **Image Carousel:** A reusable carousel component is included for displaying multiple reference images for each order.

Both components use similar error handling and loading state management.  Both also utilize a backend API for image related operations, suggesting a consistent backend architecture.  The use of environment variables for API URLs promotes configuration flexibility.  Both components are extensively commented which greatly improves readability and understanding.


## 10:44:18 AM
The log shows two main code changes on June 16th, 2025,  relating to the display of brand narratives.

The first change, at 10:02:44 AM, in `Narratives.tsx`,  completely overhauled the component.  The original code contained commented-out imports and a basic structure for displaying a logo, title ("Narrative"),  and placeholder components for a timeline chart and narratives section. The updated component (`CombinedNarratives`) now uses `react-apexcharts` to render a line chart visualizing narrative mentions over time, and displays narrative data fetched from a hard-coded `narrativeData` array. This array contains detailed information about each narrative, including sentiment, mentions, title, author, sources, publication details, description, and links.  The chart data and the narrative data are closely related, both focusing on the same narrative about Groww receiving CCI approval.

The second change, at 10:03:07 AM, in `Narratives2.tsx`, creates a reusable `NarrativesSection` component. This component renders the narrative information from the `narrativeData` array,  displaying each narrative's sentiment, count, title, author, sources, publication, category, sub-category (if available), location (if available), description, and links in a visually structured format. The  `narrativeData` array in `Narratives2.tsx` contains two entries, both detailing the same Groww-related news, but with slightly different dates and some additional details in the second entry.  The component's design is consistent with that used for narratives in `Narratives.tsx`.  A commented-out section in `Narratives2.tsx` shows additional narrative data related to Google, suggesting this component might be designed to handle multiple brand narratives in the future.


Both updated components (`CombinedNarratives` and `NarrativesSection`) heavily utilize styled components with inline styles, aiming for a specific visual presentation, likely intended for a PDF report.  The changes reflect a shift from a placeholder structure to a fully functional component for showcasing brand narrative data with visual aids.  The use of the same narrative data (about Groww) across both files suggests a close relationship between the components and the data they display.
