# Activity Summary for 6/7/2025

## 1:06:54 AM
The file `DemoCards.js` underwent a significant update on 6/7/2025, 12:45:56 AM.  The changes primarily involve enhancing course filtering and display functionalities.  The component now includes filtering options for course mode ('All', 'Online', 'Offline') and branch (for offline courses only).  A new state variable, `branchFilter`, was added to manage branch selection.  The filtering logic was significantly improved to handle various search terms (subject, description, category, teacher name) and ensures that only active courses are displayed. The UI was updated to include filter buttons for both desktop and mobile views, using a combination of `MapPin` icons and text to represent branches.  The code also includes improved date formatting, image handling, and teacher name aggregation functions, resulting in a more robust and user-friendly course display.  There is also improved handling of edge cases, like missing teacher information or invalid dates.  The pagination is implemented using `itemsPerPage` and `currentPage` state variables. Finally, a function `handleBookClick` is added to handle course booking using session storage and route navigation.  The code extensively uses conditional rendering and styling to manage the display based on filter selections and data availability.
