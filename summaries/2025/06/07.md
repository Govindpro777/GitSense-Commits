# Activity Summary for 6/7/2025

## 1:06:54 AM
The file `DemoCards.js` underwent a significant update on 6/7/2025, 12:45:56 AM.  The changes primarily involve enhancing course filtering and display functionalities.  The component now includes filtering options for course mode ('All', 'Online', 'Offline') and branch (for offline courses only).  A new state variable, `branchFilter`, was added to manage branch selection.  The filtering logic was significantly improved to handle various search terms (subject, description, category, teacher name) and ensures that only active courses are displayed. The UI was updated to include filter buttons for both desktop and mobile views, using a combination of `MapPin` icons and text to represent branches.  The code also includes improved date formatting, image handling, and teacher name aggregation functions, resulting in a more robust and user-friendly course display.  There is also improved handling of edge cases, like missing teacher information or invalid dates.  The pagination is implemented using `itemsPerPage` and `currentPage` state variables. Finally, a function `handleBookClick` is added to handle course booking using session storage and route navigation.  The code extensively uses conditional rendering and styling to manage the display based on filter selections and data availability.


## 9:44:00 AM
The log shows code changes across several files in a Learning Management System (LMS) frontend and dashboard.

**`DemoCards.js` (6/7/2025, 7:41:42 AM and 6/7/2025, 7:41:48 AM):**  These entries show no effective code changes, only minor differences in commented-out code.  The file displays a list of courses with filtering options for mode (Online/Offline) and branch (for offline courses only).  The code includes client-side search functionality, pagination (6 items per page), and a modal for viewing course details.  Significant features include functions for formatting dates, getting image URLs, highlighting search terms, and retrieving teacher names.  The branch filtering is reset when the mode filter changes.

**`page.js` (6/7/2025, 7:44:20 AM and 6/7/2025, 7:45:41 AM):** Again, no effective changes between the two timestamps. This file implements student registration.  It uses a state management system (`useStudentStore`) and handles form validation, OTP sending and verification. Upon successful verification, the user is logged in and redirected to `https://lms-dashboards.netlify.app`. The form includes input fields for name, date of birth, email, mobile number, password, and confirmation password, all with client-side validation.  Error messages are dynamically displayed using Tailwind CSS styling.

**`AuthContext.js` (6/7/2025, 8:00:46 AM and 6/7/2025, 8:02:33 AM):**  The second entry corrects the missing `value` prop in the `AuthContext.Provider`.  This component provides authentication context, managing login and logout states, user data, and tokens. It uses `sessionStorage` to persist login information.  The 8:00:46 AM version was missing the crucial `value` prop,  preventing the context from being properly passed down the component tree. The corrected version (8:02:33 AM) adds `roleBasedData` to the context and fixes the missing `value` prop, allowing the rest of the application to use the context properly.

**`courseDetails.jsx` (6/7/2025, 8:04:32 AM):** This file displays detailed information for a specific course.  It receives the course data via React Router's `useLocation` hook. If a course is not found, it displays an error message with a back button. The component showcases course details like subject, description, instructors, schedule, enrollment status, and a progress bar indicating enrollment progress.  It also uses functions to format teacher names, dates, and image URLs.  The `highlightSearchTerm` function highlights search terms within the displayed text, enhancing the user experience.


## 10:43:58 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to several files within a React-based frontend application for a Learning Management System (LMS).

`studentStore.jsx`: This file, a Zustand store managing student data, underwent two revisions on June 7th, 2025, between 9:55 AM and 9:56 AM.  The key change was in the `loginStudent` function's API endpoint, shifting from `/auth/v1/login` to `/auth/login`. The store uses cookies for persistence and handles student registration, OTP verification, and logout.  The `sendOtp` and `verifyStudentOtp` functions both make API calls and update store state based on responses including success or error messages.


`page.js`:  This component, likely a demo page, was updated on June 7th, 2025, at 10:26:58 AM.  It fetches courses using a custom hook (`useDemoCourseStore`). The code implements error handling and automatic refresh when no courses are available or an error occurs. It displays loading placeholders while fetching courses.

`Navigation.js`: This component, responsible for navigation and user authentication, was updated on June 7th, 2025, at 10:27:23 AM.  The revision added a logo (`/Dunamis.png`), updated links (including an "About Us" page), and modified the authentication section to include separate login and registration buttons.  It uses a custom authentication hook (`useAuth`) to determine user status and display appropriate UI elements.

`DemoCards.js`: This component, responsible for displaying demo courses, underwent multiple revisions between 10:34 AM and 10:42 AM on June 7th, 2025. These revisions appear to be incremental changes and primarily focused on filtering and displaying courses.  It incorporates filtering by course mode ('Online', 'Offline') and branch. The component handles pagination, displaying 6 items per page, and includes commented-out code suggesting previous iterations or functionality that may have been removed or replaced.  The many small revisions to this file suggest iterative improvements or bug fixes related to the course display and filtering mechanisms.


## 12:15:53 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple components in a React application, primarily focusing on UI elements and a custom poll node for a lexical editor.

**`Hero.js` (6/7/2025, 11:29:45 AM):** This component renders a hero section with a conditional navbar (based on authentication state), a top banner image, and a search bar.  The navbar dynamically switches between a `CommunityNavbar`, `MobileNavBar`, and `LandingNavbar` depending on whether the user is authenticated.  The hero section text adapts based on a `subjectShow` prop.

**`dialog.jsx` (Multiple timestamps):** This file defines a reusable dialog component using the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` library.  Multiple revisions occurred between 11:45 AM and 12:06 PM.  The main change was the addition of the `DialogContent` component, which adds functionality for a close button and improved styling and animation for the dialog's appearance and disappearance.  The component provides elements for header, footer, title, and description, allowing for flexible dialog creation.

**`PollNode.js` (6/7/2025, 12:03:38 PM):** This file introduces a custom Lexical editor node for creating and displaying polls. The code includes functionality for adding, removing, and voting on poll options, along with client-side vote counting and persistence through JSON export/import. The UI uses radio buttons instead of checkboxes for option selection.

**`RequestPaymentPopup.jsx` (6/7/2025, 12:08:18 PM):** This component displays a popup for requesting payment for a missed lesson.  It features a loading overlay, error handling, and buttons for contacting the student and requesting payment, leveraging Redux for state management.  The component uses `@mantine/core` for styling components such as buttons and LoadingOverlay.

**`LessonReschedule.jsx` (Two timestamps, 12:09:25 PM and 12:10:22 PM):**  This component displays a popup confirming a lesson reschedule.  It shows the new date and time, along with the tutor's name, fetched from Redux. A minor change between the two timestamps is removing the title from the GlobalPopup.

**`ChooseYourPackage.jsx` (6/7/2025, 12:11:06 PM):** This component displays a popup allowing users to choose a package from a tutor's offerings. It fetches tutor details and package pricing, uses a `PackageSelector` component, and includes error handling.  It also uses a `SubjectSelectorPopup` which appears to handle subject selection.

**`OpinionCountsPopup.js` (6/7/2025, 12:11:55 PM):** This component displays a popup survey asking users to rate their experience. It uses a star rating system and displays a Sitejabber logo.

In summary, the code changes reflect development work on several user interface components, with a focus on creating reusable components, integrating with external libraries, and managing application state effectively using Redux.  The pattern of using `GlobalPopup` as a base for various modals is consistently seen.  The use of a variety of styling libraries and techniques also indicates a conscious effort towards a well-styled user interface.


## 1:55:57 PM
The log shows several code modifications across three files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project between 12:56 PM and 1:40 PM on June 7th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the tutor listing functionality, particularly the sitemap generation and tutor information display.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutors\[SubjectName]\city\[city-name]\page.jsx`**: This file, updated at 12:56 PM,  handles the tutor list page for a specific subject and city.  The `generateMetadata` function fetches subject name and keywords from an API (`/tutor/search/categories/all`, `/tutor/search/subject/description/{subjectSlug}`) and constructs metadata for SEO purposes. The `TutorListPage` component renders a `TutorList` component and structured data for search engines.  The code uses environment variables (which are omitted from the summary because they might contain sensitive information) for API endpoints and user authentication.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\sitemaps\tutors\tutorSitemap.js`**: This file underwent significant changes. Initially (1:05 PM), it contained a `generateTutorSitemapXML` function to generate a sitemap for tutors, fetching tutor data from the API `/tutor/search/by-subject`. The function includes retry logic (`fetchWithRetry`) for API calls.  Subsequent commits (1:09 PM, 1:09 PM, 1:14 PM, 1:14 PM, 1:15 PM) show an evolution in functionality.  The function was initially commented out and then rewritten to incorporate city-specific sitemaps.  The final version (1:15 PM) iterates through a list of predefined cities, fetching and generating sitemap entries for tutors in each city. It uses a `fetchWithRetry` function to handle potential API request failures and introduces error handling and improved logging.  The `batchSize` was reduced from 25 to 10 "for better reliability".  The User-Agent header has been improved to clearly identify it as SitemapBot.  A timeout of 10 seconds has been introduced to the API calls.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\tutorListPage\tutor.jsx`**: This component, updated at 1:16 PM, 1:24 PM, 1:24 PM, and 1:40 PM, displays the tutor list. Several changes were made to enhance its functionality and reliability. The most significant change was adding the ability to fetch and display tutor information considering the city from `localStorage`.  This is done by adding `headers: { city: localStorage.getItem("city"), }` to the axiosInstance.get call in `fetchDefaultData`. The use of Lodash's `_.debounce` for fetching data is notable for performance optimization.  There was also logging added to `useSelector` hook at 1:24PM.  Error handling and retry mechanisms were implemented to improve the user experience. The component uses Redux to manage the application state and utilizes cookies for user authentication and identification. The initial `fetchDefaultData` calls were corrected to work better with the `generateTutorSitemapXML` changes.


The overall pattern across changes shows a focus on improving the robustness and SEO of the tutor listing functionality by adding city-specific functionality to the sitemap generation, robust error handling, and improved data fetching. There's also a notable shift from solely using subject-based filtering to a more comprehensive approach that includes city-based filtering.


## 2:55:49 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the `reviews` directory within a React application.  The most significant modifications occur between 2:06 PM and 2:09 PM on June 7th, 2025.

`Rating.js`: This file contains a React component for displaying and interacting with tutor reviews. It features a detailed implementation including star ratings, pagination, and data fetching using `axiosInstance`.  The component handles rendering of comments, including tutor replies, and displays user avatars.  Time formatting functions are also included to show how recent reviews are.


`ReviewList.js`: This component acts as a container, bringing together various other components (`Hero`, `Rating`, `ReasonsToChoose`, `FAQHomework`, `Footer`, `TutorRelatedSubjects`) to display a complete review page.  A crucial update adds a state variable `totalReviews` and passes it to the `Hero` component and receives it from the `Rating` component. This allows for displaying the total number of reviews dynamically in the Hero section.  This update happened around 2:07 PM.


`Hero.js`:  This file shows the hero section of the review page.  The major change was to update the text displayed below the main header, to dynamically show the total number of reviews received from `ReviewList.js` and showing a loading message until the count is available. Multiple updates (2:07 PM, 2:08 PM, 2:09 PM) refined the loading message and updated the platform name from "AmazingTalker" to "Expert Buddy".  The component also conditionally renders a navbar based on authentication state.
