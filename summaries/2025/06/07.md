# Activity Summary for 6/7/2025

## 1:06:54 AM
The file `DemoCards.js` underwent a significant update on 6/7/2025, 12:45:56 AM.  The changes primarily involve enhancing course filtering and display functionalities.  The component now includes filtering options for course mode ('All', 'Online', 'Offline') and branch (for offline courses only).  A new state variable, `branchFilter`, was added to manage branch selection.  The filtering logic was significantly improved to handle various search terms (subject, description, category, teacher name) and ensures that only active courses are displayed. The UI was updated to include filter buttons for both desktop and mobile views, using a combination of `MapPin` icons and text to represent branches.  The code also includes improved date formatting, image handling, and teacher name aggregation functions, resulting in a more robust and user-friendly course display.  There is also improved handling of edge cases, like missing teacher information or invalid dates.  The pagination is implemented using `itemsPerPage` and `currentPage` state variables. Finally, a function `handleBookClick` is added to handle course booking using session storage and route navigation.  The code extensively uses conditional rendering and styling to manage the display based on filter selections and data availability.


## 9:44:00 AM
The log shows code changes across several files in a Learning Management System (LMS) frontend and dashboard.

**`DemoCards.js` (6/7/2025, 7:41:42 AM and 6/7/2025, 7:41:48 AM):**  These entries show no effective code changes, only minor differences in commented-out code.  The file displays a list of courses with filtering options for mode (Online/Offline) and branch (for offline courses only).  The code includes client-side search functionality, pagination (6 items per page), and a modal for viewing course details.  Significant features include functions for formatting dates, getting image URLs, highlighting search terms, and retrieving teacher names.  The branch filtering is reset when the mode filter changes.

**`page.js` (6/7/2025, 7:44:20 AM and 6/7/2025, 7:45:41 AM):** Again, no effective changes between the two timestamps. This file implements student registration.  It uses a state management system (`useStudentStore`) and handles form validation, OTP sending and verification. Upon successful verification, the user is logged in and redirected to `https://lms-dashboards.netlify.app`. The form includes input fields for name, date of birth, email, mobile number, password, and confirmation password, all with client-side validation.  Error messages are dynamically displayed using Tailwind CSS styling.

**`AuthContext.js` (6/7/2025, 8:00:46 AM and 6/7/2025, 8:02:33 AM):**  The second entry corrects the missing `value` prop in the `AuthContext.Provider`.  This component provides authentication context, managing login and logout states, user data, and tokens. It uses `sessionStorage` to persist login information.  The 8:00:46 AM version was missing the crucial `value` prop,  preventing the context from being properly passed down the component tree. The corrected version (8:02:33 AM) adds `roleBasedData` to the context and fixes the missing `value` prop, allowing the rest of the application to use the context properly.

**`courseDetails.jsx` (6/7/2025, 8:04:32 AM):** This file displays detailed information for a specific course.  It receives the course data via React Router's `useLocation` hook. If a course is not found, it displays an error message with a back button. The component showcases course details like subject, description, instructors, schedule, enrollment status, and a progress bar indicating enrollment progress.  It also uses functions to format teacher names, dates, and image URLs.  The `highlightSearchTerm` function highlights search terms within the displayed text, enhancing the user experience.
