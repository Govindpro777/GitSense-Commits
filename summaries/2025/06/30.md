# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 10:27:12 AM
The log shows modifications to two files related to payment processing in a Learning Management System (LMS).

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_frontend\src\app\payment\payement.js` underwent several revisions between 9:48 AM and 10:18 AM on June 30, 2025.  The primary changes involved the implementation of payment functionality using Razorpay. Initially, the file contained commented-out code, suggesting work-in-progress.  Subsequent commits progressively uncommented and completed the code, adding functionality for fetching course and teacher details from an API (`/course/getCourseById/:courseId` and `/teacher/getTeacherById/:teacherId`),  integrating a Razorpay checkout, and handling payment success.  The code extensively uses `debugLog` for API call logging, indicating a development or debugging phase.  The final version includes a `useEffect` hook to load the Razorpay script and  functions to handle API calls and the payment process itself.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\courses\Payments.jsx` was modified between 10:20 AM and 10:26 AM on June 30, 2025.  This file contains React components for a payment modal and a booking confirmation popup.  Changes include adding a confirmation popup (`ConfirmationPopup`) to display booking details after a successful payment.  The `PaymentModal` component was updated to handle the payment process via Razorpay, including an API call to create a payment order and verify it after successful payment. The component uses  `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` to construct API URLs, suggesting environment variable usage for backend URLs.  The payment process involves calls to `/payment/create-order` and `/payment/verify-and-book` endpoints.  The code also includes error handling and loading indicators.

In summary, the changes reflect the development and refinement of the payment system in the LMS, encompassing frontend integration with Razorpay (including error handling and loading states) and backend API interaction for order creation and verification.  The frequent commits to `payement.js` suggest an iterative development process focused on the payment flow. The `Payments.jsx` changes are primarily focused on enhancing user experience with visual feedback after payment processing.


## 11:07:46 AM
The `next.config.mjs` file was updated on June 30th, 2025 at 10:49:10 AM.  The changes configure Next.js to allow image imports from three different `goskribe.com` domains (`beta.goskribe.com`, `www.beta.goskribe.com`, and `www.goskribe.com`).  The configuration also includes commented-out options for `reactStrictMode` and `distDir`, suggesting potential past experimentation or debugging efforts.


## 1:07:50 PM
The `EmailPreview.jsx` component underwent several revisions on June 30th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was refining the handling and display of email content, particularly regarding deliverables and campaign brief information.

The first significant change (12:36:04 PM) involved fetching draft data using `userService.get()` based on a `campId`.  This data is then used to populate the email preview, dynamically inserting brand name and campaign title into the introduction.  A `generateDeliverableTable` function was introduced to format deliverables data into a table.  The component allows editing of the email content and updates internal state accordingly, splitting the content into sections (greeting, introduction, etc.) based on predefined markers.

A minor update at 12:38:07 PM  simplified the `generateDeliverableTable` function by removing the unnecessary `item.addressText` from the description column.

Subsequent changes at 12:43:03 PM and 12:43:30 PM focused on further refining the `generateDeliverableTable` function.  The 12:43:03 PM revision removed the default 'Standard Rights' fallback for `item.brandRights`. The 12:43:30 PM update corrected a typo, replacing `item.conte` with `item.conte**nt**Text` in the deliverables table description.

Finally, at 12:43:40 PM, a stylistic adjustment was made to the "Edit" button, adding `font-semibold` to enhance its visual appearance.  Throughout the edits, the core functionality of fetching, displaying, and editing email previews remained consistent; the changes were primarily focused on data presentation and minor bug fixes.


## 2:07:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `Discover.jsx`.  Both files are React components.

**`EmailPreview.jsx` (6/30/2025, 1:14:12 PM):** This component renders a preview of an email, allowing users to edit the content.  It fetches draft data using `userService.get`, specifically targeting a campaign ID (`campId`).  The email content is dynamically generated based on fetched data (e.g., brand name, campaign title) and includes a table for deliverables. Attachments are displayed and can be removed.  A significant update at this timestamp involved building the functionality for fetching and displaying draft data within the email preview, enabling dynamic content population. The component also handles editing the email content, allowing users to modify various sections like greeting, introduction, and call to action.


**`Discover.jsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component is significantly more complex, acting as a social media influencer discovery tool. It features filtering options (categories, locations, languages, gender, follower count) and advanced filtering (engagement rate, effective followers, reel views).  Data is fetched from `userService.post` using the `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA` endpoint. The fetched data (`instagramCreators`) is then displayed.  The component uses URL parameters to manage the filter state and updates the URL whenever filter values change. There is also functionality to shortlist selected influencers and store them locally using localStorage, to be carried over to another page (`/social/shortlist`). The numerous timestamps between 1:18:50 PM and 2:07:36 PM indicate incremental changes, primarily focused on refining the functionality and potentially fixing bugs related to data fetching and URL parameter handling. One recurring modification appears to be the repeated adjustment to the `advanceFilterOptions` array, suggesting refinement or correction to the advanced filtering options within the component.  The final change at 2:07:36 PM  likely represents a finalized, stable version of the component.


## 3:08:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Discover.jsx` between 2:08 PM and 2:41 PM on June 30, 2025.  The component is a React component that fetches and displays Instagram creator data based on various filter criteria.  The primary changes revolve around adding and refining filtering capabilities.

Initially, the code includes filters for categories, locations, languages, gender, and follower counts.  There's also a `handleSearch` function that sends a request to `/GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA` based on the current filter values.  The response is handled to update the `instagramCreators` state.  Shortlisting functionality uses local storage to maintain a list of shortlisted creators.  The component also fetches draft data via a `/GET_DRAFT_DATA` endpoint and uses it to pre-populate the selected influencers.  There's a noticeable, repeated addition of  `{ key: "avgBrandedViews", label: "Avg branded views" }` within the `advanceFilterOptions` array, indicating a potential error in code replication.


Between 2:08 PM and 2:13 PM, there are several minor revisions; most changes appear to be related to the handling of URL parameters, ensuring the component correctly reflects the initial state based on URL parameters and updates them when states change.  There is also the addition of error handling for the API calls.


Around 2:22 PM, a new state variable, `categorySize`, is added, suggesting the introduction of a category size filter. This is further refined around 2:28 PM with the addition of `categorySizeOptions` state and a new array defining the options for this filter.  The `categorySizeOptions` array contains options like "Celebrity," "mega+," "mega," etc.

The final significant change around 2:35 PM introduces an engagement rate filter (`engagementRateValue`, `isEngRateDropdownOpen`, and `engRateRef`), and a category filter dropdown (`isCategoryDropdownOpen`, `categoryRef`) to enhance the search.  The addition of `categorySizeOptions` array provides options for filtering by category size (e.g., "Celebrity", "mega+").  The repeated "Avg branded views" entries in `advanceFilterOptions` remain unresolved through these revisions.  The last update at 2:41 PM appears to be a minor cleanup related to the variable names and no further functional changes are added.


## 5:08:03 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Discover.jsx` on June 30th, 2025, between 3:19 PM and 5:01 PM.  The main focus of the changes appears to be refining the UI related to Instagram influencer discovery.

Initially, the component fetched Instagram data based on various filters (categories, locations, languages, gender, follower count, and advanced metrics like engagement rate).  The `getInstagramData` function plays a central role in this process, making API calls using `userService.post(GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA, payload)`. The results are then displayed, and a shortlist of influencers can be saved to local storage.

The revisions involved:

* **Multiple updates to `advanceFilterOptions`**: This array, defining advanced filter options, underwent several changes, adding, removing, and renaming entries.  Specifically, there were multiple additions and deletions of the `"avgBrandedViews"` key, and finally settling on including  `"weeklyPost"`, `"avgReelViews"`, `"avgLikes"`, `"engagementRate"`, and `"effectiveFollowers"`. This suggests ongoing refinement of the filtering capabilities.

* **Changes to `tableHeadings`**:  The array defining the table headers was significantly expanded in a single revision (around 4:27 PM) to include many more detailed Instagram metrics (e.g., "Following", "Average Likes (%)", "Average Comments (%)", "Average Shares (%)", etc.).  Before this change, the table showed more basic information.  This is a major structural change to the component's output.

* **Refactoring of `topHeadings`**: A `topHeadings` array was introduced and modified (around 4:57 PM - 5:01 PM),  changing its contents to better reflect the addition of multiple metrics in the table, using descriptive names like "Reels Metrics", "Story Metrics", and "Videos Post Metrics".

There were no changes in the core logic of the component; most of the changes seem superficial and aimed at improving user experience by providing more granular data and informative labels within the UI.  The use of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks indicates a functional component that manages its state and performs side effects effectively. The consistent use of `userService` for API interactions points to a well-structured data fetching mechanism.


## 6:07:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Discover.jsx` and one to `Shortlist.jsx` within a short time frame on June 30th, 2025.  The `Discover.jsx` component underwent extensive changes, primarily focused on refining the table headings and adding data columns.  Initially, the table included headings like "Reels Metrics," "Story Metrics," and "Videos Post Metrics," which were later expanded to include metrics such as "Avg. Likes," "Avg. Comments," and "Avg Views."  These changes occurred between 5:11 PM and 5:27 PM.  The component uses `userService` for API calls to fetch data (`GET_CATEGORY_OPTIONS`, `GET_CITY_OPTIONS`, `GET_LANGUAGE_OPTIONS`, `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA`, `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`, `GET_DRAFT_DATA`), manages filtering options (categories, locations, languages, gender, followers), and uses local storage to manage shortlisted creators. The `Shortlist.jsx` file was completely commented out at 5:40 PM and then restored with some modifications around 5:53 PM introducing `columnGroups` to improve table structure.  The modifications of `Shortlist.jsx` seem unrelated to the changes in `Discover.jsx` besides the use of similar API calls and local storage mechanisms.


## 7:07:59 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ShortList.jsx` on June 30th, 2025, between 6:16 PM and 7:02 PM.  The file is a React component that displays a shortlist of creators, likely for a social media campaign.  The code uses Next.js navigation hooks (`useRouter`, `usePathname`, `useSearchParams`) and interacts with a backend service (`userService`) via several API endpoints: `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA`, `GET_DRAFT_DATA`, `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`, `ADD_ENGAGED_CREATOR`, and `REMOVE_ENGAGED_CREATOR`.

The component manages state for search terms, filters (verified, contact info), selected creators, modal display, loading state, and data retrieval.  It fetches data based on a `campaignId` prop, utilizing `localStorage` to store shortlisted creator IDs.  The numerous `useEffect` hooks manage data fetching, URL parameter synchronization, and modal control.  Filtering logic is implemented to search creators by name or handle, filter by verification status, and prioritize creators with contact information.  Creator selection updates the state and URL parameters, persisting changes.  The `updateDraftData` function updates a draft on the server, presumably to save the shortlist or outreach status.


The timestamps indicate frequent changes, possibly reflecting iterative development and debugging.  The core functionality and structure of the component remain consistent across all revisions; the changes appear primarily to be minor adjustments and likely bug fixes rather than major feature additions or redesigns.  No significant patterns in the code content changes are evident beyond the iterative refinement of the existing structure and functionality.


## 9:55:05 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of two React component files: `ImageSearch.jsx` and `UploadedFilesModal.jsx`.  No changes were made to the functionality or structure of either component across the multiple revisions at different times.

`ImageSearch.jsx` underwent several revisions between 8:55 PM and 8:57 PM on June 30, 2025, but the code remained identical in each revision. The component handles image uploads, database additions, searches, and display.  It fetches data from an API (`API_BASE_URL`, likely configured via environment variables).  Image uploads are validated for type and size.  Search results are transformed before being displayed. Error and success messages are displayed with auto-clearing functionality.


`UploadedFilesModal.jsx` shows changes between 9:01 PM and 9:17 PM on June 30, 2025.  Again, the code within each revision is identical, despite multiple entries in the log. This component displays uploaded files (images, CAD files, text files) associated with a given order. It fetches file data using a POST request to an API endpoint, requiring authentication (`localStorage.getItem("token")`). The component includes functionality for deleting files with confirmation and error handling.  The UI uses tabs to switch between file types and displays download and delete options.
