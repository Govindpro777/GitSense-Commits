# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 10:27:12 AM
The log shows modifications to two files related to payment processing in a Learning Management System (LMS).

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_frontend\src\app\payment\payement.js` underwent several revisions between 9:48 AM and 10:18 AM on June 30, 2025.  The primary changes involved the implementation of payment functionality using Razorpay. Initially, the file contained commented-out code, suggesting work-in-progress.  Subsequent commits progressively uncommented and completed the code, adding functionality for fetching course and teacher details from an API (`/course/getCourseById/:courseId` and `/teacher/getTeacherById/:teacherId`),  integrating a Razorpay checkout, and handling payment success.  The code extensively uses `debugLog` for API call logging, indicating a development or debugging phase.  The final version includes a `useEffect` hook to load the Razorpay script and  functions to handle API calls and the payment process itself.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\courses\Payments.jsx` was modified between 10:20 AM and 10:26 AM on June 30, 2025.  This file contains React components for a payment modal and a booking confirmation popup.  Changes include adding a confirmation popup (`ConfirmationPopup`) to display booking details after a successful payment.  The `PaymentModal` component was updated to handle the payment process via Razorpay, including an API call to create a payment order and verify it after successful payment. The component uses  `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` to construct API URLs, suggesting environment variable usage for backend URLs.  The payment process involves calls to `/payment/create-order` and `/payment/verify-and-book` endpoints.  The code also includes error handling and loading indicators.

In summary, the changes reflect the development and refinement of the payment system in the LMS, encompassing frontend integration with Razorpay (including error handling and loading states) and backend API interaction for order creation and verification.  The frequent commits to `payement.js` suggest an iterative development process focused on the payment flow. The `Payments.jsx` changes are primarily focused on enhancing user experience with visual feedback after payment processing.


## 11:07:46 AM
The `next.config.mjs` file was updated on June 30th, 2025 at 10:49:10 AM.  The changes configure Next.js to allow image imports from three different `goskribe.com` domains (`beta.goskribe.com`, `www.beta.goskribe.com`, and `www.goskribe.com`).  The configuration also includes commented-out options for `reactStrictMode` and `distDir`, suggesting potential past experimentation or debugging efforts.


## 1:07:50 PM
The `EmailPreview.jsx` component underwent several revisions on June 30th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was refining the handling and display of email content, particularly regarding deliverables and campaign brief information.

The first significant change (12:36:04 PM) involved fetching draft data using `userService.get()` based on a `campId`.  This data is then used to populate the email preview, dynamically inserting brand name and campaign title into the introduction.  A `generateDeliverableTable` function was introduced to format deliverables data into a table.  The component allows editing of the email content and updates internal state accordingly, splitting the content into sections (greeting, introduction, etc.) based on predefined markers.

A minor update at 12:38:07 PM  simplified the `generateDeliverableTable` function by removing the unnecessary `item.addressText` from the description column.

Subsequent changes at 12:43:03 PM and 12:43:30 PM focused on further refining the `generateDeliverableTable` function.  The 12:43:03 PM revision removed the default 'Standard Rights' fallback for `item.brandRights`. The 12:43:30 PM update corrected a typo, replacing `item.conte` with `item.conte**nt**Text` in the deliverables table description.

Finally, at 12:43:40 PM, a stylistic adjustment was made to the "Edit" button, adding `font-semibold` to enhance its visual appearance.  Throughout the edits, the core functionality of fetching, displaying, and editing email previews remained consistent; the changes were primarily focused on data presentation and minor bug fixes.


## 2:07:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `Discover.jsx`.  Both files are React components.

**`EmailPreview.jsx` (6/30/2025, 1:14:12 PM):** This component renders a preview of an email, allowing users to edit the content.  It fetches draft data using `userService.get`, specifically targeting a campaign ID (`campId`).  The email content is dynamically generated based on fetched data (e.g., brand name, campaign title) and includes a table for deliverables. Attachments are displayed and can be removed.  A significant update at this timestamp involved building the functionality for fetching and displaying draft data within the email preview, enabling dynamic content population. The component also handles editing the email content, allowing users to modify various sections like greeting, introduction, and call to action.


**`Discover.jsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component is significantly more complex, acting as a social media influencer discovery tool. It features filtering options (categories, locations, languages, gender, follower count) and advanced filtering (engagement rate, effective followers, reel views).  Data is fetched from `userService.post` using the `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA` endpoint. The fetched data (`instagramCreators`) is then displayed.  The component uses URL parameters to manage the filter state and updates the URL whenever filter values change. There is also functionality to shortlist selected influencers and store them locally using localStorage, to be carried over to another page (`/social/shortlist`). The numerous timestamps between 1:18:50 PM and 2:07:36 PM indicate incremental changes, primarily focused on refining the functionality and potentially fixing bugs related to data fetching and URL parameter handling. One recurring modification appears to be the repeated adjustment to the `advanceFilterOptions` array, suggesting refinement or correction to the advanced filtering options within the component.  The final change at 2:07:36 PM  likely represents a finalized, stable version of the component.


## 3:08:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Discover.jsx` between 2:08 PM and 2:41 PM on June 30, 2025.  The component is a React component that fetches and displays Instagram creator data based on various filter criteria.  The primary changes revolve around adding and refining filtering capabilities.

Initially, the code includes filters for categories, locations, languages, gender, and follower counts.  There's also a `handleSearch` function that sends a request to `/GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA` based on the current filter values.  The response is handled to update the `instagramCreators` state.  Shortlisting functionality uses local storage to maintain a list of shortlisted creators.  The component also fetches draft data via a `/GET_DRAFT_DATA` endpoint and uses it to pre-populate the selected influencers.  There's a noticeable, repeated addition of  `{ key: "avgBrandedViews", label: "Avg branded views" }` within the `advanceFilterOptions` array, indicating a potential error in code replication.


Between 2:08 PM and 2:13 PM, there are several minor revisions; most changes appear to be related to the handling of URL parameters, ensuring the component correctly reflects the initial state based on URL parameters and updates them when states change.  There is also the addition of error handling for the API calls.


Around 2:22 PM, a new state variable, `categorySize`, is added, suggesting the introduction of a category size filter. This is further refined around 2:28 PM with the addition of `categorySizeOptions` state and a new array defining the options for this filter.  The `categorySizeOptions` array contains options like "Celebrity," "mega+," "mega," etc.

The final significant change around 2:35 PM introduces an engagement rate filter (`engagementRateValue`, `isEngRateDropdownOpen`, and `engRateRef`), and a category filter dropdown (`isCategoryDropdownOpen`, `categoryRef`) to enhance the search.  The addition of `categorySizeOptions` array provides options for filtering by category size (e.g., "Celebrity", "mega+").  The repeated "Avg branded views" entries in `advanceFilterOptions` remain unresolved through these revisions.  The last update at 2:41 PM appears to be a minor cleanup related to the variable names and no further functional changes are added.
