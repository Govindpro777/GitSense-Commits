# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

The log shows modifications to two files related to payment processing in a Learning Management System (LMS).

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_frontend\src\app\payment\payement.js` underwent several revisions between 9:48 AM and 10:18 AM on June 30, 2025.  The primary changes involved the implementation of payment functionality using Razorpay. Initially, the file contained commented-out code, suggesting work-in-progress.  Subsequent commits progressively uncommented and completed the code, adding functionality for fetching course and teacher details from an API (`/course/getCourseById/:courseId` and `/teacher/getTeacherById/:teacherId`),  integrating a Razorpay checkout, and handling payment success.  The code extensively uses `debugLog` for API call logging, indicating a development or debugging phase.  The final version includes a `useEffect` hook to load the Razorpay script and  functions to handle API calls and the payment process itself.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\courses\Payments.jsx` was modified between 10:20 AM and 10:26 AM on June 30, 2025.  This file contains React components for a payment modal and a booking confirmation popup.  Changes include adding a confirmation popup (`ConfirmationPopup`) to display booking details after a successful payment.  The `PaymentModal` component was updated to handle the payment process via Razorpay, including an API call to create a payment order and verify it after successful payment. The component uses  `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` to construct API URLs, suggesting environment variable usage for backend URLs.  The payment process involves calls to `/payment/create-order` and `/payment/verify-and-book` endpoints.  The code also includes error handling and loading indicators.

In summary, the changes reflect the development and refinement of the payment system in the LMS, encompassing frontend integration with Razorpay (including error handling and loading states) and backend API interaction for order creation and verification.  The frequent commits to `payement.js` suggest an iterative development process focused on the payment flow. The `Payments.jsx` changes are primarily focused on enhancing user experience with visual feedback after payment processing.
