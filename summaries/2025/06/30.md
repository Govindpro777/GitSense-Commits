# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 10:27:12 AM
The log shows modifications to two files related to payment processing in a Learning Management System (LMS).

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_frontend\src\app\payment\payement.js` underwent several revisions between 9:48 AM and 10:18 AM on June 30, 2025.  The primary changes involved the implementation of payment functionality using Razorpay. Initially, the file contained commented-out code, suggesting work-in-progress.  Subsequent commits progressively uncommented and completed the code, adding functionality for fetching course and teacher details from an API (`/course/getCourseById/:courseId` and `/teacher/getTeacherById/:teacherId`),  integrating a Razorpay checkout, and handling payment success.  The code extensively uses `debugLog` for API call logging, indicating a development or debugging phase.  The final version includes a `useEffect` hook to load the Razorpay script and  functions to handle API calls and the payment process itself.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\LMS FINAL\LMS_dashboard\src\components\courses\Payments.jsx` was modified between 10:20 AM and 10:26 AM on June 30, 2025.  This file contains React components for a payment modal and a booking confirmation popup.  Changes include adding a confirmation popup (`ConfirmationPopup`) to display booking details after a successful payment.  The `PaymentModal` component was updated to handle the payment process via Razorpay, including an API call to create a payment order and verify it after successful payment. The component uses  `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` to construct API URLs, suggesting environment variable usage for backend URLs.  The payment process involves calls to `/payment/create-order` and `/payment/verify-and-book` endpoints.  The code also includes error handling and loading indicators.

In summary, the changes reflect the development and refinement of the payment system in the LMS, encompassing frontend integration with Razorpay (including error handling and loading states) and backend API interaction for order creation and verification.  The frequent commits to `payement.js` suggest an iterative development process focused on the payment flow. The `Payments.jsx` changes are primarily focused on enhancing user experience with visual feedback after payment processing.


## 11:07:46 AM
The `next.config.mjs` file was updated on June 30th, 2025 at 10:49:10 AM.  The changes configure Next.js to allow image imports from three different `goskribe.com` domains (`beta.goskribe.com`, `www.beta.goskribe.com`, and `www.goskribe.com`).  The configuration also includes commented-out options for `reactStrictMode` and `distDir`, suggesting potential past experimentation or debugging efforts.


## 1:07:50 PM
The `EmailPreview.jsx` component underwent several revisions on June 30th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was refining the handling and display of email content, particularly regarding deliverables and campaign brief information.

The first significant change (12:36:04 PM) involved fetching draft data using `userService.get()` based on a `campId`.  This data is then used to populate the email preview, dynamically inserting brand name and campaign title into the introduction.  A `generateDeliverableTable` function was introduced to format deliverables data into a table.  The component allows editing of the email content and updates internal state accordingly, splitting the content into sections (greeting, introduction, etc.) based on predefined markers.

A minor update at 12:38:07 PM  simplified the `generateDeliverableTable` function by removing the unnecessary `item.addressText` from the description column.

Subsequent changes at 12:43:03 PM and 12:43:30 PM focused on further refining the `generateDeliverableTable` function.  The 12:43:03 PM revision removed the default 'Standard Rights' fallback for `item.brandRights`. The 12:43:30 PM update corrected a typo, replacing `item.conte` with `item.conte**nt**Text` in the deliverables table description.

Finally, at 12:43:40 PM, a stylistic adjustment was made to the "Edit" button, adding `font-semibold` to enhance its visual appearance.  Throughout the edits, the core functionality of fetching, displaying, and editing email previews remained consistent; the changes were primarily focused on data presentation and minor bug fixes.
