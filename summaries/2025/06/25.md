# Activity Summary for 6/25/2025

## 10:30:21 AM
The log shows a React component (`CampaignOutreach.jsx`) undergoing significant modifications between 9:47 AM and 10:28 AM on June 25, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: managing campaign outreach, including deliverables, campaign briefs, and email previews.  However, several key features are added or altered.


Initially, the component included functionality for adding and deleting deliverables, uploading attachments (with validation for file type and size), and displaying image previews.  There was a "Preview Email" button enabling a modal for email preview, and a "Send Mail" button.

Between 9:47 AM and 9:49 AM, the most substantial changes were made. A scheduling feature was introduced, initially with separate date and time inputs.  These were later combined into a single `datetime-local` input by 10:21 AM.  The styling of the schedule button and related elements also changed during this period.  The "Schedule" button was initially commented out and later made visible in the UI.  This suggests an iterative development process focused on refining the scheduling functionality.

From 9:53 AM onwards, the `EmailSent.jsx` component was introduced and modified. This component displays a success message after the email has been sent. Initially, it contained a checkmark icon represented by SVG code.  This was later replaced with a checkmark image (`/assets/check-green.svg`) at around 10:09 AM, also experiencing changes in image size in subsequent commits.



Throughout the entire process, the `CampaignOutreach.jsx` component's core structure remained largely the same.  The modifications primarily focused on the addition of email scheduling and the styling of the UI, along with several minor style adjustments to buttons and inputs.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes is evident throughout the code. The file size and type validation for attachments remained unchanged.


## 11:30:28 AM
The log shows a single file, `CampaignOutreach.jsx`, undergoing multiple revisions on June 25th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be the implementation and refinement of a scheduling feature.

Initially, a commented-out scheduling button and a datetime-local input were present.  Subsequent revisions progressively made changes:


* **10:38:14 AM:** The hidden datetime-local input (`type="datetime-local"`) becomes visible, indicating the first step towards an active scheduling feature.


* **10:40:26 AM:** The datetime-local input is further refined, incorporating placeholding text ("Schedule") that disappears once a date is selected.


* **10:46:17 AM - 10:48:17 AM:**  A `useRef` hook (`inputRef`) and a `handleScheduleClick` function are introduced. This suggests a move towards programmatically controlling the datetime-local input, likely to improve the user interface.  The commented-out schedule button remains.


* **10:47:45 AM - 10:55:20 AM:** The commented-out schedule button and related state variables are removed, confirming a shift to a more streamlined approach with a single "Schedule" button triggering the calendar input.


* **10:58:11 AM - 11:01:05 AM:** The `handleScheduleClick` function is improved to handle potential null values more robustly.  It now attempts a more modern browser-friendly approach (`showPicker`) as a primary method and then uses the fallback method (`click`).


* **11:01:21 AM - 11:03:40 AM:** Minor adjustments are made to the styling and placement of the date/time picker. The `style` attribute is used to make the input element invisible, rather than relying solely on the `className` property. The margin-bottom is adjusted multiple times.


* **11:23:11 AM - 11:29:44 AM:** The structure of the schedule button and input elements is consistently changed. It attempts to create a better presentation by moving the hidden input and button into a div.


* **11:26:06 AM - 11:29:44 AM:** Further refinements to the scheduling section's layout and presentation using flexbox and gap properties are made, to improve the visual presentation.  The commented-out code related to the previous scheduling approach is removed during this period.

Throughout the process, the core functionality of the `CampaignOutreach` component—handling content type, duration, quantity, deliverables, campaign brief, image uploads, and email preview—remains unchanged. The consistent modifications focus exclusively on enhancing the user experience and implementing a more effective scheduling mechanism.


## 12:30:22 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `CampaignOutreach.jsx` component and the `constants.js` file between 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM on June 25th, 2025.

The `CampaignOutreach.jsx` file underwent multiple revisions focusing primarily on the UI and functionality related to scheduling and sending emails, handling file uploads, and displaying attachment previews.  Initial changes involved adding a datetime-local input field and a "Schedule" button for scheduling email delivery.  Subsequent revisions added a "Send Mail" button, modifying its appearance based on whether an email was sent (`isMailSent` state). The  `handleScheduleClick` function suggests the use of a date/time picker.  There were several minor UI adjustments in the styling of buttons and input fields across multiple commits. The final commit shows the component completely commented out.


The `constants.js` file was modified to define various API endpoints.  These endpoints cover a wide range of functionalities, including authentication (`LOGINAPI`, `REFRESHTOKEN_API`, etc.), user information (`USERINFO`), reporting (`REPORTSAPI`), settings (`USERPREFERENCES`), campaign management (`CREATELIST`, `GETCAMPAIGNLIST`, `CAMPAIGN_SEND_MAIL`), CRM interactions (`CRMAPI`, `PRECRM_POSTDATA`), and other features like podcast details (`PODCASTHOME`, `PODCASTDETAIL`).  The changes  in this file seem unrelated to the UI adjustments in `CampaignOutreach.jsx` and possibly represent a separate development task.  The  `contentTypeOptions` array was changed to include objects with `id` and `value` properties instead of just strings.  No other significant pattern changes were made to this file.


## 1:30:16 PM
The log shows several revisions to the `CampaignOutreach.jsx` component and the `Dropdown.jsx` component between 12:31 PM and 1:21 PM on June 25, 2025.

`CampaignOutreach.jsx` underwent significant changes.  Early versions (12:31 PM and 12:33 PM) were commented-out, indicating a substantial rewrite.  The final version (1:11 PM) introduces a key feature:  fetching duration options dynamically based on selected content type using `userService.get` and the `GET_CATEGORY_BY_TYPES` constant. This involves an API call to populate a dropdown with durations specific to the content type.  Error handling and loading states are implemented (`isLoadingDuration`).  The `contentTypeOptions` array is restructured to include `id` and `value` properties for better data handling.  The component also includes functionality for adding, deleting, and previewing deliverables, managing attachments (with size and type validation), and sending/scheduling emails.


The `Dropdown.jsx` component received minor updates between 1:21 PM and 1:21 PM.  These changes primarily focused on improving the styling and functionality of the dropdown. The most notable change was adjusting the `max-h` style of the dropdown's content to improve the display of long lists of options from `max-h-22` to `max-h-48` allowing for better scrollability in the dropdown menu.  The addition of `overflow-y-auto` ensures smooth scrolling within the dropdown when there are more items than can be displayed.


In summary, the most substantial changes involve the dynamic loading of duration options in `CampaignOutreach.jsx` based on API calls reflecting a move towards more data-driven UI behavior. The changes to `Dropdown.jsx` were primarily visual enhancements to its display.  The overall pattern in both files is a refinement and enhancement of the UI components, primarily driven by the introduction of API-driven data in `CampaignOutreach.jsx`.


## 2:30:14 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `src\constants.js` between 1:36 PM and 1:37 PM on June 25th, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor and do not change the overall content of the file. The file contains a large number of constants, primarily API endpoints for various functionalities, including authentication, user preferences, reporting, campaigns, CRM interactions, and social media integrations (Instagram and Twitter).  There is also a `STATICCOUNT` constant set to 1000, likely used for pagination or data limiting.  The API endpoints consistently use  `Url_V1`, `url`, and `ATTACH_URL` which are dynamically generated using environment variables.


A React component, `CampaignOutreach.jsx`, underwent significant changes.  The first revision at 1:37:52 PM introduced a component for managing campaign outreach, including features for selecting content type, duration, quantity, adding deliverables, uploading attachments (JPG, PNG, PDF, with a 5MB limit), and previewing emails.  The component uses `ReactQuill` for rich text editing of campaign briefs and interacts with a backend service (`userService`) via API calls (`GET_CATEGORY_BY_TYPES`).

A subsequent revision at 1:38:40 PM added  `SAVE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS` to the imports from `@/constants`. The final revision at 2:14:32 PM completely removed all code from the `CampaignOutreach.jsx` file.  The last revision at 2:18:27 PM restored the code to a state very similar to the revision at 1:38:40 PM, implying a possible accidental deletion and recovery.


## 3:30:17 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` throughout the afternoon of June 25th, 2025, with no changes detected in the `Shortlist.jsx` file after its initial commit.  All updates to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` appear to be commented-out code; no actual code changes were made to this file. The commented code suggests a React component for campaign outreach, featuring functionalities like:

* **Dropdown selections:**  for content type ("Reels," "Story," "Post"), duration (fetched dynamically based on content type), and quantity.
* **Deliverable management:** adding and deleting deliverables with associated requirements and brand rights.
* **File uploads:** with validation for file type (JPG, PNG, PDF) and size (5MB).  There is handling for displaying and removing uploaded files.
* **Error handling:** using a `useNotification` hook to display messages to the user.
* **Data fetching:**  using `userService.get` to fetch duration options from an API endpoint (`GET_CATEGORY_BY_TYPES`).

The `Shortlist.jsx` file, updated once at 2:33:44 PM, is a React component displaying a table of creators. This component includes:

* **Search functionality:** filtering creators by name or handle.
* **Filtering:** based on verification status and other attributes.
* **Creator selection:** allowing users to select creators for a campaign.
* **Modal:** opening a `CampaignOutreach` modal upon clicking "Engage" button.  This necessitates the existence of a `CampaignOutreach` component.
* **Tooltip:**  providing additional information for certain columns.

A pattern in the `CampaignOutreach.jsx` logs is the repeated appearance of the same commented-out code across multiple timestamps.  This suggests either the developer is experimenting with different approaches or is working through a version control process, possibly with frequent rollbacks to earlier versions.


## 4:30:15 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CampaignOutreach.jsx`  between 3:46 PM and 4:22 PM on June 25, 2025.  The core functionality of the component remains consistent throughout these revisions; it's a React component for managing campaign outreach, including selecting content type, duration, and quantity, adding deliverables, and providing a section for campaign brief and file uploads.

The changes primarily involve UI enhancements and refinements to the file upload functionality.  Early revisions show the component's basic structure, with placeholders for imports and functional elements.

The most significant change occurs in the final revision (4:22 PM) where a ReactQuill component is added for the campaign brief, along with a more robust file upload section, including  preview images and clear indicators for file type and size limits, error handling and a "Preview Email" button whose enabled state depends on a valid campaign brief.  The earlier revisions lack this improved file handling and rich text editing capability.  The code consistently uses a functional component structure with useState and useEffect hooks.  There is also consistent use of  external libraries for UI components (`DropdownComponent`, `ReactQuill`) and icons (`react-icons`). The frequent updates suggest iterative development and bug fixing or UI improvements.


## 5:30:21 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` on June 25th, 2025.  The majority of the changes appear to be related to the UI component's structure and functionality, not to the core logic.  There's no substantial alteration to the component's overall purpose.  Changes are incremental, with minor adjustments and additions to the code between 4:32 PM and 5:29 PM.


Specifically, the component is a React component responsible for displaying and managing campaign outreach details.  It includes elements such as dropdowns for content type and quantity, a table for deliverables, a rich text editor for campaign briefs (`ReactQuill`), and file upload functionality.

The timestamps show frequent edits, suggesting iterative development and debugging.  The code consistently uses React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for managing state and side effects, common in React development. The use of a third-party library (`react-quill-new`) is also evident.  The file upload section rigorously validates file types and sizes, and supports JPG, JPEG, PNG, and PDF files with a 5MB size limit.  A noticeable addition is the `campaignId` prop towards the end of the log, suggesting the component's integration with specific campaign data.  The commented-out code in several entries implies a trial and error approach during development.  The final version shows a mostly complete UI component with file upload, campaign brief input, and preview functionality.


## 6:30:18 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx`, a React component, between 5:31 PM and 6:22 PM on June 25, 2025.  The component appears to handle campaign outreach features, likely for social media. No changes were made to the code functionality during this time; all changes were very minor, likely related to formatting or very minor adjustments. There is a single update to `user.service.js` at 5:53:38 PM, which appears to be a service for handling API calls, including get, post, put and delete requests with authorization headers.  The `CampaignOutreach.jsx` file contains a lot of commented-out code which might indicate work in progress or elements that were later removed.  The many updates to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` with no change in functionality suggests debugging or iterative design choices rather than substantial feature additions.
