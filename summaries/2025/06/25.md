# Activity Summary for 6/25/2025

## 10:30:21 AM
The log shows a React component (`CampaignOutreach.jsx`) undergoing significant modifications between 9:47 AM and 10:28 AM on June 25, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: managing campaign outreach, including deliverables, campaign briefs, and email previews.  However, several key features are added or altered.


Initially, the component included functionality for adding and deleting deliverables, uploading attachments (with validation for file type and size), and displaying image previews.  There was a "Preview Email" button enabling a modal for email preview, and a "Send Mail" button.

Between 9:47 AM and 9:49 AM, the most substantial changes were made. A scheduling feature was introduced, initially with separate date and time inputs.  These were later combined into a single `datetime-local` input by 10:21 AM.  The styling of the schedule button and related elements also changed during this period.  The "Schedule" button was initially commented out and later made visible in the UI.  This suggests an iterative development process focused on refining the scheduling functionality.

From 9:53 AM onwards, the `EmailSent.jsx` component was introduced and modified. This component displays a success message after the email has been sent. Initially, it contained a checkmark icon represented by SVG code.  This was later replaced with a checkmark image (`/assets/check-green.svg`) at around 10:09 AM, also experiencing changes in image size in subsequent commits.



Throughout the entire process, the `CampaignOutreach.jsx` component's core structure remained largely the same.  The modifications primarily focused on the addition of email scheduling and the styling of the UI, along with several minor style adjustments to buttons and inputs.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes is evident throughout the code. The file size and type validation for attachments remained unchanged.
