# Activity Summary for 6/25/2025

## 10:30:21 AM
The log shows a React component (`CampaignOutreach.jsx`) undergoing significant modifications between 9:47 AM and 10:28 AM on June 25, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: managing campaign outreach, including deliverables, campaign briefs, and email previews.  However, several key features are added or altered.


Initially, the component included functionality for adding and deleting deliverables, uploading attachments (with validation for file type and size), and displaying image previews.  There was a "Preview Email" button enabling a modal for email preview, and a "Send Mail" button.

Between 9:47 AM and 9:49 AM, the most substantial changes were made. A scheduling feature was introduced, initially with separate date and time inputs.  These were later combined into a single `datetime-local` input by 10:21 AM.  The styling of the schedule button and related elements also changed during this period.  The "Schedule" button was initially commented out and later made visible in the UI.  This suggests an iterative development process focused on refining the scheduling functionality.

From 9:53 AM onwards, the `EmailSent.jsx` component was introduced and modified. This component displays a success message after the email has been sent. Initially, it contained a checkmark icon represented by SVG code.  This was later replaced with a checkmark image (`/assets/check-green.svg`) at around 10:09 AM, also experiencing changes in image size in subsequent commits.



Throughout the entire process, the `CampaignOutreach.jsx` component's core structure remained largely the same.  The modifications primarily focused on the addition of email scheduling and the styling of the UI, along with several minor style adjustments to buttons and inputs.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes is evident throughout the code. The file size and type validation for attachments remained unchanged.


## 11:30:28 AM
The log shows a single file, `CampaignOutreach.jsx`, undergoing multiple revisions on June 25th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be the implementation and refinement of a scheduling feature.

Initially, a commented-out scheduling button and a datetime-local input were present.  Subsequent revisions progressively made changes:


* **10:38:14 AM:** The hidden datetime-local input (`type="datetime-local"`) becomes visible, indicating the first step towards an active scheduling feature.


* **10:40:26 AM:** The datetime-local input is further refined, incorporating placeholding text ("Schedule") that disappears once a date is selected.


* **10:46:17 AM - 10:48:17 AM:**  A `useRef` hook (`inputRef`) and a `handleScheduleClick` function are introduced. This suggests a move towards programmatically controlling the datetime-local input, likely to improve the user interface.  The commented-out schedule button remains.


* **10:47:45 AM - 10:55:20 AM:** The commented-out schedule button and related state variables are removed, confirming a shift to a more streamlined approach with a single "Schedule" button triggering the calendar input.


* **10:58:11 AM - 11:01:05 AM:** The `handleScheduleClick` function is improved to handle potential null values more robustly.  It now attempts a more modern browser-friendly approach (`showPicker`) as a primary method and then uses the fallback method (`click`).


* **11:01:21 AM - 11:03:40 AM:** Minor adjustments are made to the styling and placement of the date/time picker. The `style` attribute is used to make the input element invisible, rather than relying solely on the `className` property. The margin-bottom is adjusted multiple times.


* **11:23:11 AM - 11:29:44 AM:** The structure of the schedule button and input elements is consistently changed. It attempts to create a better presentation by moving the hidden input and button into a div.


* **11:26:06 AM - 11:29:44 AM:** Further refinements to the scheduling section's layout and presentation using flexbox and gap properties are made, to improve the visual presentation.  The commented-out code related to the previous scheduling approach is removed during this period.

Throughout the process, the core functionality of the `CampaignOutreach` component—handling content type, duration, quantity, deliverables, campaign brief, image uploads, and email preview—remains unchanged. The consistent modifications focus exclusively on enhancing the user experience and implementing a more effective scheduling mechanism.


## 12:30:22 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `CampaignOutreach.jsx` component and the `constants.js` file between 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM on June 25th, 2025.

The `CampaignOutreach.jsx` file underwent multiple revisions focusing primarily on the UI and functionality related to scheduling and sending emails, handling file uploads, and displaying attachment previews.  Initial changes involved adding a datetime-local input field and a "Schedule" button for scheduling email delivery.  Subsequent revisions added a "Send Mail" button, modifying its appearance based on whether an email was sent (`isMailSent` state). The  `handleScheduleClick` function suggests the use of a date/time picker.  There were several minor UI adjustments in the styling of buttons and input fields across multiple commits. The final commit shows the component completely commented out.


The `constants.js` file was modified to define various API endpoints.  These endpoints cover a wide range of functionalities, including authentication (`LOGINAPI`, `REFRESHTOKEN_API`, etc.), user information (`USERINFO`), reporting (`REPORTSAPI`), settings (`USERPREFERENCES`), campaign management (`CREATELIST`, `GETCAMPAIGNLIST`, `CAMPAIGN_SEND_MAIL`), CRM interactions (`CRMAPI`, `PRECRM_POSTDATA`), and other features like podcast details (`PODCASTHOME`, `PODCASTDETAIL`).  The changes  in this file seem unrelated to the UI adjustments in `CampaignOutreach.jsx` and possibly represent a separate development task.  The  `contentTypeOptions` array was changed to include objects with `id` and `value` properties instead of just strings.  No other significant pattern changes were made to this file.
