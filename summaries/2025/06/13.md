# Activity Summary for 6/13/2025

## 7:38:37 AM
The `BrandSummary.tsx` component, updated on June 13th, 2025 at 12:18:38 AM, displays brand summary data using ReactApexCharts.  The component renders four charts: Top Publications (bar chart), Top Journalists (a custom visualization of the top 8 journalists based on provided data), Quality of Mentions (donut chart), and Regional Split (donut chart).  A sentiment score is also displayed using a radial bar chart.

The component fetches data (potentially from an API); if data fetching fails, it falls back to dummy data.  The code uses functional components, `useEffect` hooks for data handling, and `useState` hooks to manage chart data.  Each chart's configuration (series, options, colors, etc.) is meticulously defined, offering a high degree of customization.  The styling uses inline styles and class names for layout and appearance.  Significant changes include the updated implementation of the sentiment chart which now utilizes `sparkline` for better display in the provided space.  The consistent use of dummy data suggests a robust error-handling mechanism in place. The Top Journalists section dynamically renders a variable number of elements based on available data, and their size and position are also dynamically determined.


## 10:03:38 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `BrandSummary.tsx` between 9:03 AM and 10:03 AM on June 13th, 2025.  These edits appear to involve the implementation or refinement of a component that displays brand summary data using charts.  The code consistently uses dummy data (defined within `dummyData`) as a fallback when API data (`data` prop) is unavailable.  The dummy data includes information on publications, journalists, quality of mentions, regional splits, and sentiment scores.

The chart types used include bar charts, donut charts, and radial bar charts.  The code suggests the use of the `react-apexcharts` library for chart rendering.  There are many small edits to the `BrandSummary.tsx` component over this time frame, possibly reflecting iterative development and debugging.  No significant structural changes are evident from the provided snippets; the modifications seem focused on styling and minor adjustments to chart configurations.

Between 9:45 AM and 9:46 AM, two new files, `NarrativeModal.tsx` and `Narratives2.tsx`, were added. `NarrativeModal.tsx` renders individual narrative entries (likely from API data) with details such as type, count, title, author, sources, publication, category, sub-category, location, date, description, and links.  `Narratives2.tsx` is a very similar component, mainly differing in styling and the inclusion of a logo.  `Narratives.tsx` was also created, which appears to combine `TimelineChart` and `NarrativesSection` components.  These additions indicate the implementation of a section displaying narratives in the monthly report. The header in `Narratives2.tsx` had its color changed from `#01438D` to `#000000`  between 9:45 AM and 9:46 AM.
