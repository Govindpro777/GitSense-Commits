# Activity Summary for 6/13/2025

## 7:38:37 AM
The `BrandSummary.tsx` component, updated on June 13th, 2025 at 12:18:38 AM, displays brand summary data using ReactApexCharts.  The component renders four charts: Top Publications (bar chart), Top Journalists (a custom visualization of the top 8 journalists based on provided data), Quality of Mentions (donut chart), and Regional Split (donut chart).  A sentiment score is also displayed using a radial bar chart.

The component fetches data (potentially from an API); if data fetching fails, it falls back to dummy data.  The code uses functional components, `useEffect` hooks for data handling, and `useState` hooks to manage chart data.  Each chart's configuration (series, options, colors, etc.) is meticulously defined, offering a high degree of customization.  The styling uses inline styles and class names for layout and appearance.  Significant changes include the updated implementation of the sentiment chart which now utilizes `sparkline` for better display in the provided space.  The consistent use of dummy data suggests a robust error-handling mechanism in place. The Top Journalists section dynamically renders a variable number of elements based on available data, and their size and position are also dynamically determined.
