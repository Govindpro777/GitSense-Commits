# Activity Summary for 6/13/2025

## 7:38:37 AM
The `BrandSummary.tsx` component, updated on June 13th, 2025 at 12:18:38 AM, displays brand summary data using ReactApexCharts.  The component renders four charts: Top Publications (bar chart), Top Journalists (a custom visualization of the top 8 journalists based on provided data), Quality of Mentions (donut chart), and Regional Split (donut chart).  A sentiment score is also displayed using a radial bar chart.

The component fetches data (potentially from an API); if data fetching fails, it falls back to dummy data.  The code uses functional components, `useEffect` hooks for data handling, and `useState` hooks to manage chart data.  Each chart's configuration (series, options, colors, etc.) is meticulously defined, offering a high degree of customization.  The styling uses inline styles and class names for layout and appearance.  Significant changes include the updated implementation of the sentiment chart which now utilizes `sparkline` for better display in the provided space.  The consistent use of dummy data suggests a robust error-handling mechanism in place. The Top Journalists section dynamically renders a variable number of elements based on available data, and their size and position are also dynamically determined.


## 10:03:38 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `BrandSummary.tsx` between 9:03 AM and 10:03 AM on June 13th, 2025.  These edits appear to involve the implementation or refinement of a component that displays brand summary data using charts.  The code consistently uses dummy data (defined within `dummyData`) as a fallback when API data (`data` prop) is unavailable.  The dummy data includes information on publications, journalists, quality of mentions, regional splits, and sentiment scores.

The chart types used include bar charts, donut charts, and radial bar charts.  The code suggests the use of the `react-apexcharts` library for chart rendering.  There are many small edits to the `BrandSummary.tsx` component over this time frame, possibly reflecting iterative development and debugging.  No significant structural changes are evident from the provided snippets; the modifications seem focused on styling and minor adjustments to chart configurations.

Between 9:45 AM and 9:46 AM, two new files, `NarrativeModal.tsx` and `Narratives2.tsx`, were added. `NarrativeModal.tsx` renders individual narrative entries (likely from API data) with details such as type, count, title, author, sources, publication, category, sub-category, location, date, description, and links.  `Narratives2.tsx` is a very similar component, mainly differing in styling and the inclusion of a logo.  `Narratives.tsx` was also created, which appears to combine `TimelineChart` and `NarrativesSection` components.  These additions indicate the implementation of a section displaying narratives in the monthly report. The header in `Narratives2.tsx` had its color changed from `#01438D` to `#000000`  between 9:45 AM and 9:46 AM.


## 11:03:39 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `BrandSummary.tsx` and `TimeLine.tsx`, both related to a brand monthly report.  The changes span a period from 10:03:50 AM to 11:03:09 AM on June 13th, 2025.

**`BrandSummary.tsx`:** This file contains React code for displaying a brand summary, using `react-apexcharts` for creating charts.  The code repeatedly shows  commented-out code sections. This suggests iterative development and experimentation with different chart implementations for Publications, Quality of Mentions, Regional Split, and Sentiment Score.  The significant changes in this file seem to be around refactoring or commenting out  the Sentiment Score chart code between 10:43 AM and 11:03 AM.  The dummy data remains consistent across all revisions, suggesting the focus was on the chart presentation rather than data manipulation.

**`TimeLine.tsx`:**  This file displays a timeline chart using `react-apexcharts`.  The main changes between 10:14 AM and 10:33 AM focus on adjustments to the chart's height (`height` property reduced from 400 to 200), font sizes within the chart's labels and title, and the layout of the container div.  The `show: false`  modification to the toolbar suggests an effort to create a cleaner, more compact chart display. Between 10:33 AM and 10:34 AM, there was a commented out section showing an attempt to use `recharts` library instead of `react-apexcharts`.  After 10:33 AM,  the code reverts back to using `react-apexcharts`. There were some minor changes in the containing div's styling (padding and max-width) throughout the updates. The series data (narrative timelines) remain unchanged across all revisions of `TimeLine.tsx`.


## 12:03:31 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `BrandSummary.tsx` file between 11:05 AM and 11:27 AM on June 13, 2025.  The file contains React code that renders four charts: Top Publications (bar chart), Quality of Mentions (donut chart), Regional Split (donut chart), and Sentiment Score (radial bar chart).  All revisions maintain the same basic structure and chart types; the changes seem focused on refinements within the chart configurations rather than major structural alterations.  Each chart uses data from a `dummyData` object as a fallback if API data (`data` prop) is unavailable. This `dummyData` object consistently provides sample data for publications, journalists, quality metrics, regional data, and a sentiment score.  The numerous consecutive edits between 11:05 AM and 11:08 AM suggest iterative adjustments to the chart configurations (possibly styling or minor data handling), with the later changes at 11:13 AM and 11:25 AM indicating potentially more substantial modifications, although the exact nature of these changes cannot be determined without a diff. The code remains largely unchanged across all versions, emphasizing the iterative nature of these modifications.


## 12:37:59 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components related to a press release feature within a web application.  The changes primarily focus on managing user selections and data storage using `localStorage`.

`BrandStory.js` (11:56:40 AM): This component was updated to store user selections for distribution type ('transparent' or 'organic') in `localStorage` under a unified `pressRelease` key.  Previously, it used the `brandStorySelection` key. The new `pressRelease` object includes fields for `type`, `packagesData`, and `addOns`. This change suggests a move towards a more comprehensive data structure for managing press release information.

`DistributionPackages.js` (11:56:48 AM, 12:07:26 PM, 12:10:48 PM, 12:20:02 PM, 12:20:23 PM): This component, dealing with distribution package selection, remained largely unchanged throughout the log. It shows commented-out code which suggests earlier versions used `localStorage` to store selected packages under the `distributionPackages` key.  However, the commented out code was never reactivated. This implies that the functionality to save and load package selections was removed or temporarily disabled during the observed period.

`DistributionUpgrades.js` (11:58:52 AM, 12:00:37 PM, 12:03:33 PM, 12:11:34 PM, 12:12:40 PM):  This component, handling optional distribution upgrades, underwent significant changes. Initially, it stored selected upgrades in `localStorage` using the `distributionUpgrades` key. Later revisions refactored this to store upgrade selections within the `pressRelease` object in `localStorage`, aligning it with the changes in `BrandStory.js`. The final version includes a confirmation popup after the quote request and removes all press release data (`pressRelease`) from `localStorage` after 5 seconds.  A key improvement is error handling during `localStorage` access, preventing potential crashes.

`NonDisclaimer.js` (12:13:25 PM, 12:13:34 PM, 12:14:04 PM): This component, responsible for the non-disclaimer distribution flow, was updated to remove the `pressRelease` data from `localStorage` after a quote request. Earlier versions had a bug where it attempted to remove data using an empty string (`localStorage.removeItem('')`).  This error was corrected in subsequent commits.


Recurring pattern: The most significant pattern is the refactoring of `localStorage` usage.  There is a clear shift toward consolidating all press release data within a single `pressRelease` object instead of using separate keys for different parts of the process.  This suggests an improvement in data organization and management within the application.  The consistent use of `setTimeout` to clear `localStorage` after 5 seconds indicates a design choice to immediately confirm the request, then to clean up the user's selection data to prepare for the next request.


## 1:37:56 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files on June 13th, 2025.

**`constants.js`**: This file underwent two revisions, both around 1:03 PM.  The changes appear to be minor and involve no significant alterations to the code's core functionality. Both revisions contain a large number of API endpoints, suggesting configuration for a web application interacting with a backend service (likely version 1, indicated by `Url_V1`).  The endpoints cover various features including authentication, user preferences, reporting, campaign management, CRM interactions, and various data retrieval methods. The commented-out local URL suggests a shift from local development to a beta environment.

**`NonDisclaimer.js`**: This React component file shows a series of revisions between 1:04 PM and 1:23 PM. The initial changes focused on minor adjustments to imports, likely refactoring import paths. The most significant change occurred between 1:07 PM and 1:14 PM, where the entire component's code was commented out.  This suggests a potential temporary removal or disabling of the component.  A final commit at 1:14 PM and 1:15 PM keeps the code commented out. Subsequently, the file remained unchanged until the end of the provided log.


**Recurring Patterns**:  The `constants.js` file consistently uses environment variables (`process.env`) for API URLs and other sensitive data, promoting better security practices. The `NonDisclaimer.js` file utilizes consistent styling and structure throughout its many revisions, demonstrating a well-organized approach to UI development.  There is a recurring pattern of localStorage manipulation related to removing data after a quote request.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes**:

* **1:03 PM:**  Initial revision of `constants.js`.
* **1:04 PM:** Second (minor) revision of `constants.js`.
* **1:14 PM:**  `NonDisclaimer.js` is completely commented out, potentially indicating a temporary removal.
* **1:35 PM:**  Initial revision of `DistributionUpgrades.js`.  This file is commented out in its entirety.





## 2:37:51 PM
The code changes primarily involve three React components related to press release distribution: `BrandStory.js`, `DistributionUpgrades.js`, and `DistributionPackages.js`.  The changes span a short period between 1:49 PM and 2:00 PM on June 13th, 2025.

`BrandStory.js` underwent a significant revision. The initial version used `localStorage.setItem('brandStorySelection', ...)` to store user choices. This was refactored to use `localStorage.setItem('pressRelease', ...)` with a more structured data format including `packagesData` and `addOns` arrays, suggesting a move towards a more comprehensive data model.  This change aims to unify data storage across the press release workflow.

`DistributionUpgrades.js` shows numerous commented-out code sections. The component manages optional website upgrades, storing selections in `localStorage` under the key `distributionUpgrades`.  A quote request functionality is present, clearing relevant local storage (`distributionPackages`, `distributionUpgrades`, `brandStorySelection`) and navigating to `/dashboard` after five seconds.  The commented-out code suggests potential features that were either removed or are under development.  The numerous `//` comments indicate a large amount of code was either removed or was originally intended to be incorporated but ultimately removed.

`DistributionPackages.js` is a component for selecting distribution packages. It utilizes `localStorage` under the key `distributionPackages` to persist user selections.  The component presents "top-tier" and "standard" packages, with differences in their descriptions and included services.  The UI elements are styled using Tailwind CSS.  Similar to `DistributionUpgrades.js`, the code's structure is primarily for the selection of packages.  The commented-out code is largely the implementation of these features.

In summary, the code updates reflect a restructuring of the press release workflow, unifying data storage and improving the data model.  The `DistributionUpgrades.js` and `DistributionPackages.js` components handle user selections for optional upgrades and main packages, respectively, while `BrandStory.js` guides the user through package selection. A pattern of using `localStorage` to maintain state between components and pages is evident.  The frequent commenting-out of large code blocks suggests iterative development and refactoring.


## 3:03:29 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `BrandSummary.tsx` between 2:49 PM and 2:58 PM on June 13, 2025.  The file appears to be a React component responsible for displaying a brand's monthly report summary using charts.  The code uses `react-apexcharts` to render bar, donut, and radial bar charts visualizing data such as top publications, quality of mentions, regional split, and sentiment score.

Each revision shows minimal changes, primarily focusing on the `setSentimentData` function within the `useEffect` hook.  The initial revisions contain commented-out code for the sentiment chart, potentially representing iterative development and debugging.  The commented code shows an attempt to use a radialBar chart with gradient fill before switching to a simpler configuration.  The final revisions still seem to be experimenting with different chart configurations and heights for the sentiment chart, as the height changes between 120 and 140.

The component uses dummy data (`dummyData`) for development purposes, containing sample data for publications, journalists, quality metrics, regional data, and sentiment score.  This dummy data structure is consistent across all revisions.  The chart configurations are largely consistent throughout all versions, showing that the core functionality remains unchanged, with only minor styling and chart type adjustments within the `setSentimentData` function.


## 3:37:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `DistributionPackages.js` and `DistributionUpgrades.js`.  Both files heavily utilize local storage to manage user selections.

`DistributionPackages.js` (multiple timestamps between 3:02:04 PM and 3:37:09 PM): This file defines a component for selecting press release distribution packages.  The code lists various packages categorized as "Top tier" and "Standard," each with an ID, title, description, and details.  The component uses `localStorage` to store and retrieve the user's selected packages.  No functional changes are apparent across the multiple revisions during this time period; only the timestamp changes.


`DistributionUpgrades.js` (multiple timestamps between 3:13:58 PM and 3:37:09 PM): This file defines a component allowing users to select optional distribution upgrades. It uses checkboxes to let users choose additional postings on websites like Hindustan Times, Live Mint, and NDTV.  User selections are saved in `localStorage` with a timestamp and `requestStatus` set to 'pending'.  Similar to `DistributionPackages.js`,  there are no code changes visible in the multiple revisions, only timestamp updates are observed.  After selection, a popup confirms the quote request, and after a 5-second delay, local storage is cleared and the user navigates to the `/dashboard` route.


## 5:03:29 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `BrandSummary.tsx` between 4:35 PM and 4:42 PM on June 13, 2025.  The file contains React code that renders charts using `react-apexcharts`.  These charts visualize data related to brand performance, including:

* **Top Publications:** A bar chart showing publication counts (e.g., TG, HT, NDTV).
* **Quality of Mentions:** A donut chart displaying counts for different mention types (e.g., Active, Passive, Headline), each with a specific color.
* **Regional Split:** Another donut chart representing counts across various regions (e.g., Top Publish, Online, TV), also with assigned colors.
* **Sentiment Score:** A radial bar chart illustrating a sentiment score.

The code includes dummy data for development purposes, which is used if the API call fails.  The multiple revisions appear to involve minor adjustments and may reflect iterative debugging or refinements to the chart display, but the core structure and functionality of the component remain consistent across all timestamps. The height of the Sentiment Score chart was changed from 120 to 140 in the final revision, and the `sparkline` property was added to the chart options.  There are no substantive changes in the data or chart types themselves across the revisions.


## 6:03:27 PM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\TimeLine.tsx` on June 13, 2025, at 5:12:46 PM.  The change modifies a React component that renders a timeline chart using `react-apexcharts`.  The primary alterations involve reducing the chart's height from 400 to 200 pixels and decreasing the font sizes within the chart's title, axis labels, and legend for a more compact layout. Additionally, the zoom toolbar was hidden (`show: false`).  The chart data (series) and basic structure remained unchanged.  The code is commented out in both versions of the log.
