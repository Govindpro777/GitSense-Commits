# Activity Summary for 6/13/2025

## 7:38:37 AM
The `BrandSummary.tsx` component, updated on June 13th, 2025 at 12:18:38 AM, displays brand summary data using ReactApexCharts.  The component renders four charts: Top Publications (bar chart), Top Journalists (a custom visualization of the top 8 journalists based on provided data), Quality of Mentions (donut chart), and Regional Split (donut chart).  A sentiment score is also displayed using a radial bar chart.

The component fetches data (potentially from an API); if data fetching fails, it falls back to dummy data.  The code uses functional components, `useEffect` hooks for data handling, and `useState` hooks to manage chart data.  Each chart's configuration (series, options, colors, etc.) is meticulously defined, offering a high degree of customization.  The styling uses inline styles and class names for layout and appearance.  Significant changes include the updated implementation of the sentiment chart which now utilizes `sparkline` for better display in the provided space.  The consistent use of dummy data suggests a robust error-handling mechanism in place. The Top Journalists section dynamically renders a variable number of elements based on available data, and their size and position are also dynamically determined.


## 10:03:38 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `BrandSummary.tsx` between 9:03 AM and 10:03 AM on June 13th, 2025.  These edits appear to involve the implementation or refinement of a component that displays brand summary data using charts.  The code consistently uses dummy data (defined within `dummyData`) as a fallback when API data (`data` prop) is unavailable.  The dummy data includes information on publications, journalists, quality of mentions, regional splits, and sentiment scores.

The chart types used include bar charts, donut charts, and radial bar charts.  The code suggests the use of the `react-apexcharts` library for chart rendering.  There are many small edits to the `BrandSummary.tsx` component over this time frame, possibly reflecting iterative development and debugging.  No significant structural changes are evident from the provided snippets; the modifications seem focused on styling and minor adjustments to chart configurations.

Between 9:45 AM and 9:46 AM, two new files, `NarrativeModal.tsx` and `Narratives2.tsx`, were added. `NarrativeModal.tsx` renders individual narrative entries (likely from API data) with details such as type, count, title, author, sources, publication, category, sub-category, location, date, description, and links.  `Narratives2.tsx` is a very similar component, mainly differing in styling and the inclusion of a logo.  `Narratives.tsx` was also created, which appears to combine `TimelineChart` and `NarrativesSection` components.  These additions indicate the implementation of a section displaying narratives in the monthly report. The header in `Narratives2.tsx` had its color changed from `#01438D` to `#000000`  between 9:45 AM and 9:46 AM.


## 11:03:39 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `BrandSummary.tsx` and `TimeLine.tsx`, both related to a brand monthly report.  The changes span a period from 10:03:50 AM to 11:03:09 AM on June 13th, 2025.

**`BrandSummary.tsx`:** This file contains React code for displaying a brand summary, using `react-apexcharts` for creating charts.  The code repeatedly shows  commented-out code sections. This suggests iterative development and experimentation with different chart implementations for Publications, Quality of Mentions, Regional Split, and Sentiment Score.  The significant changes in this file seem to be around refactoring or commenting out  the Sentiment Score chart code between 10:43 AM and 11:03 AM.  The dummy data remains consistent across all revisions, suggesting the focus was on the chart presentation rather than data manipulation.

**`TimeLine.tsx`:**  This file displays a timeline chart using `react-apexcharts`.  The main changes between 10:14 AM and 10:33 AM focus on adjustments to the chart's height (`height` property reduced from 400 to 200), font sizes within the chart's labels and title, and the layout of the container div.  The `show: false`  modification to the toolbar suggests an effort to create a cleaner, more compact chart display. Between 10:33 AM and 10:34 AM, there was a commented out section showing an attempt to use `recharts` library instead of `react-apexcharts`.  After 10:33 AM,  the code reverts back to using `react-apexcharts`. There were some minor changes in the containing div's styling (padding and max-width) throughout the updates. The series data (narrative timelines) remain unchanged across all revisions of `TimeLine.tsx`.


## 12:03:31 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `BrandSummary.tsx` file between 11:05 AM and 11:27 AM on June 13, 2025.  The file contains React code that renders four charts: Top Publications (bar chart), Quality of Mentions (donut chart), Regional Split (donut chart), and Sentiment Score (radial bar chart).  All revisions maintain the same basic structure and chart types; the changes seem focused on refinements within the chart configurations rather than major structural alterations.  Each chart uses data from a `dummyData` object as a fallback if API data (`data` prop) is unavailable. This `dummyData` object consistently provides sample data for publications, journalists, quality metrics, regional data, and a sentiment score.  The numerous consecutive edits between 11:05 AM and 11:08 AM suggest iterative adjustments to the chart configurations (possibly styling or minor data handling), with the later changes at 11:13 AM and 11:25 AM indicating potentially more substantial modifications, although the exact nature of these changes cannot be determined without a diff. The code remains largely unchanged across all versions, emphasizing the iterative nature of these modifications.


## 12:37:59 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components related to a press release feature within a web application.  The changes primarily focus on managing user selections and data storage using `localStorage`.

`BrandStory.js` (11:56:40 AM): This component was updated to store user selections for distribution type ('transparent' or 'organic') in `localStorage` under a unified `pressRelease` key.  Previously, it used the `brandStorySelection` key. The new `pressRelease` object includes fields for `type`, `packagesData`, and `addOns`. This change suggests a move towards a more comprehensive data structure for managing press release information.

`DistributionPackages.js` (11:56:48 AM, 12:07:26 PM, 12:10:48 PM, 12:20:02 PM, 12:20:23 PM): This component, dealing with distribution package selection, remained largely unchanged throughout the log. It shows commented-out code which suggests earlier versions used `localStorage` to store selected packages under the `distributionPackages` key.  However, the commented out code was never reactivated. This implies that the functionality to save and load package selections was removed or temporarily disabled during the observed period.

`DistributionUpgrades.js` (11:58:52 AM, 12:00:37 PM, 12:03:33 PM, 12:11:34 PM, 12:12:40 PM):  This component, handling optional distribution upgrades, underwent significant changes. Initially, it stored selected upgrades in `localStorage` using the `distributionUpgrades` key. Later revisions refactored this to store upgrade selections within the `pressRelease` object in `localStorage`, aligning it with the changes in `BrandStory.js`. The final version includes a confirmation popup after the quote request and removes all press release data (`pressRelease`) from `localStorage` after 5 seconds.  A key improvement is error handling during `localStorage` access, preventing potential crashes.

`NonDisclaimer.js` (12:13:25 PM, 12:13:34 PM, 12:14:04 PM): This component, responsible for the non-disclaimer distribution flow, was updated to remove the `pressRelease` data from `localStorage` after a quote request. Earlier versions had a bug where it attempted to remove data using an empty string (`localStorage.removeItem('')`).  This error was corrected in subsequent commits.


Recurring pattern: The most significant pattern is the refactoring of `localStorage` usage.  There is a clear shift toward consolidating all press release data within a single `pressRelease` object instead of using separate keys for different parts of the process.  This suggests an improvement in data organization and management within the application.  The consistent use of `setTimeout` to clear `localStorage` after 5 seconds indicates a design choice to immediately confirm the request, then to clean up the user's selection data to prepare for the next request.
