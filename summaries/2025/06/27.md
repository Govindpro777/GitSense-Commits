# Activity Summary for 6/27/2025

## 7:30:32 AM
The log shows updates to two React components: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent modifications at 5:42:30 PM and 5:46:27 PM.  The initial update at 5:42:30 PM involved a significant amount of code related to displaying and editing email previews. The component allows users to preview and edit email content, manage attachments, and includes placeholders for influencer details, campaign brief and deliverables. The later update at 5:46:27 PM included a minor change: importing `Editable` from `@chakra-ui/react`, likely to enhance the component's editing capabilities. This suggests a shift toward using Chakra UI for styling and component building.


`Shortlist.jsx` was updated twice, at 5:43:30 PM and 5:44:30 PM.  Both updates involved substantial changes to a React component displaying a shortlist of creators. The component fetches data using `userService`, filters creators based on search terms, verification status, and contact information availability.  It also includes features for selecting creators, displaying a loading state, and handling cases where no results are found. The two updates appear to be minor refinements or bug fixes, as the overall functionality seems consistent across both versions.  The changes were within seconds of each other indicating rapid iteration. Both versions make use of local storage to store shortlisted IDs ("shortlisted-ids").  There is also API interaction with endpoints like `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA`, `GET_DRAFT_DATA`, and `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`.  The use of  `useNotification` suggests integration with a notification system for user feedback.


## 8:30:33 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Narratives.tsx` file between 5:28 PM and 5:37 PM on June 26, 2025.  All revisions contain the same commented-out code, suggesting a work in progress or experimentation. The commented code defines a React component (`CombinedNarratives`) that displays a line chart using `react-apexcharts` and a section showing narrative data.  The chart visualizes narrative mentions over time, while the narrative section displays details like sentiment, count, title, author, sources, publication, category, sub-category, location, description, and links for each narrative.  The data displayed focuses on "Groww Receives CCI Approval for Bonus Shares and Voting Rights Restructuring". There are no substantial code changes between the revisions; the commented-out code remains consistent across all timestamps.  The repeated, identical code suggests the developer may have been trying different approaches or debugging, rather than incrementally adding features.


## 8:30:35 AM
The log shows several revisions to React components within a Next.js application, focusing on the `DeliverableRow` and `EmailPreview` components, between 7:57 AM and 8:30 AM on June 27, 2025.

**`DeliverableRow.jsx`:**  The main changes in `DeliverableRow.jsx` involve how content is handled.  Initially, the component rendered a simple row with an "Add content" button and a dropdown for "Brand Rights."  Later revisions significantly altered content management.  A key improvement was the introduction of a conditional rendering to display either existing content or a textarea for editing/adding content. The initial version had a flaw where changes in `item.quantity` didn't correctly update the `content` array. This was addressed in a subsequent commit at 8:07 AM by introducing a conditional check for the existence and structure of `item.content` before falling back to `Array(item.quantity).fill("")`. Further modifications at 8:16 AM and 8:29 AM added a mechanism to notify the parent component (`CampaignOutreach.jsx`) of content changes via the `onContentChange` prop. The final version included better handling of content length and a more user-friendly display of existing content (truncating long strings).

**`CampaignOutreach.jsx`:**  This component, which seems to be the parent component for `DeliverableRow`, was heavily commented out in two consecutive revisions. This suggests a temporary disabling or restructuring of the code at 8:11 AM. The comments include many imports, state variables and functions, indicating a significant component handling campaign outreach functionality like fetching content types, durations, handling attachments and email quota, and scheduling.  No functional changes were made in the subsequent revision at 8:29 AM.


**`EmailPreview.jsx`:**  This component displays a preview of an email.  There were multiple revisions to improve the generation of the email content, specifically how deliverables and campaign brief are incorporated. The early versions (8:13 AM and 8:14 AM) used `generateDeliverableTable` function to create a markdown-style table for deliverables. The function was enhanced at 8:14 AM to handle cases where a deliverable item might have multiple content entries, generating separate rows for each non-empty content. A later revision at 8:28 AM completely commented out the component, indicating a possible temporary removal or refactoring. The last revision before commenting out included enhancements to the handling of attachments,  adding the ability to remove both new and existing attached files, and improved the edit mode implementation by using a textarea, adding the possibility of editing each section of the email template and making it more user friendly by preserving the original structure and format of the email text.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

*   Several commits involved commenting out large portions of code, suggesting iterative development and refactoring.
*   Consistent use of functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) is prevalent.
*   A consistent design pattern is applied regarding error handling using `useNotification` for user feedback.
*   The code utilizes a significant number of inline styles within the JSX.


In summary, the code changes reflect an iterative process of building and improving the UI components for managing deliverables and composing email previews within a campaign creation workflow.  The focus is on enhancing user experience and improving data handling, notably in how the quantity of deliverables and their associated content are managed.


## 11:26:37 AM
The codebase primarily involves React components for managing and displaying email previews within a social media campaign outreach tool.  Significant changes occurred between 10:34 AM and 11:24 AM on June 27, 2025.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent the most revisions. Initially, it was a commented-out component.  Subsequent commits added functionality for:

* **Email content editing:**  An editable email preview was implemented, allowing users to modify various sections (greeting, introduction, call to action, etc.).  The component handles saving and editing modes.
* **Deliverable table generation:** A table dynamically displays deliverables based on provided data (contentType, quantity, duration).
* **Attachment handling:** The component displays attached images and allows for their removal.  This functionality interacts with a `onRemoveAttachment` prop.
* **Subject line input:** A dedicated input field is added for the subject line of the email.
* **Influencer list display:** A section shows a list of influencers the email will be sent to.

The `EmailContent.jsx` component evolved to handle rich text formatting within the email preview, specifically to render Markdown-like formatting (bold, italic, bullet points) and tables. A notable change replaced `<br/>` tags with a custom '||LINEBREAK||' separator for improved table cell line break handling.

`DeliverableRow.jsx` was modified to allow editing and deleting of deliverables. Importantly, a `onContentChange` prop was added to pass content changes to a parent component.  This suggests a two-way data binding between `DeliverableRow` and the component that uses it.

`CampaignOutreach.jsx` is a parent component that manages campaign details and interacts with API calls for fetching content types, durations, and attachments. It interacts with the other components, managing their states and props. This component handles user interaction and API integration for a campaign.  The file includes logic to prevent sending the email when insufficient email quota is available.  This file also makes several API calls to fetch and save data, leveraging axios for HTTP requests and likely uses a token-based authentication.


The frequent changes in `EmailPreview.jsx` indicate iterative development and refinement of the email preview functionality. The commented-out code sections suggest a history of experimentation and refactoring.  The consistent use of  `useState` and `useEffect` hooks throughout the React components demonstrates effective use of React's state management features.
