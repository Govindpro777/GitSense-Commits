# Activity Summary for 6/27/2025

## 7:30:32 AM
The log shows updates to two React components: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent modifications at 5:42:30 PM and 5:46:27 PM.  The initial update at 5:42:30 PM involved a significant amount of code related to displaying and editing email previews. The component allows users to preview and edit email content, manage attachments, and includes placeholders for influencer details, campaign brief and deliverables. The later update at 5:46:27 PM included a minor change: importing `Editable` from `@chakra-ui/react`, likely to enhance the component's editing capabilities. This suggests a shift toward using Chakra UI for styling and component building.


`Shortlist.jsx` was updated twice, at 5:43:30 PM and 5:44:30 PM.  Both updates involved substantial changes to a React component displaying a shortlist of creators. The component fetches data using `userService`, filters creators based on search terms, verification status, and contact information availability.  It also includes features for selecting creators, displaying a loading state, and handling cases where no results are found. The two updates appear to be minor refinements or bug fixes, as the overall functionality seems consistent across both versions.  The changes were within seconds of each other indicating rapid iteration. Both versions make use of local storage to store shortlisted IDs ("shortlisted-ids").  There is also API interaction with endpoints like `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA`, `GET_DRAFT_DATA`, and `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`.  The use of  `useNotification` suggests integration with a notification system for user feedback.


## 8:30:33 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Narratives.tsx` file between 5:28 PM and 5:37 PM on June 26, 2025.  All revisions contain the same commented-out code, suggesting a work in progress or experimentation. The commented code defines a React component (`CombinedNarratives`) that displays a line chart using `react-apexcharts` and a section showing narrative data.  The chart visualizes narrative mentions over time, while the narrative section displays details like sentiment, count, title, author, sources, publication, category, sub-category, location, description, and links for each narrative.  The data displayed focuses on "Groww Receives CCI Approval for Bonus Shares and Voting Rights Restructuring". There are no substantial code changes between the revisions; the commented-out code remains consistent across all timestamps.  The repeated, identical code suggests the developer may have been trying different approaches or debugging, rather than incrementally adding features.
