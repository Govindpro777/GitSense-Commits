# Activity Summary for 6/27/2025

## 7:30:32 AM
The log shows updates to two React components: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent modifications at 5:42:30 PM and 5:46:27 PM.  The initial update at 5:42:30 PM involved a significant amount of code related to displaying and editing email previews. The component allows users to preview and edit email content, manage attachments, and includes placeholders for influencer details, campaign brief and deliverables. The later update at 5:46:27 PM included a minor change: importing `Editable` from `@chakra-ui/react`, likely to enhance the component's editing capabilities. This suggests a shift toward using Chakra UI for styling and component building.


`Shortlist.jsx` was updated twice, at 5:43:30 PM and 5:44:30 PM.  Both updates involved substantial changes to a React component displaying a shortlist of creators. The component fetches data using `userService`, filters creators based on search terms, verification status, and contact information availability.  It also includes features for selecting creators, displaying a loading state, and handling cases where no results are found. The two updates appear to be minor refinements or bug fixes, as the overall functionality seems consistent across both versions.  The changes were within seconds of each other indicating rapid iteration. Both versions make use of local storage to store shortlisted IDs ("shortlisted-ids").  There is also API interaction with endpoints like `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA`, `GET_DRAFT_DATA`, and `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`.  The use of  `useNotification` suggests integration with a notification system for user feedback.


## 8:30:33 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Narratives.tsx` file between 5:28 PM and 5:37 PM on June 26, 2025.  All revisions contain the same commented-out code, suggesting a work in progress or experimentation. The commented code defines a React component (`CombinedNarratives`) that displays a line chart using `react-apexcharts` and a section showing narrative data.  The chart visualizes narrative mentions over time, while the narrative section displays details like sentiment, count, title, author, sources, publication, category, sub-category, location, description, and links for each narrative.  The data displayed focuses on "Groww Receives CCI Approval for Bonus Shares and Voting Rights Restructuring". There are no substantial code changes between the revisions; the commented-out code remains consistent across all timestamps.  The repeated, identical code suggests the developer may have been trying different approaches or debugging, rather than incrementally adding features.


## 8:30:35 AM
The log shows several revisions to React components within a Next.js application, focusing on the `DeliverableRow` and `EmailPreview` components, between 7:57 AM and 8:30 AM on June 27, 2025.

**`DeliverableRow.jsx`:**  The main changes in `DeliverableRow.jsx` involve how content is handled.  Initially, the component rendered a simple row with an "Add content" button and a dropdown for "Brand Rights."  Later revisions significantly altered content management.  A key improvement was the introduction of a conditional rendering to display either existing content or a textarea for editing/adding content. The initial version had a flaw where changes in `item.quantity` didn't correctly update the `content` array. This was addressed in a subsequent commit at 8:07 AM by introducing a conditional check for the existence and structure of `item.content` before falling back to `Array(item.quantity).fill("")`. Further modifications at 8:16 AM and 8:29 AM added a mechanism to notify the parent component (`CampaignOutreach.jsx`) of content changes via the `onContentChange` prop. The final version included better handling of content length and a more user-friendly display of existing content (truncating long strings).

**`CampaignOutreach.jsx`:**  This component, which seems to be the parent component for `DeliverableRow`, was heavily commented out in two consecutive revisions. This suggests a temporary disabling or restructuring of the code at 8:11 AM. The comments include many imports, state variables and functions, indicating a significant component handling campaign outreach functionality like fetching content types, durations, handling attachments and email quota, and scheduling.  No functional changes were made in the subsequent revision at 8:29 AM.


**`EmailPreview.jsx`:**  This component displays a preview of an email.  There were multiple revisions to improve the generation of the email content, specifically how deliverables and campaign brief are incorporated. The early versions (8:13 AM and 8:14 AM) used `generateDeliverableTable` function to create a markdown-style table for deliverables. The function was enhanced at 8:14 AM to handle cases where a deliverable item might have multiple content entries, generating separate rows for each non-empty content. A later revision at 8:28 AM completely commented out the component, indicating a possible temporary removal or refactoring. The last revision before commenting out included enhancements to the handling of attachments,  adding the ability to remove both new and existing attached files, and improved the edit mode implementation by using a textarea, adding the possibility of editing each section of the email template and making it more user friendly by preserving the original structure and format of the email text.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

*   Several commits involved commenting out large portions of code, suggesting iterative development and refactoring.
*   Consistent use of functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) is prevalent.
*   A consistent design pattern is applied regarding error handling using `useNotification` for user feedback.
*   The code utilizes a significant number of inline styles within the JSX.


In summary, the code changes reflect an iterative process of building and improving the UI components for managing deliverables and composing email previews within a campaign creation workflow.  The focus is on enhancing user experience and improving data handling, notably in how the quantity of deliverables and their associated content are managed.


## 11:26:37 AM
The codebase primarily involves React components for managing and displaying email previews within a social media campaign outreach tool.  Significant changes occurred between 10:34 AM and 11:24 AM on June 27, 2025.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent the most revisions. Initially, it was a commented-out component.  Subsequent commits added functionality for:

* **Email content editing:**  An editable email preview was implemented, allowing users to modify various sections (greeting, introduction, call to action, etc.).  The component handles saving and editing modes.
* **Deliverable table generation:** A table dynamically displays deliverables based on provided data (contentType, quantity, duration).
* **Attachment handling:** The component displays attached images and allows for their removal.  This functionality interacts with a `onRemoveAttachment` prop.
* **Subject line input:** A dedicated input field is added for the subject line of the email.
* **Influencer list display:** A section shows a list of influencers the email will be sent to.

The `EmailContent.jsx` component evolved to handle rich text formatting within the email preview, specifically to render Markdown-like formatting (bold, italic, bullet points) and tables. A notable change replaced `<br/>` tags with a custom '||LINEBREAK||' separator for improved table cell line break handling.

`DeliverableRow.jsx` was modified to allow editing and deleting of deliverables. Importantly, a `onContentChange` prop was added to pass content changes to a parent component.  This suggests a two-way data binding between `DeliverableRow` and the component that uses it.

`CampaignOutreach.jsx` is a parent component that manages campaign details and interacts with API calls for fetching content types, durations, and attachments. It interacts with the other components, managing their states and props. This component handles user interaction and API integration for a campaign.  The file includes logic to prevent sending the email when insufficient email quota is available.  This file also makes several API calls to fetch and save data, leveraging axios for HTTP requests and likely uses a token-based authentication.


The frequent changes in `EmailPreview.jsx` indicate iterative development and refinement of the email preview functionality. The commented-out code sections suggest a history of experimentation and refactoring.  The consistent use of  `useState` and `useEffect` hooks throughout the React components demonstrates effective use of React's state management features.


## 12:25:16 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `Narratives.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`, both within the `Skribe-Backend` project, on June 27th, 2025.

**`Narratives.tsx`:**  This file underwent two significant updates. The first, at 11:54:04 AM, involved the initial implementation of components to display narratives, including a line chart visualizing narrative timelines and a section for displaying individual narrative details like headline, summary, sentiment, authors, mentioned outlets, and article links.  The second update, at 11:58:54 AM, focused on refinements to the layout and display of author information, improving the visual presentation of author lists.  Both revisions extensively utilize React components for rendering the UI, and the code consistently applies a specific styling scheme using inline styles and Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design.

**`BrandSummary.tsx`:** This file was updated four times between 11:54:56 AM and 11:58:08 AM. The changes primarily center around creating a React component to display a brand summary using several charts: a bar chart for top publications, a donut chart for regional mentions, and another donut chart showing the quality of mentions.  The initial versions (11:54:56 AM and 11:55:53 AM) show incremental development and debugging, including the introduction of dummy data for testing. A `shortenOutletName` function was introduced to truncate long publication names for better display.  Later updates (11:57:28 AM and 11:57:39 AM) improved the code's structure and added  a sentiment score calculation and visualization. The final revision (11:58:08 AM) completed the UI implementation by integrating the charts into a grid layout.   Consistent use of React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`), ReactApexChart for chart rendering, and dummy data for development and testing are observed.  The code also features functions to transform and prepare data for charting.  A pattern of using dummy data until actual data is available is noticeable in the evolution of this file.


## 1:26:38 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EmailPreview.jsx` and one commented-out `CampaignOutreach.jsx` file.  The `EmailPreview.jsx` file underwent significant changes related to the rendering and editing of email content, specifically focusing on the display of deliverables.

Initially (11:27:01 AM), the component displayed email content and attachments, with a `generateDeliverableTable` function generating a table of deliverables from `deliverables` and `deliverableContents` data. This function was improved upon in subsequent commits, addressing edge cases like empty description and handling of data types.


At 11:27:40 AM a `console.log` statement was added for debugging purposes, logging the `deliverableContents` object.  Further refinements to the `generateDeliverableTable` function (11:29:45 AM, 11:37:30 AM, 11:39:58 AM, 11:40:21 AM) improved the handling of array and string data within the descriptions, removing empty strings and handling cases where description data is not available.  Additional logging was introduced at 11:37:30 AM to debug the keys and values passed to the function.  The table structure was simplified at 11:41:08 AM and changed again at 11:44:33 AM, to remove `deliverableContents` from the parameter list.

At 11:44:33 AM, the `deliverableContents` prop was removed from `EmailPreview.jsx`, indicating a change in data flow.  The  `generateDeliverableTable` function was significantly altered at 11:47:23 AM to include Serial Number and to handle content as an array of strings for better readability using `<br>`.  This was again altered at 11:50:18 AM and 11:51:22 AM,  modifying how content within the deliverable table was presented. Finally, at 11:51:48 AM the content display was changed once again to ensure that content is shown properly with line numbers.

The 11:45:54 AM revision removed `deliverableContents` as a prop completely from `EmailPreview.jsx` implying a restructuring of how this data is handled. The `generateDeliverableTable` function was also simplified to show only deliverable data without detailed descriptions.

A new `EmailContent.jsx` component was introduced at 11:51:57 AM to handle the formatting of the email content (including tables), improving code structure and readability.


The commented-out `CampaignOutreach.jsx` file (11:43:48 AM, 11:44:13 AM, 11:52:59 AM) suggests this component is either being temporarily disabled or is undergoing a major rewrite. It was fully implemented at 12:37:19 PM.

The `constants.js` file was updated at 12:33:52 PM, but the changes are not detailed, only showing API URLs which was not included in the summary.


The final `EmailPreview.jsx` version (12:53:53 PM) shows the entire component commented out, possibly indicating the component is temporarily unused or being completely refactored.  The changes show a focus on improving the handling and display of deliverable data and improving overall code structure.  The introduction of the `EmailContent.jsx` component reflects a step towards better organization.


## 2:26:26 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EmailPreview.jsx` on June 27th, 2025.  All revisions between 1:35 PM and 1:48 PM appear to be minor edits with no substantial changes to the overall code structure or functionality. The code is a React component that renders an email preview, allowing users to edit the content and manage attached images.  The component handles different email sections (greeting, introduction, call to action, etc.),  dynamically generates a deliverables table based on incoming `deliverables` props, and includes functionality to add/remove attachments. The UI is styled using a combination of inline styles and class names suggesting a Tailwind CSS framework. No changes to core logic or structure were observed throughout the logged revisions.


## 3:25:15 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `BrandReport.tsx` file, focusing on PDF generation and email functionality.  The initial revisions involved experimenting with different PDF generation approaches, starting with a simpler method of generating a single PDF from multiple sections  (`combined.pdf`), and later evolving into a more sophisticated method that handles page breaks and adjusts to different section heights within an A4 sized PDF (`brand-report.pdf`).  The final revision of `BrandReport.tsx` (timestamp 6/27/2025, 3:05:41 PM) implements a `generatePdfBlob` function that creates a PDF blob suitable for sending via an API call,  incorporating the `html2canvas` library for converting HTML sections into images for the PDF. The `handleSendReport` function is updated to use this blob for sending the report to the client via  the `/send-client-report` API endpoint.

`Narratives2.tsx` (6/27/2025, 3:00:02 PM) contains React code that renders a section displaying narrative data, including title, author, source, publication, date, description and links. The data is structured as an array of objects with consistent fields.  The component uses conditional styling based on sentiment (positive or negative).

`Narratives.tsx` (6/27/2025, 3:00:39 PM) also contains React code, which renders a section containing a line chart visualization of narrative mentions over time, along with a summary of the first narrative in the dataset.  The chart is built using `react-apexcharts`. The component utilizes functions to calculate chart dimensions dynamically and apply styling based on sentiment.  The code shows repeated patterns in how it handles data and applies styling for things like sentiment and mentions.


## 5:25:17 PM
The log shows multiple updates to React components and a PDF generation function across several files within a React project.  The primary focus seems to be on report generation and emailing functionalities.

**`GenerateReport.tsx` (6/27/2025, 3:47:40 PM):** This component handles the generation of a monthly report PDF.  It fetches data from multiple API endpoints (`/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/MonthlyReportSearchGraph`, `/MonthlyReportCampaignGraph`, `/MonthlyUserWisePerfomance`, `/MonthlyTop3Campaigns`, `/MonthlyComparisonLastSixMonths`) using `userService.get()`.  The PDF generation utilizes `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` to convert HTML sections into a PDF.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to handling pagination for the PDF report and also includes emailing functionality using `userService.postFormData('/send-client-report')` to send the generated PDF. The component also uses SweetAlert2 for user confirmations and feedback.

**`Narratives.tsx` (Multiple timestamps):** This component displays narratives data, including charts and individual narrative details. The component underwent several revisions, primarily concerning small adjustments to styling (height of header sections) within the component’s rendering. The core functionality remained consistent throughout the edits. This component uses `ReactApexChart` to render a line chart visualizing narrative timelines. It styles the narrative display based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

**`BrandReport.tsx` (6/27/2025, 3:52:11 PM and 6/27/2025, 3:52:37 PM):**  This component is similar to `GenerateReport.tsx` but focuses on generating Brand Reports. It also uses `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` for PDF generation but has a revised approach, dynamically adjusting the PDF page size to match the content.  It fetches data from `/AIBrandReport` which seems to provide brand-specific report details and `/MonthlyReportDetails`.  It also shares the email sending functionality with `GenerateReport.tsx`.  The earlier version used `a4` format, the later version dynamically adjusts the PDF size based on content.


**`UsageAndPerformance.tsx` (Multiple timestamps):** This component displays usage and performance statistics.  It uses `useMemo` to optimize the rendering of report data which is fetched as `data` prop.  This component received several minor updates focused primarily on adjusting padding (`p-4`, `p-6`) in the overall styling.  There are no functional changes to the component's logic or data processing.


There is a recurring pattern of using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` for PDF generation across multiple components.  The `userService` is consistently used for API calls, suggesting a common service layer for data fetching.  The styling consistently uses tailwind CSS classes.  The use of `sweetalert2-react-content` is consistent for user interactions.  Multiple components (`GenerateReport.tsx`, `BrandReport.tsx`) share nearly identical emailing functionality for sending reports.


## 5:26:28 PM
The `EmailPreview.jsx` component underwent significant changes between 5:01:58 PM and 5:10:49 PM on June 27, 2025.  Initially, the component was a static email preview with hardcoded content.  Subsequent commits introduced functionality to fetch and display email draft data dynamically.

**Key Changes:**

* **Data Fetching (5:10:49 PM):** The most substantial change involved integrating a data fetching mechanism using `userService.get(`${GET_DRAFT_DATA}/${campId}`)`. This retrieves draft data based on a `campId` prop, dynamically populating the email preview with information such as brand name, campaign title, deliverables, and attachments.  A loading indicator (`Loader` component) was added to improve user experience during data retrieval. Error handling was also implemented to gracefully handle failed data fetches.

* **Dynamic Content Population:**  The component now dynamically generates email content (`generateFullEmailContent`) using data fetched from the API. This includes a table of deliverables and uses placeholders that are dynamically replaced with data from the fetched draft.  The introduction section is dynamically updated to reflect the campaign's brand and title.

* **Attachment Handling:** The handling of attachments changed to use the `draftData.attachments` array, allowing for dynamic display and removal of attached files. The logic for determining if an attachment is a PDF also improved using `.endsWith('.pdf')` check on the `vchattachmentid`.


* **Removal of Unnecessary Props:** Props like `attachedImages`, `campaignBrief`, and `deliverables` were removed as they are now fetched dynamically.  The component now only requires `onClose` and `campId` as props.

* **Error Handling (5:10:49 PM):** A fallback message was implemented to display an error if the campaign data fails to load, enhancing the robustness of the component.

* **Code Cleanup:** While the core functionality changed drastically, the code remained well-structured and organized throughout the modifications.


The changes exhibit a clear pattern of transforming a static component into a dynamic one, capable of rendering email previews based on data retrieved from a backend service.  The consistent use of functional components and React hooks reflects best practices in modern React development.
