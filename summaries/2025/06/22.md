# Activity Summary for 6/22/2025

## 12:07:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `OrderFilesTab.jsx` and `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`.  Both are related to displaying and managing order details and associated files in an admin panel.


`OrderFilesTab.jsx`: This component underwent significant styling and structural changes throughout the log.  Early versions showed basic file display and download functionality.  Later versions, starting around 11:18 PM, introduced a more sophisticated layout using a `FileSection` component (not shown in the log, but implied by the code) to organize CAD files, images, and text files into separate sections within cards.  The styling evolved from simpler layouts to more advanced card-based displays with improved visual hierarchy and hover effects. The spacing between file sections was adjusted multiple times (`space-y-4` then `space-y-6`, then back to `space-y-4`).  The timestamps 11:18:19 PM, 11:19:34 PM, and 11:20:24 PM mark key revisions in the styling and structure of this component.  Finally, all the later revisions (from 11:25 PM onwards) are commented out, suggesting that the final, functional version is the one from 11:20:24 PM.


`OrderDetailsModal.jsx`: This component, a modal displaying order details, remained relatively stable in its structure. The primary change between the first and second versions (11:10:56 PM and 11:12:26 PM) was the addition of functionality for assigning orders to "Cutout" users, including fetching a list of cutout users, handling the assignment process using `axios`, and displaying success/error messages.  This involved adding state variables (`cutoutUsers`, `selectedCutoutUser`, etc.) and functions (`fetchCutoutUsers`, `handleAssignOrder`). There is also a significant addition of order status update functionality through an API call using `fetch`.  Additionally, the first version was commented out in the later revision.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development, with `OrderFilesTab.jsx` focusing on UI/UX improvements and `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` adding new features related to order assignment and status updates.  The recurring element is the use of `fetch` and `localStorage.getItem("token")` for API calls, indicating consistent authentication and data fetching mechanisms. The use of `axios` in the second version of `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` is noteworthy, as it suggests a potential shift in the preferred HTTP client library.


## 12:37:32 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `UploadedFilesModal.jsx` and `FileUploadModal.jsx`.  Both files underwent several edits, with some revisions completely commenting out the entire file content, suggesting potential experimentation or temporary removal of functionality.

`UploadedFilesModal.jsx`: This component displays uploaded files (images, CAD files, and text files), allowing users to download and delete them.  The component fetches file data using a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/cutout/getCadFilesAndPhoto` and deletes files using a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/graphics/deleteCadFile`. Both endpoints require authentication via a token stored in `localStorage`.  The file includes extensive UI elements for displaying the files and managing deletion, including a confirmation modal.  Changes to this file are frequent, with multiple versions being entirely commented out between 11:39 AM and 12:20 PM. A later edit at 12:14 PM added a constant `IMAGE_SEARCH_API` from environment variables, but this was subsequently commented out  at 12:15 PM and 12:17 PM.

`FileUploadModal.jsx`: This component handles file uploads. It allows users to select CAD files, images, and text files for upload, providing feedback on selected files and upload status. The upload is performed using a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/fileupload`, also using an authentication token from `localStorage`. All revisions for this file are entirely commented out, indicating it was likely disabled or temporarily removed at 12:27 PM and 12:33 PM and 12:37 PM.


The most significant changes occurred between 11:39 AM and 12:20 AM for `UploadedFilesModal.jsx` and at 12:27 PM for `FileUploadModal.jsx`, where entire file contents were commented out.  The overall pattern indicates iterative development and potential troubleshooting, with a focus on file management and UI improvements in `UploadedFilesModal.jsx` and file upload functionality in `FileUploadModal.jsx`.
