# Activity Summary for 6/22/2025

## 12:07:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `OrderFilesTab.jsx` and `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`.  Both are related to displaying and managing order details and associated files in an admin panel.


`OrderFilesTab.jsx`: This component underwent significant styling and structural changes throughout the log.  Early versions showed basic file display and download functionality.  Later versions, starting around 11:18 PM, introduced a more sophisticated layout using a `FileSection` component (not shown in the log, but implied by the code) to organize CAD files, images, and text files into separate sections within cards.  The styling evolved from simpler layouts to more advanced card-based displays with improved visual hierarchy and hover effects. The spacing between file sections was adjusted multiple times (`space-y-4` then `space-y-6`, then back to `space-y-4`).  The timestamps 11:18:19 PM, 11:19:34 PM, and 11:20:24 PM mark key revisions in the styling and structure of this component.  Finally, all the later revisions (from 11:25 PM onwards) are commented out, suggesting that the final, functional version is the one from 11:20:24 PM.


`OrderDetailsModal.jsx`: This component, a modal displaying order details, remained relatively stable in its structure. The primary change between the first and second versions (11:10:56 PM and 11:12:26 PM) was the addition of functionality for assigning orders to "Cutout" users, including fetching a list of cutout users, handling the assignment process using `axios`, and displaying success/error messages.  This involved adding state variables (`cutoutUsers`, `selectedCutoutUser`, etc.) and functions (`fetchCutoutUsers`, `handleAssignOrder`). There is also a significant addition of order status update functionality through an API call using `fetch`.  Additionally, the first version was commented out in the later revision.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development, with `OrderFilesTab.jsx` focusing on UI/UX improvements and `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` adding new features related to order assignment and status updates.  The recurring element is the use of `fetch` and `localStorage.getItem("token")` for API calls, indicating consistent authentication and data fetching mechanisms. The use of `axios` in the second version of `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` is noteworthy, as it suggests a potential shift in the preferred HTTP client library.


## 12:37:32 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `UploadedFilesModal.jsx` and `FileUploadModal.jsx`.  Both files underwent several edits, with some revisions completely commenting out the entire file content, suggesting potential experimentation or temporary removal of functionality.

`UploadedFilesModal.jsx`: This component displays uploaded files (images, CAD files, and text files), allowing users to download and delete them.  The component fetches file data using a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/cutout/getCadFilesAndPhoto` and deletes files using a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/graphics/deleteCadFile`. Both endpoints require authentication via a token stored in `localStorage`.  The file includes extensive UI elements for displaying the files and managing deletion, including a confirmation modal.  Changes to this file are frequent, with multiple versions being entirely commented out between 11:39 AM and 12:20 PM. A later edit at 12:14 PM added a constant `IMAGE_SEARCH_API` from environment variables, but this was subsequently commented out  at 12:15 PM and 12:17 PM.

`FileUploadModal.jsx`: This component handles file uploads. It allows users to select CAD files, images, and text files for upload, providing feedback on selected files and upload status. The upload is performed using a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/fileupload`, also using an authentication token from `localStorage`. All revisions for this file are entirely commented out, indicating it was likely disabled or temporarily removed at 12:27 PM and 12:33 PM and 12:37 PM.


The most significant changes occurred between 11:39 AM and 12:20 AM for `UploadedFilesModal.jsx` and at 12:27 PM for `FileUploadModal.jsx`, where entire file contents were commented out.  The overall pattern indicates iterative development and potential troubleshooting, with a focus on file management and UI improvements in `UploadedFilesModal.jsx` and file upload functionality in `FileUploadModal.jsx`.


## 5:00:37 PM
The provided log shows changes to two files: `FileUploadModal.jsx` and `Sidebar.jsx`.  There were three updates to `FileUploadModal.jsx` within a short time frame (12:40 PM, 12:46 PM, and 12:51 PM).  The content of `FileUploadModal.jsx` remained largely unchanged across these revisions; the differences are not apparent in the provided diffs, suggesting minor, inconsequential alterations.  The file implements a modal for uploading CAD files, images, and optionally text files. It features file selection, preview, removal, and upload functionality, including validation to ensure at least one CAD and one image file are selected before upload.  The upload uses a POST request to a backend API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/fileupload`), utilizing a token from local storage for authorization.  Error and success messages are displayed using `react-hot-toast`.


The `Sidebar.jsx` file was updated once at 4:47 PM. This component renders a sidebar menu with different options depending on the user's account type (`SuperAdmin`, `Admin`, `Graphics`, `Cutout`, `Accounts`, `Display`), which is retrieved from local storage. The sidebar uses `lucide-react` icons and `react-router-dom` for navigation.  A logout button removes the authentication token and account type from local storage and redirects to the login page.  The sidebar's responsiveness is handled using CSS classes to control its visibility based on screen size and a `toggleSidebar` function.  The active menu item is dynamically highlighted based on the current URL.


## 8:09:15 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `ImageSearch.jsx` file between 7:47 PM and 8:02 PM on June 22, 2025.  No code changes were actually made across all the revisions; the code remains identical in all entries.  The file is a React component handling image search and upload functionality. It interacts with a backend API (accessed via `API_BASE_URL`,  obtained from an environment variable) for image listing, adding, and searching. The component manages state for uploaded images, search results, loading status, errors, success messages, pagination, and view modes.  Image uploads are validated for type and size.  When adding images to the database, it fetches the existing image count to generate a sequential filename. Error messages are automatically cleared after a timeout period (8000ms for errors, 5000ms for success messages).  The repeated identical code entries suggest that the timestamps may reflect failed attempts to save changes or other system-level logging rather than actual code modifications.


## 9:09:14 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files within a short time frame on June 22nd, 2025.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Backend\index.js` was updated once at 8:52:10 PM. This file is a backend server using Express.js, Socket.IO, and various middleware for authentication and file uploads.  The key change appears to be a refined CORS configuration, moving from a simpler `allowedOrigins` array to a function-based approach that dynamically checks if the origin is allowed. This enhances security by explicitly defining allowed origins instead of allowing all origins.  The server also includes routes for users, admins, designers, super admins, accounts, invoices, and challans, indicating a multi-role application managing various types of data.  Socket.IO is implemented for real-time communication, with middleware for authentication and a socket manager for user connection tracking.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend\src\components\GraphicsOrder\UploadedFilesModal.jsx` underwent several updates between 8:59:18 PM and 9:07:40 PM. This React component is a modal for displaying and managing uploaded files (images, CAD files, and text files) associated with a graphics order. The repeated updates suggest iterative refinement and bug fixing, rather than substantial functional changes.  The code is commented-out, indicating a work-in-progress state, possibly reflecting development or debugging steps. The component fetches file data using `fetch` requests, handles file deletion with confirmation dialogs, and provides download capabilities. The repeated updates likely involve adjustments to error handling, UI elements, or minor logic improvements based on testing.  The `baseUrl` variable is used to construct API calls suggesting this component interacts with a backend service.
