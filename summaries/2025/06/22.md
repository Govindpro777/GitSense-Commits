# Activity Summary for 6/22/2025

## 12:07:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `OrderFilesTab.jsx` and `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`.  Both are related to displaying and managing order details and associated files in an admin panel.


`OrderFilesTab.jsx`: This component underwent significant styling and structural changes throughout the log.  Early versions showed basic file display and download functionality.  Later versions, starting around 11:18 PM, introduced a more sophisticated layout using a `FileSection` component (not shown in the log, but implied by the code) to organize CAD files, images, and text files into separate sections within cards.  The styling evolved from simpler layouts to more advanced card-based displays with improved visual hierarchy and hover effects. The spacing between file sections was adjusted multiple times (`space-y-4` then `space-y-6`, then back to `space-y-4`).  The timestamps 11:18:19 PM, 11:19:34 PM, and 11:20:24 PM mark key revisions in the styling and structure of this component.  Finally, all the later revisions (from 11:25 PM onwards) are commented out, suggesting that the final, functional version is the one from 11:20:24 PM.


`OrderDetailsModal.jsx`: This component, a modal displaying order details, remained relatively stable in its structure. The primary change between the first and second versions (11:10:56 PM and 11:12:26 PM) was the addition of functionality for assigning orders to "Cutout" users, including fetching a list of cutout users, handling the assignment process using `axios`, and displaying success/error messages.  This involved adding state variables (`cutoutUsers`, `selectedCutoutUser`, etc.) and functions (`fetchCutoutUsers`, `handleAssignOrder`). There is also a significant addition of order status update functionality through an API call using `fetch`.  Additionally, the first version was commented out in the later revision.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development, with `OrderFilesTab.jsx` focusing on UI/UX improvements and `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` adding new features related to order assignment and status updates.  The recurring element is the use of `fetch` and `localStorage.getItem("token")` for API calls, indicating consistent authentication and data fetching mechanisms. The use of `axios` in the second version of `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` is noteworthy, as it suggests a potential shift in the preferred HTTP client library.
