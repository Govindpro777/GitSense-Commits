# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 1:02:09 AM
The `TeacherList.js` file underwent two revisions on June 5th, 2025.  The primary change involves the addition of a `TeacherActionModal` component. This modal, triggered by clicking a teacher card, allows users to either "Book Demo Class" or "Buy Full Course."  The modal displays the selected teacher's name and provides informative descriptions of each action.  A minor style change occurred in the second revision: the background opacity of the modal was adjusted from `bg-black bg-opacity-50` to `bg-black/40`. The `TeacherList` component itself was modified to incorporate the modal;  the `onClick` handler for `TeacherCard` was updated to manage the modal's state and the addition of navigation to a payment route upon course purchase.  The first revision occurred at 12:58:23 AM, and the second, a minor style update, was made one minute later at 12:59:24 AM.  Both revisions maintain the core functionality of displaying a list of teachers and handling the selection of a teacher.


## 12:40:44 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `index.html` between 11:58 AM and 12:21 PM on June 5th, 2025.  The main content of the file remained consistent: an HTML page encouraging users to upgrade their Skribe account before their trial ends.  The page features a header with a logo, a main title, a description highlighting key features (Smart Analytics & Reporting, National Media Monitoring, Daily Skribe Clips, Press Release Distribution, and Regional & Vernacular Coverage), an upgrade offer, a call to action for a demo, and a footer with social media links.

The most significant changes involve the image sources. Initially, placeholder images (`via.placeholder.com`) were used.  Between 12:08 PM and 12:17 PM, these were replaced with images from "https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/".  Specifically, the logo, feature icons, and potentially a background image were updated. There were also several instances where the entire HTML code was commented out (`<!-- ... -->`) before the new version was added. This suggests an iterative process of updating the file, possibly due to testing or correcting image URLs. The final version, around 12:21 PM, appears to settle on using the images from `www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`.  There were no other substantial content alterations.


## 1:25:38 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Skribe-Frontend\public\index.html`.  The file is an HTML file for a website, likely for a company named Skribe, focused on media intelligence and PR automation.

The most significant changes occurred between 12:27 PM and 12:34 PM on June 5th, 2025.  These changes primarily involve modifications to the `<meta name="description">` and `<title>` tags.  Initially, the description was "Skribe | Real-Time Media Intelligen", and the title was "Skribe Media".  The description was then updated to reflect more detail about the platform's features and to include a tagline ("Indiaâ€™s #1 AI-powered media intelligence platform"). This more detailed version was later reverted back to a shorter description  "Skribe | Real-Time Media Intelligence", and the title was also reverted to "Skribe Media".  The title tag changes mirrored the description updates.

Throughout all revisions, commented-out sections of code remain consistent, suggesting the presence of Google Analytics (`gtag.js`), Clarity.ms analytics, and New Relic code (commented out as "[NOT NEEDED FOR NOW]"). The core HTML structure and the inclusion of  `Poppins` font remain constant across all revisions.  The commented-out JavaScript code snippets suggest that analytics tools were experimented with but not ultimately included in the final version.
