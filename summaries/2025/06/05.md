# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 1:02:09 AM
The `TeacherList.js` file underwent two revisions on June 5th, 2025.  The primary change involves the addition of a `TeacherActionModal` component. This modal, triggered by clicking a teacher card, allows users to either "Book Demo Class" or "Buy Full Course."  The modal displays the selected teacher's name and provides informative descriptions of each action.  A minor style change occurred in the second revision: the background opacity of the modal was adjusted from `bg-black bg-opacity-50` to `bg-black/40`. The `TeacherList` component itself was modified to incorporate the modal;  the `onClick` handler for `TeacherCard` was updated to manage the modal's state and the addition of navigation to a payment route upon course purchase.  The first revision occurred at 12:58:23 AM, and the second, a minor style update, was made one minute later at 12:59:24 AM.  Both revisions maintain the core functionality of displaying a list of teachers and handling the selection of a teacher.
