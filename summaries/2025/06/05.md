# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 1:02:09 AM
The `TeacherList.js` file underwent two revisions on June 5th, 2025.  The primary change involves the addition of a `TeacherActionModal` component. This modal, triggered by clicking a teacher card, allows users to either "Book Demo Class" or "Buy Full Course."  The modal displays the selected teacher's name and provides informative descriptions of each action.  A minor style change occurred in the second revision: the background opacity of the modal was adjusted from `bg-black bg-opacity-50` to `bg-black/40`. The `TeacherList` component itself was modified to incorporate the modal;  the `onClick` handler for `TeacherCard` was updated to manage the modal's state and the addition of navigation to a payment route upon course purchase.  The first revision occurred at 12:58:23 AM, and the second, a minor style update, was made one minute later at 12:59:24 AM.  Both revisions maintain the core functionality of displaying a list of teachers and handling the selection of a teacher.


## 12:40:44 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `index.html` between 11:58 AM and 12:21 PM on June 5th, 2025.  The main content of the file remained consistent: an HTML page encouraging users to upgrade their Skribe account before their trial ends.  The page features a header with a logo, a main title, a description highlighting key features (Smart Analytics & Reporting, National Media Monitoring, Daily Skribe Clips, Press Release Distribution, and Regional & Vernacular Coverage), an upgrade offer, a call to action for a demo, and a footer with social media links.

The most significant changes involve the image sources. Initially, placeholder images (`via.placeholder.com`) were used.  Between 12:08 PM and 12:17 PM, these were replaced with images from "https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/".  Specifically, the logo, feature icons, and potentially a background image were updated. There were also several instances where the entire HTML code was commented out (`<!-- ... -->`) before the new version was added. This suggests an iterative process of updating the file, possibly due to testing or correcting image URLs. The final version, around 12:21 PM, appears to settle on using the images from `www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`.  There were no other substantial content alterations.


## 1:25:38 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Skribe-Frontend\public\index.html`.  The file is an HTML file for a website, likely for a company named Skribe, focused on media intelligence and PR automation.

The most significant changes occurred between 12:27 PM and 12:34 PM on June 5th, 2025.  These changes primarily involve modifications to the `<meta name="description">` and `<title>` tags.  Initially, the description was "Skribe | Real-Time Media Intelligen", and the title was "Skribe Media".  The description was then updated to reflect more detail about the platform's features and to include a tagline ("Indiaâ€™s #1 AI-powered media intelligence platform"). This more detailed version was later reverted back to a shorter description  "Skribe | Real-Time Media Intelligence", and the title was also reverted to "Skribe Media".  The title tag changes mirrored the description updates.

Throughout all revisions, commented-out sections of code remain consistent, suggesting the presence of Google Analytics (`gtag.js`), Clarity.ms analytics, and New Relic code (commented out as "[NOT NEEDED FOR NOW]"). The core HTML structure and the inclusion of  `Poppins` font remain constant across all revisions.  The commented-out JavaScript code snippets suggest that analytics tools were experimented with but not ultimately included in the final version.


## 1:40:50 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `index.html` on June 5th, 2025, between 12:42 PM and 1:32 PM.  The main focus of the changes is the visual styling and image sourcing of an email or webpage promoting Skribe, a PR platform.

Initially, the HTML used placeholder images.  Between 12:42 PM and 12:46 PM, these placeholders were replaced with images from `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`.  Specifically, the logo and feature icons were updated. There were also some minor inconsistencies in the image URLs, for example `page-4-icon-2png` instead of `page-4-icon-2.png`, which were corrected.

Around 12:46 PM, a background image was added to the body using `background-image: url('https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/page-4-bg.png');`. The  `max-width` of the `.container` class was increased from 600px to 700px  at 12:53 PM, and the corresponding media query was also updated to reflect this.

Several subsequent edits involved adjustments to font sizes (particularly `.features-list`, `.feature-item`, `.description`, `.description-text`, `.tagline`, `.team-signature`, and `.footer` elements),  margin values (`.feature-item` and `.description`), and the `.feature-title` font weight.  The button text and the button's background color were also changed several times, from `#1e3a8a` to `#002B5B`.   The call to action button text was changed from "ðŸš€ Upgrade My Plan Now" to "ðŸ‘‰ Upgrade My Plan Now".

Finally, around 1:31 PM, the social media links in the footer were changed from simple `<img>` tags to `<a>` tags with actual URLs, indicating a functional update to make the links clickable.  The social media icon size was also reduced.  The final edit at 1:32 PM showed the removal of some commented-out code.  The overall pattern is iterative refinement of the visual presentation and a final step to add functional links to social media icons.


## 2:40:44 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files, `index.html` and `index2.html`, between 1:40 PM and 2:23 PM on June 5th, 2025.

`index.html` underwent several minor revisions.  The most significant change occurred around 1:42 PM, when placeholder links (`href="#"`) in the "Free Demo Call" and "Upgrade My Plan Now" buttons were replaced with  `https://calendly.com/growth-jangamedia/30min`.  Additionally, around 1:44 PM, the social media icons were modified to include links to Skribe's social media profiles, and a minor styling adjustment was made to the footer's `margin-bottom` property.  The content itself remained largely consistent, focusing on an upgrade offer for a Skribe trial nearing its end, highlighting key features like analytics, media monitoring, and press release distribution.

`index2.html` also experienced several revisions, primarily focused on styling and layout adjustments to the footer.  Between 2:05 PM and 2:07 PM, the height of the `.footer-bg` class was significantly reduced from 150px to 3px, and then increased again to 360px around 2:07 PM.  Around 2:14 PM, the footer's structure was refactored with a new `.footer-wrapper` and `.footer-bg-image` classes.  The content remained largely the same, promoting Skribe's features and encouraging users to resume its use.  The overall theme across both files is marketing and promotion of the Skribe platform.  The frequent, minor edits suggest an iterative process of refining the HTML structure and styling for optimal visual presentation.


## 3:23:47 PM
The `TeacherList.js` component was updated on June 5th, 2025 at 2:34:27 PM.  The update significantly revised the component's UI and functionality.  The changes include the addition of a modal (`TeacherActionModal`) that appears when a teacher is selected. This modal allows users to either "Book Demo Class" or "Buy Full Course".  The "Book Demo Class" option calls a provided `onTeacherSelect` function, presumably triggering further actions for demo booking. The "Buy Full Course" option redirects the user to a '/payment' route using `next/navigation`.

The component now handles cases where no teachers are available, displaying a message instead of rendering the teacher list.  The UI improvements involve using Lucide-React icons for visual cues and a consistent styling using Tailwind CSS classes.  The component's logic for handling teacher selection and modal display was significantly enhanced to provide a better user experience.  The core functionality revolves around selecting a teacher, presenting action options, and then either proceeding with a demo booking flow or navigating to a payment page.


## 3:40:45 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `index2.html` on June 5th, 2025, between approximately 3:25 PM and 3:39 PM.  The changes primarily involve adjustments to the HTML's styling, specifically within the CSS section.  There's a recurring pattern of commenting out and uncommenting large sections of the HTML code, suggesting experimentation with different layouts, particularly the footer section.  The main-title font size is repeatedly modified, starting at 32px, decreasing to 28px, then 2px, before settling on 28px again. The margin-bottom values of `.trial-text`, `.description-text` and `.cta-text` also show multiple alterations. The `.feature-item` margin-bottom is changed from 15px to 4px.  The most significant changes appear to be focused on refining the visual presentation of the email or webpage.  There is no consistent pattern in the order of these changes.


## 4:43:20 PM
The log shows extensive updates to the ExpertBuddy frontend across multiple components between 3:56 PM and 4:38 PM on June 5th, 2025.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\tutorProfilePage\index.jsx`: This file underwent a major revision.  The `TutorProfilePage` component was updated to fetch tutor data, including profile details, resume, booking status, ratings, and similar tutors, using `axiosInstance`.  It incorporates Redux for state management, uses cookies for authentication (`userId`, `jwtToken`), and handles favorite tutor functionality.  The UI includes a loading state and error handling.  The component also implements client-side navigation (`useRouter`, `usePathname`) and responsive design (`useScreenSize`). Significant changes were made to handle various popups for adding and scheduling lessons.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\tutorProfilePage\SubscriptionCard\index.jsx`: This component, `SubscriptionCard`, was updated to display tutor subscription information and offers actions like booking lessons, scheduling classes, adding lessons to a package, and sending messages.  It uses Redux and integrates with the `scheduleBookingRequest` API for lesson booking. The component also includes functionality for saving tutors to a favorite list and sharing tutor profiles. The changes occurred at approximately 3:57 PM.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutors\[SubjectName]\reviews\Rating.js` and `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutors\[SubjectName]\reviews\TutorProfile.js`:  These files initially contained commented-out code suggesting a previous implementation of a rating and tutor profile component.  Later commits introduced functional, updated versions of these components. The `TutorProfile` component now dynamically renders tutor information, using a default tutor object if no data is provided and supports both YouTube and local video display. This file was updated multiple times throughout the log, with the final version appearing at 4:38 PM.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutors\[SubjectName]\reviews\ReviewList.js`: This file (`ReviewList`) was updated to include a `Hero`, `Rating`, `TutorProfile`, `ReasonsToChoose`, `FAQHomework`, and `Footer` components. The component serves as the main layout for tutor reviews page.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\HomeClient.jsx`: This component (`HomeClient`) was updated to incorporate a more complex navigation system using `framer-motion` for animations. It includes a responsive floating action button for mobile navigation, a desktop sidebar, and an overlay for mobile navigation.  This component handles the display of several sections on the homepage (`ScheduleLessons`, `RecommendedTutors`, `PastConsultedTutors`, etc.), making use of IntersectionObserver to manage active section highlighting and smooth scrolling.  It also includes logic for registering FCM tokens for push notifications using `firebase` and updates user IP and timezone.  The updates occurred at approximately 4:15 PM.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\_components\BottomLandingPage\C3\index.jsx`: This file (`FAQs`) shows updates to a FAQ component that fetches and displays FAQs using `axiosInstance`. It uses an accordion structure to display the question and answers,  handles loading states, and includes a link to view all FAQs. The `renderAnswerWithLinks` function dynamically renders answers with embedded links.  The component was updated twice between 4:16 PM and 4:18 PM, with minor text changes.

A recurring pattern is the extensive use of `axiosInstance` for API calls, `React` for UI components, and `Redux` for state management across all the files.  The use of Next.js's `Link` component for internal navigation is also prevalent.  There's a focus on responsive design with CSS class names incorporating media queries.  The code demonstrates a clear structure and separation of concerns across different components.


## 6:43:13 PM
The log shows modifications to three React component files within a React application (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).  The changes primarily involve improvements to UI components for displaying tutor profiles and ratings.

`TutorProfile.js` underwent two updates within a short time frame (6/5/2025, 6:15:27 PM and 6/5/2025, 6:19:43 PM). The initial version used statically defined tutor data. The second version significantly improved the component by:

*   Accepting `tutorData` as a prop, allowing dynamic rendering of tutor information.
*   Implementing a default tutor object for cases where `tutorData` is null.
*   Adding error handling for the avatar image using an `onError` handler.
*   Increasing the size of the avatar image.
*   Introducing conditional rendering for the online status indicator.
*   Replacing static image placeholders with dynamic image URLs from `tutorData`.
*   Refactoring the styling for improved visual appearance (adding `shadow-lg`, `transition-all`, `duration-300`, `hover:shadow-xl`).
*   Most importantly, it changed the video preview section to support YouTube links alongside local video files.  This involved using an iframe for YouTube and a video tag for local files.
*   Changing the `View tutor's profile` button to a `next/link` component for better navigation.


`Rating.js` shows commented-out code throughout all revisions (6/5/2025, 6:24:17 PM, 6/5/2025, 6:24:57 PM, 6/5/2025, 6:34:31 PM, 6/5/2025, 6:35:41 PM).  The code suggests a component for displaying and managing tutor ratings, featuring:

*   Fetching reviews from an API (`/api/common/subject/reviews`) using `axiosInstance`.
*   Authentication using JWT tokens and user IDs.
*   Pagination for handling large review sets.
*   Rendering star ratings using React icons.
*   Sorting reviews based on different criteria ("Highest Rating", "Newest First", "Oldest First", "Lowest Rating").
*   Calculation of rating statistics (average, stars counts).
*   A `CommentCard` component to display individual reviews and tutor replies.
*   Displaying the time since a review was posted using `formatDistanceToNow`.


No substantial functional changes are observable in the `Rating.js` across the different timestamps.  The identical commented code across multiple timestamps suggests the component might be undergoing debugging or refactoring, rather than adding features.


## 7:43:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `TutorProfile.js` and `Rating.js` within a short timeframe on June 5th, 2025.  The `TutorProfile.js` file underwent significant changes, primarily focusing on improving the UI/UX of the tutor profile card.  Initial versions were commented out and replaced with a more refined version that uses props to dynamically display tutor information, including name, profile tag, verification status, avatar, introduction video (supporting YouTube links), experience, and credentials.  The introduction video section was improved to use either an iframe for YouTube links or a `<video>` tag for other video sources, enhancing flexibility.  A crucial update was the addition of  `Link` from `next/link` to make the "View tutor's Profile" button navigate correctly.  The final change involved correcting the link in the  `href` prop of the `Link` component to `/tutor/${tutor.slug}/book/${subjectName}` for proper routing.

The `Rating.js` file, while present in the log, shows multiple versions with no apparent changes in the code snippets provided.  Therefore, no specific changes to this component can be detailed based on this data.  The commented-out code suggests the component fetches and displays tutor reviews, including functionalities for sorting, pagination, and error handling, making use of the `TutorProfile` component and several external libraries.


## 8:43:08 PM
The log shows two revisions of `TutorRelatedSubjects.jsx`, a React component,  both made on June 5th, 2025.  The changes between the two revisions are minimal; the code is functionally identical. Both versions fetch subject suggestions from an API endpoint (`/api/common/subjects/suggestions`) using `axiosInstance`, handling both public and authenticated requests based on the presence of a `jwtToken` and `userId` cookie. The component renders these suggestions in a grid layout, using `HorizontalDottedLine` and `VerticalDottedLine` components for visual separation.  The `extractTutorInfo` function remains unchanged, parsing subject information from URLs and text.  The only notable difference is a minor timing difference in the timestamps (8:07 PM vs. 8:18 PM), suggesting a possible minor edit or save operation without any substantive code alteration.


## 9:29:11 PM
The log shows several React component updates across different files within a Learning Management System (LMS) application.  Significant changes occurred between 8:49 PM and 9:26 PM on June 5th, 2025.

`BookingDemo.js` underwent two major revisions. The first version (8:49 PM) is a largely commented-out component for booking demo classes, featuring course details fetching, teacher selection, slot booking, and student registration/login modals.  The commented-out code suggests it was likely undergoing significant refactoring. The second version (9:14 PM) removes the comments, adds a `showBookingPanel` state to control the visibility of the booking panel, modifies the `handleTeacherSelect` function to show this panel, and significantly enhances error handling in the `proceedWithBooking` function. The improved error handling now includes checking for pre-existing emails, and handles cases where a slot is already booked by refreshing the available slots.  The layout also adapts to display either a full-width view or a split layout (course details/teacher list on one side, booking panel on the other) based on the booking panel's visibility.

`TeacherList.js` (8:51 PM) introduces a `TeacherActionModal` component that allows users to either book a demo class or buy the full course for a selected teacher.  This modal is integrated into the `TeacherList` component, providing a cleaner user experience for selecting and interacting with teachers.

`CourseDashboard.jsx` (9:22 PM and 9:23 PM) shows minor edits between successive commits. The changes primarily involve refining the UI text in the "Add Course" button and cleaning up the code. This component displays a dashboard for managing courses, including searching, filtering, adding, editing, and deleting courses.  It uses a state management library (`useCourseStore`), pagination, and modals for creating and editing courses.  The use of `useCallback` for several handlers indicates a focus on performance optimization.

`DemoDashboard.jsx` (9:24 PM and 9:26 PM) shows similar UI refinements in the final commit compared to its initial commit at 9:24 PM. This component displays a dashboard for managing demo courses, with functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting demo courses and filtering by various criteria. It uses a similar pattern to `CourseDashboard.jsx` for state management (`useDemoCourseStore`),  modals and incorporates loading state indicators. The `fetchCourses` function now accepts the user object as an argument, implying that course fetching is now potentially user-specific.


Recurring elements across the code include:

*   Extensive use of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`)
*   Modal components for creating, editing, and confirming actions
*   Integration with `react-toastify` for displaying notifications
*   Use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`) for API calls
*   Error handling and loading state management


The overall pattern suggests a well-structured React application with a focus on user experience and maintainability.  The changes primarily focused on refining UI elements, improving error handling in the booking flow, and adding user-specific course fetching capabilities in the demo dashboard.
