# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 1:02:09 AM
The `TeacherList.js` file underwent two revisions on June 5th, 2025.  The primary change involves the addition of a `TeacherActionModal` component. This modal, triggered by clicking a teacher card, allows users to either "Book Demo Class" or "Buy Full Course."  The modal displays the selected teacher's name and provides informative descriptions of each action.  A minor style change occurred in the second revision: the background opacity of the modal was adjusted from `bg-black bg-opacity-50` to `bg-black/40`. The `TeacherList` component itself was modified to incorporate the modal;  the `onClick` handler for `TeacherCard` was updated to manage the modal's state and the addition of navigation to a payment route upon course purchase.  The first revision occurred at 12:58:23 AM, and the second, a minor style update, was made one minute later at 12:59:24 AM.  Both revisions maintain the core functionality of displaying a list of teachers and handling the selection of a teacher.

The log shows multiple revisions to `index.html` between 11:58 AM and 12:21 PM on June 5th, 2025.  The main content of the file remained consistent: an HTML page encouraging users to upgrade their Skribe account before their trial ends.  The page features a header with a logo, a main title, a description highlighting key features (Smart Analytics & Reporting, National Media Monitoring, Daily Skribe Clips, Press Release Distribution, and Regional & Vernacular Coverage), an upgrade offer, a call to action for a demo, and a footer with social media links.

The most significant changes involve the image sources. Initially, placeholder images (`via.placeholder.com`) were used.  Between 12:08 PM and 12:17 PM, these were replaced with images from "https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/".  Specifically, the logo, feature icons, and potentially a background image were updated. There were also several instances where the entire HTML code was commented out (`<!-- ... -->`) before the new version was added. This suggests an iterative process of updating the file, possibly due to testing or correcting image URLs. The final version, around 12:21 PM, appears to settle on using the images from `www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`.  There were no other substantial content alterations.
