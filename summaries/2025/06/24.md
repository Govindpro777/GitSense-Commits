# Activity Summary for 6/24/2025

## 10:09:31 AM
The log shows significant changes across several files between 9:23 AM and 9:59 AM on June 24, 2025.  The primary focus was on the development and refinement of a gallery feature.

**`Gallery.js` (9:23:23 AM):** This file defines a Mongoose schema for a `Gallery` model.  The schema includes fields for `orderId`, `order` (a reference to an `Order` model), CAD and image files, metadata (size, mime type), tags, description, and an `isActive` flag for soft deletes.  Crucially, it introduces static and instance methods: `createGalleryEntries` for bulk insertion and `getPairedItem` for retrieving paired CAD and image data.  Compound indexes are defined for efficient querying based on `orderId` and `createdAt`, and `order` and `uploadDate`.


**`graphics.controller.js` (9:35:37 AM & 9:36:30 AM):** This controller initially contained only a placeholder route.  Subsequent updates introduced a substantial `createOrder` function. This function handles order creation, including file uploads via `localFileUpload`, assigning orders to available Graphics users using `findAvailableGraphicsUser` (which leverages aggregation to find users with the least active orders), creating associated work queue items, and sending assignment notifications through `sendAssignmentNotification` using Socket.IO.  The function uses transactions to ensure data consistency.  Helper functions for priority and estimated completion time calculations are also included.  The commented-out code suggests an earlier version of the order creation functionality.  There is a minimal change between the two timestamps recorded for this file.  The changes are minor additions to the `createOrder` function.

**`gallery.controller.js` (9:37:19 AM & 9:37:49 AM):** This controller manages the Gallery API endpoints. It provides functionalities for retrieving all gallery items (`getAllGalleryItems`), retrieving items by order ID (`getGalleryByOrder`), updating items (`updateGalleryItem`), soft deleting items (`archiveGalleryItem`), and fetching gallery statistics (`getGalleryStats`).  The key difference between the two entries is a correction in the import statement, changing `models/gallery.model` to `models/Gallery`.

**`gallery.routes.js` (9:40:05 AM, 9:41:19 AM & 9:48:27 AM):**  This file defines the routes for the gallery.  The early versions had incomplete routes and incorrect controller references. The final version (9:48:27 AM) establishes correct routes for fetching all gallery items, statistics, items by order, updating, and archiving, with appropriate authentication and authorization middleware (`auth`, `isGraphics`, `isSuperAdmin`).

**`index.js` (9:53:58 AM):** This is the main application file. It sets up the Express server, database connection, middleware (including CORS with specific allowed origins, cookie parser, and file upload), and routes. It also initializes Socket.IO for real-time communication, integrating with a `socketManager` for user socket tracking and authentication (`socketAuthenticator`).

**`App.jsx` (9:57:50 AM):** This React component renders the frontend application's main layout.  It includes navigation and routes for various pages, including a new `Gallery2` page.  A sidebar is implemented with conditional rendering based on screen size and user role.  Socket.IO integration is done via a custom `SocketProvider`.

**`Sidebar.jsx` (9:58:17 AM):** This React component renders the sidebar navigation menu, dynamically showing menu items based on the user's role.


**`Gallery2.jsx` (9:58:36 AM):**  This React component implements the frontend for the `Gallery2` page, showing the gallery items. It uses pagination, search, and filtering capabilities, and provides features to preview images, edit item details, and archive items.  It also includes a section to display gallery statistics.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Consistent use of `mongoose` for database interactions.
* Extensive use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`).
* Error handling within `try...catch` blocks.
* Standard RESTful API design patterns in controllers and routes.
* Authentication and authorization middleware (`auth`, `isGraphics`, `isSuperAdmin`).
* Use of Socket.IO for real-time notifications.
* Frontend uses React and Lucide React icons.

The overall pattern suggests a robust and well-structured backend application with a corresponding, feature-rich frontend interface for managing a design gallery system. The changes in `gallery.routes.js` suggest a final push to complete the gallery functionality and make it accessible to different user roles based on authorization.


## 11:08:41 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `SocialSummary.jsx` and `CampaignOutreach.jsx` components between 10:08 AM and 11:03 AM on June 24, 2025.

`SocialSummary.jsx`:  The main changes involve the date input fields.  Initially,  text inputs were used with placeholder dates ("Jun 20, 2025", "Jul 20, 2025"). These were then replaced with  `type="date"` inputs, removing the placeholder and simplifying the date selection.  Around 10:24 AM, additional styling was added to the date inputs (`className="custom-date"` and later removed). Finally, the calendar icons next to the date inputs were removed at around 10:28 AM. The `max-w` property on the start date input was added at 10:34 AM.


`CampaignOutreach.jsx`: The primary modification in this file involved restructuring the layout of the attachment preview section around 10:31 AM. The `ul` element containing attachment previews was moved to be next to the file upload label, improving the visual organization. No functional changes to the component's logic seem to have occurred.


There is a recurring pattern in `SocialSummary.jsx` edits focusing on refinements to date input components.  The majority of the edits are minor stylistic adjustments and refactoring of the date handling, with no major functional alterations. The `CampaignOutreach.jsx` component saw a single, significant restructuring of the UI.


## 1:08:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components within a Next.js application, primarily focused on the email preview and campaign outreach features.  The majority of changes occur between 12:19 PM and 12:56 PM on June 24, 2025.


`CampaignOutreach.jsx`: This component is a form for creating campaign outreach.  Early revisions show a commented-out import section suggesting some dependencies were initially considered but subsequently removed or handled differently. The component handles user input for campaign deliverables (content type, duration, quantity), campaign brief (using ReactQuill), and file uploads (with validation for type and size).  Later revisions do not show any changes to this component's functionality.


`EmailPreview.jsx`: This component displays a preview of the generated email.  Significant changes are made between 12:19 PM and 12:56 PM.  Initially, the email content was hardcoded.  Later revisions introduce a `generateEmailContent` function that dynamically builds the email content based on `campaignBrief` and `deliverables` data passed from `CampaignOutreach.jsx`. The function removes HTML tags from the campaign brief to ensure plain text in the email, and it also formats the deliverables into a table. An `onRemoveAttachment` prop was added to allow for the removal of attachments.


`EditableTable.jsx`: This component is responsible for rendering the email content, specifically formatting tables, bold text, bullet points and italic text from the email body string within the `EmailPreview` component. Early revisions show a simple table rendering.  Later revisions (around 12:24 PM and later) add support for italic text (using single asterisks) and refine the table styling using a `<div>` to wrap the table which helps styling of this table.  The `Category` header in table handling logic is made more robust to handle both `Category` and `Content` header variations.



A recurring pattern is the use of functional components with useState and useEffect hooks in React, and the consistent use of inline styling with Tailwind CSS classes for UI elements.  The components heavily rely on props for data passing between them, suggesting a well-structured component architecture.


## 2:08:40 PM
The code changes primarily focus on two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EditableTable.jsx`.  The modifications span a period from 1:08 PM to 2:08 PM on June 24th, 2025.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent extensive revisions.  Early versions contained a hardcoded email template.  Later versions (starting around 1:09 PM) dynamically generate the email content based on `campaignBrief` and `deliverables` props.  The  `generateEmailContent` function handles this dynamic generation, stripping HTML tags from the brief and conditionally including a deliverables table. A significant change around 1:20 PM simplifies the email content when in edit mode (`isEditing` state is true), omitting the deliverables table.  Further refinements around 1:33 PM to 1:54 PM improved the  `generateEmailContent` function's logic to clearly separate base content from the conditionally added deliverables table, and ensured email content updates when `campaignBrief` or `deliverables` change. Finally, the attachment removal functionality was enhanced  (around 1:10 PM and later) to handle different attachment types (local images vs. images stored in a store).

`EditableTable.jsx`  shows modifications in its `formatEmailContent` function. The initial version (1:09 PM) rendered the email content as a table only if it detected the "Category" header.  Subsequent updates (1:24 PM and 1:36 PM) expanded this to also recognize "Content" as a header, enhancing table creation flexibility.  The component consistently uses a table structure for rendering data and includes formatting for bold, italic and bullet points within the email.


The overall pattern in the changes is a movement towards a more robust and flexible email preview component that adapts to varying input data.  The modifications also indicate a focus on improving the user experience by separating concerns for better code readability and maintainability.


## 3:08:44 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EditableTable.jsx`, primarily focusing on email preview functionality and its content rendering.

`EmailPreview.jsx`:  The file underwent extensive changes between 2:09:02 PM and 2:46:52 PM.  Initially, the email content was hardcoded.  Subsequent revisions introduced dynamic email content generation based on `campaignBrief` and `deliverables` props.  The email content now dynamically incorporates a deliverables table if deliverables are provided and removes HTML tags from the campaign brief for a plain-text preview.  A significant change involves the addition of an `onRemoveAttachment` prop and the handling of attachment removal, indicating improved management of attached images. The UI also improved with better attachment display and  a toggle between an editable textarea and a formatted preview of the email content.

`EditableTable.jsx`: This file was modified between 2:25:40 PM and 2:32:54 PM, then again at 2:32:54 PM. The initial version rendered a simple table from the provided email content. The most significant revision at 2:32:54 PM reverted the file to a simpler version of the component, suggesting a potential strategy change or a temporary rollback.  A later commit at 2:32:54 PM introduced an `isEditable` prop, enabling content editing with a `contentEditable` div.  This adds dynamic functionality to the table, allowing for on-the-fly changes to email content that are directly reflected in the `EmailPreview` component.  Finally, a minor change was made at 2:30:27 PM, which added `isEditable` and `onContentChange` props to enable dynamic updating of the table.


There is a clear pattern of iterative development, with multiple small changes made to `EmailPreview.jsx` in rapid succession to refine its email generation and UI. The changes to `EditableTable.jsx` are directly related to enhancing the functionality of the `EmailPreview` component, emphasizing a close relationship and coordinated development between the two files.  The use of functional components and React state management (`useState`, `useEffect`) is consistent throughout the code changes.


## 4:08:39 PM
The log shows a series of edits to two files within a React-based project (`Skribe-Frontend`).  The most significant changes are in `EmailPreview.jsx`, spanning multiple revisions between 3:16 PM and 4:07 PM.  These revisions reflect a refactoring effort to improve the component's structure and functionality.

Initially, `EmailPreview.jsx` contained a largely commented-out component,  suggesting a significant rewrite was underway. The commented-out code generated an email preview based on campaign details and deliverables, including a table.  Later revisions introduce a new approach using  `useState` to manage separate editable content sections (greeting, introduction, etc.)  instead of a single `emailContent` string. The `generateEmailContent` function is modified throughout to reflect this change, ultimately assembling the email from these separate editable sections. A `generateDeliverableTable` function is also added to manage the creation of a deliverables table. The final version at 4:07 PM shows a well-structured component using separate states for different parts of the email content, making it more maintainable and allowing granular editing.

The `CampaignOutreach.jsx` file was edited twice, with minor changes between 3:11 PM and 3:12 PM. This single component's update involved the addition of file upload functionality. The component now allows users to upload multiple files (jpg, jpeg, png, pdf) with a 5MB size limit, providing visual previews and the ability to delete uploaded files.  Error handling via `useNotification` is included to inform the user about file type or size restrictions.  The file upload logic is encapsulated in the `FileUpload` function and file deletion in `handleDelete` and `handleRemoveAttachment`.
