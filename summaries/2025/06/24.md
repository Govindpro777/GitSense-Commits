# Activity Summary for 6/24/2025

## 10:09:31 AM
The log shows significant changes across several files between 9:23 AM and 9:59 AM on June 24, 2025.  The primary focus was on the development and refinement of a gallery feature.

**`Gallery.js` (9:23:23 AM):** This file defines a Mongoose schema for a `Gallery` model.  The schema includes fields for `orderId`, `order` (a reference to an `Order` model), CAD and image files, metadata (size, mime type), tags, description, and an `isActive` flag for soft deletes.  Crucially, it introduces static and instance methods: `createGalleryEntries` for bulk insertion and `getPairedItem` for retrieving paired CAD and image data.  Compound indexes are defined for efficient querying based on `orderId` and `createdAt`, and `order` and `uploadDate`.


**`graphics.controller.js` (9:35:37 AM & 9:36:30 AM):** This controller initially contained only a placeholder route.  Subsequent updates introduced a substantial `createOrder` function. This function handles order creation, including file uploads via `localFileUpload`, assigning orders to available Graphics users using `findAvailableGraphicsUser` (which leverages aggregation to find users with the least active orders), creating associated work queue items, and sending assignment notifications through `sendAssignmentNotification` using Socket.IO.  The function uses transactions to ensure data consistency.  Helper functions for priority and estimated completion time calculations are also included.  The commented-out code suggests an earlier version of the order creation functionality.  There is a minimal change between the two timestamps recorded for this file.  The changes are minor additions to the `createOrder` function.

**`gallery.controller.js` (9:37:19 AM & 9:37:49 AM):** This controller manages the Gallery API endpoints. It provides functionalities for retrieving all gallery items (`getAllGalleryItems`), retrieving items by order ID (`getGalleryByOrder`), updating items (`updateGalleryItem`), soft deleting items (`archiveGalleryItem`), and fetching gallery statistics (`getGalleryStats`).  The key difference between the two entries is a correction in the import statement, changing `models/gallery.model` to `models/Gallery`.

**`gallery.routes.js` (9:40:05 AM, 9:41:19 AM & 9:48:27 AM):**  This file defines the routes for the gallery.  The early versions had incomplete routes and incorrect controller references. The final version (9:48:27 AM) establishes correct routes for fetching all gallery items, statistics, items by order, updating, and archiving, with appropriate authentication and authorization middleware (`auth`, `isGraphics`, `isSuperAdmin`).

**`index.js` (9:53:58 AM):** This is the main application file. It sets up the Express server, database connection, middleware (including CORS with specific allowed origins, cookie parser, and file upload), and routes. It also initializes Socket.IO for real-time communication, integrating with a `socketManager` for user socket tracking and authentication (`socketAuthenticator`).

**`App.jsx` (9:57:50 AM):** This React component renders the frontend application's main layout.  It includes navigation and routes for various pages, including a new `Gallery2` page.  A sidebar is implemented with conditional rendering based on screen size and user role.  Socket.IO integration is done via a custom `SocketProvider`.

**`Sidebar.jsx` (9:58:17 AM):** This React component renders the sidebar navigation menu, dynamically showing menu items based on the user's role.


**`Gallery2.jsx` (9:58:36 AM):**  This React component implements the frontend for the `Gallery2` page, showing the gallery items. It uses pagination, search, and filtering capabilities, and provides features to preview images, edit item details, and archive items.  It also includes a section to display gallery statistics.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Consistent use of `mongoose` for database interactions.
* Extensive use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`).
* Error handling within `try...catch` blocks.
* Standard RESTful API design patterns in controllers and routes.
* Authentication and authorization middleware (`auth`, `isGraphics`, `isSuperAdmin`).
* Use of Socket.IO for real-time notifications.
* Frontend uses React and Lucide React icons.

The overall pattern suggests a robust and well-structured backend application with a corresponding, feature-rich frontend interface for managing a design gallery system. The changes in `gallery.routes.js` suggest a final push to complete the gallery functionality and make it accessible to different user roles based on authorization.
