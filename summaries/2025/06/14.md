# Activity Summary for 6/14/2025

## 12:08:47 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to two files within the `Skribe-Backend` project, specifically `TimeLine.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`.  Both files utilize React and ApexCharts for data visualization.

**`BrandSummary.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):**  This component displays a brand summary report.  The majority of changes between 11:32:51 PM and 11:40:33 PM involve refinements to the styling and layout of the charts and data display within the component.  There are multiple bar charts and donut charts visualizing data such as top publications, quality of mentions, and regional split of mentions. A ReactSpeedometer component shows the sentiment score.  The code consistently uses dummy data (in `dummyData`) as a fallback when API data (`data`) isn't available.   Notable changes include adjustments to chart heights, font sizes, color palettes, and the addition of a legend and data labels to the charts.  The commented-out `<ReactSpeedometer>` component suggests iterative experimentation with different configurations.  The final revision at 11:40:33 PM includes a complete implementation of a `ReactSpeedometer` with customized styling and color schemes and shows the sentiment breakdown for the score.

**`TimeLine.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This file underwent significant changes, evolving from an area chart to a line chart. Initial revisions (11:25:56 PM) show an area chart visualization with multiple series. The commented-out code suggests the chart was initially larger and gradually reduced in height and font sizes for a more compact layout. At 11:46:36 PM, the area chart was completely replaced. The 11:47:50 PM revision attempts to implement a line chart with smooth curves and markers.  The final iterations, starting 11:49:16 PM and continuing to 11:54:31 PM, involve styling the legend markers, first making them square and then adding custom HTML to give the legend markers a uniform visual representation.  The x-axis categories are not appropriately set to dates in the initial revisions of the line chart and are corrected to reflect dates only at the final stage. The final implementation uses `ReactApexChart` to create a line chart that summarizes narratives over time.


The overall pattern in the code modifications points to a focus on improving the visual presentation and usability of the brand summary report. The modifications to the Timeline chart reflect iterative design changes, experimenting with different chart types (area vs. line) before settling on a final version.  The consistent use of dummy data indicates a robust error-handling approach.
