# Activity Summary for 6/14/2025

## 12:08:47 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to two files within the `Skribe-Backend` project, specifically `TimeLine.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`.  Both files utilize React and ApexCharts for data visualization.

**`BrandSummary.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):**  This component displays a brand summary report.  The majority of changes between 11:32:51 PM and 11:40:33 PM involve refinements to the styling and layout of the charts and data display within the component.  There are multiple bar charts and donut charts visualizing data such as top publications, quality of mentions, and regional split of mentions. A ReactSpeedometer component shows the sentiment score.  The code consistently uses dummy data (in `dummyData`) as a fallback when API data (`data`) isn't available.   Notable changes include adjustments to chart heights, font sizes, color palettes, and the addition of a legend and data labels to the charts.  The commented-out `<ReactSpeedometer>` component suggests iterative experimentation with different configurations.  The final revision at 11:40:33 PM includes a complete implementation of a `ReactSpeedometer` with customized styling and color schemes and shows the sentiment breakdown for the score.

**`TimeLine.tsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This file underwent significant changes, evolving from an area chart to a line chart. Initial revisions (11:25:56 PM) show an area chart visualization with multiple series. The commented-out code suggests the chart was initially larger and gradually reduced in height and font sizes for a more compact layout. At 11:46:36 PM, the area chart was completely replaced. The 11:47:50 PM revision attempts to implement a line chart with smooth curves and markers.  The final iterations, starting 11:49:16 PM and continuing to 11:54:31 PM, involve styling the legend markers, first making them square and then adding custom HTML to give the legend markers a uniform visual representation.  The x-axis categories are not appropriately set to dates in the initial revisions of the line chart and are corrected to reflect dates only at the final stage. The final implementation uses `ReactApexChart` to create a line chart that summarizes narratives over time.


The overall pattern in the code modifications points to a focus on improving the visual presentation and usability of the brand summary report. The modifications to the Timeline chart reflect iterative design changes, experimenting with different chart types (area vs. line) before settling on a final version.  The consistent use of dummy data indicates a robust error-handling approach.


## 1:08:46 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `TimeLine.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx` components between 12:09 AM and 1:07 AM on June 14, 2025.  The `TimeLine.tsx` component, initially an area chart, was changed to a line chart.  Several revisions focused on styling the chart, including adjustments to colors, marker size, axis labels, grid lines, and font sizes within the chart's container.  The x-axis labels ('Dates of Narratives') remained consistent, but the y-axis labels ('Mentions') were initially shown and later hidden for a cleaner look. The line width was also reduced from 3 to 2.  The grid lines were changed from solid to dashed and the color was altered from dark grey to light grey. The axis colors were also changed to black from a lighter grey color.


The `BrandSummary.tsx` component underwent changes primarily focused on styling and minor functional adjustments.  It uses `ReactApexChart` for bar and donut charts, and `ReactSpeedometer` for displaying a sentiment score.  The updates involved modifying font sizes, colors, border styles, and the overall layout of the chart containers.  A notable change was the addition of `min: 0` to the `yaxis` options of the bar chart to ensure the bars always start from zero.  The labels for the y axis were conditionally hidden when 0 was passed in.  The grid lines on the bar chart were also modified.  The overall effect is improved visual presentation and enhanced readability.  The changes to `BrandSummary.tsx` involved improving the styling and making slight functional changes.  The primary change was to the y axis which now starts from 0 and hides the 0 label itself.  The grid lines were also modified.


## 10:37:53 AM
The log shows two revisions of `Sidebar.jsx` within a minute of each other (9:49:41 AM and 9:50:06 AM on June 14, 2025).  The only difference between the revisions is a change in the `menuItems` object for the `SuperAdmin` role. Specifically,  an item with the name "Gall" and path "/image-search" was renamed to "Gallery" and path "/gallery".  The rest of the component's code, including its functionality (handling menu item selection, logout, and responsiveness), remains unchanged.  The component uses React Router for navigation, Lucide React for icons, and React Hot Toast for notifications.  It dynamically renders menu items based on the user's role stored in localStorage.


## 11:37:57 AM
The log shows several revisions to two React component files: `ImageSearch.jsx` and `Gallery.jsx`.  The changes primarily involve fetching and displaying images, implementing image search functionality, and refining UI elements.

`ImageSearch.jsx` (6/14/2025, 10:42:44 AM): This file implements an image search feature. It allows users to upload an image, searches for similar images using a specified API (`import.meta.env.VITE_FAST_API` or a fallback URL), and displays the results. The code includes image upload validation (type and size), error handling, loading indicators, and different view modes (grid and list).  The search results are filtered by minimum similarity and sorted by similarity or name.  Image download and viewing functionalities are also provided.

`Gallery.jsx`: This file underwent multiple revisions (6/14/2025, 10:45:59 AM, 10:54:42 AM, 10:56:45 AM, 11:00:38 AM, 11:14:36 AM). Initially, it contained placeholder hardcoded gallery data. Subsequent revisions fetch order data and associated image files from an API (using `localStorage.getItem("token")` for authentication), display them in a grid or list view, add filtering by order status, sorting options (by creation date, order ID, or customer name), pagination, and error handling.  Crucially, the 11:00:38 AM revision switched the API configuration to use environment variables via `import.meta.env`, suggesting a migration to a Vite-based build system.  The later revisions appear to be incomplete or commented-out versions of the code,  showing iterative development.  The final version (11:00:38 AM) includes a section for displaying image search results alongside the gallery.  It also integrates an image search feature which uses the same API endpoint as `ImageSearch.jsx` (with an environment variable fallback).

A recurring pattern across both components is the extensive use of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) and the Lucide React icon library for UI elements. Both also handle API calls, display error messages, and implement loading states.  The consistent use of error handling demonstrates a focus on application robustness.  The API endpoints used suggest a backend server responsible for image storage and retrieval.  The evolution of `Gallery.jsx` from a static component to one fetching dynamic data from an API demonstrates a significant shift in functionality.


## 12:37:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Gallery.jsx` file between 11:44 AM and 12:26 PM on June 14, 2025.  All revisions contain the same commented-out React component code for displaying a gallery of order images. The code fetches order data and associated image files from an API (`BASE_URL/api/v1/admin/getOrders` and  `BASE_URL/api/v1/admin/files/order/{order._id}`).  It filters for orders containing CAD files, and includes image search functionality using a separate API (`IMAGE_SEARCH_API/search`).  The `BASE_URL` and `IMAGE_SEARCH_API` are dynamically determined using environment variables, suggesting a build process using Vite.  No substantive code changes are observed across the different timestamps.  The multiple entries likely represent different stages in the development workflow, possibly related to saving and reverting.


## 1:38:08 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend\src\pages\Gallery.jsx` between 12:41 PM and 12:51 PM on June 14, 2025.  The code within the file is a React component that displays a gallery of images associated with orders.  The component fetches order data and associated image files from an API (`BASE_URL/api/v1/admin/getOrders` and `BASE_URL/api/v1/admin/files/order/{order._id}`).  It only includes orders with CAD files and provides features for filtering by order status, sorting by creation date, order ID, or customer name, and pagination.  There's also an image search function that uses a separate API (`IMAGE_SEARCH_API/search`) to find similar images.  The code remains largely unchanged across all updates in the log; the timestamps indicate iterative modifications, potentially debugging or minor adjustments to the component, rather than substantial structural changes.  The repeated code suggests no major functional changes were implemented during this period.
