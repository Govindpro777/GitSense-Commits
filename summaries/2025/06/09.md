# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 10:47:27 AM
The file `Rating.js` underwent changes between 10:35:33 AM and 10:36:58 AM on June 9, 2025.  The primary modification involved the `CommentCard` component.  Specifically, the `DOMPurify.sanitize()` function call was removed from the `cleanText` function within the `CommentCard` component. This suggests a change in how review text is handled, potentially removing a sanitization step.  No other significant functional changes are apparent in the provided diffs; the code remains largely the same, focusing on rendering star ratings, fetching reviews via `axiosInstance`, and displaying them using various React components.  Skeleton components for loading states are also present. The code uses several external libraries including `react-icons`, `lucide-react`, `axios`, `js-cookie`, `next/image`, `react-spinners`, and `@mantine/core`.


## 11:11:11 AM
The log shows changes to two files within a Learning Management System (LMS).

First,  `courseModel.js` (6/9/2025, 11:02:43 AM) was updated.  This file, a Mongoose schema for courses, underwent a significant revision. The update focused on handling course deletion.  Initially, there was a commented-out `pre('remove')` hook for cascading session deletion.  This was replaced with a `pre('deleteOne')` hook that more effectively handles the deletion of associated sessions and classes before deleting the course.  The schema itself defines course attributes such as name, details (modules, description, thumbnail), duration, mode, price, teachers, batch, enrollment, student range, and status.

Second, `Course.jsx` (6/9/2025, 11:10:26 AM and 6/9/2025, 11:10:41 AM) was updated twice within a short time frame.  These updates likely involved minor revisions or corrections, as the code content is almost identical in both timestamps. This React component renders a course page, including sections for the header, navigation, overview, curriculum, instructor, reviews, sidebar, and related courses. The curriculum displays a detailed lesson plan with modules and lessons, each with a title and duration, and a preview flag.  The component uses state variables to manage which modules are expanded and whether to show all modules or just a subset.  Sample student reviews are also included.  No substantial changes are apparent between the two commits to this file.


## 12:17:17 PM
The code log shows development on a React-based press release distribution platform.  Several components are updated throughout the log, primarily focusing on UI enhancements and adding functionality.

The `DistributionPackages.js` component undergoes several revisions.  Initially (11:29:30 AM), it displays a list of press release distribution packages with options for selection.  A significant change occurs at 11:50:25 AM where the default selection is removed, requiring users to actively select packages. A "Go to Next Step" button is disabled until at least one package is selected.  Earlier versions (11:45:29 AM) were fully commented out.  The component consistently uses a similar structure for displaying packages, with a consistent styling pattern throughout.

`DistributionUpgrades.js` is also refactored multiple times. The component, which allows users to add optional upgrades, starts with a fully commented-out version at (11:48:44 AM), and then has several iterations leading to a final working version at (12:02:57 PM). The initial versions included a popup for quote requests, while the final version removes default checked options and adds a "Go Back" button.  The final version disables the "Request a Quote" button until an option is selected.


The `BrandStory.js` component is updated at 11:50:48 AM and 11:53:20 AM, with minor changes to styling and the removal of unnecessary elements. The final functional version appears at 12:02:05 PM adding a "Go Back" button.  There is a consistent use of color schemes and styling throughout.

Finally, `TopJournalist.jsx` (12:14:16 PM) displays a table of top journalists, allowing users to add them to a CRM. The component uses the `userService` to fetch data and integrates a notification system.  It includes functionality to select journalists, add them to a CRM (with a limit of 5), and build a campaign.


The overall pattern across all the changes is the iterative refinement of UI components.  There's a consistent movement towards improved user experience with added error handling and clear feedback mechanisms (disabled buttons when selections are not made). The frequent commenting out and uncommenting suggests an experimental approach to development and testing different features and layouts.  The use of `useNavigate` in multiple components suggests a consistent routing strategy.


## 1:17:18 PM
The log shows several code modifications across two React components: `DistributionPackages.js` and `DistributionUpgrades.js`, both located within a press release feature of a frontend application.  The updates primarily focus on UI enhancements and adding error handling and validation.

**`DistributionPackages.js` Updates:**

* **Significant Change (12:47:13 PM):** This commit is the most substantial.  It introduces a validation mechanism (`showWarning`) using a custom notification system (`useNotification`) to prevent navigation to the next step (`/brand-story/explore/next`) if no package is selected.  The component now imports `useNotification` and uses it for showing warnings. A "Go to Next Step" button replaces the previous navigation.

* **Earlier Changes (12:18:35 PM and 12:22:06 PM):** These commits appear to represent earlier stages of development, with the initial code showcasing the structure and layout for displaying different distribution packages (top-tier and standard) with selection capabilities.  The code is primarily a large JSX structure for displaying various packages with selection checkboxes.


**`DistributionUpgrades.js` Updates:**

* **Significant Change (12:36:37 PM - 12:47:30 PM):** Multiple commits during this period refined the error handling.  The initial versions lacked feedback if the user tried to request a quote without selecting any upgrade options. The final version (12:47:30 PM) integrates the `useNotification` hook to display a warning message in such cases, improving user experience. This change also simplifies the "Request a Quote" button's conditional rendering.  The component now also imports `useNotification`.

* **Earlier Changes (12:24:58 PM):** This initial commit sets up the basic structure of the component, allowing users to select optional website postings via checkboxes.  It includes a simple confirmation popup after a request, showing a success message.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* **Consistent Use of Styling:** Both components heavily utilize inline styling (within the JSX) and demonstrate a consistent approach to styling elements.

* **Navigation Handling:** Both components use `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom` for navigation, specifically implementing a "Go Back" button.

* **Notification System:** Both components incorporate a shared custom notification system (`useNotification`) for displaying warnings, illustrating a cohesive approach to error handling across multiple components.

The overall changes reveal a focus on improving user experience by adding clear warnings and improving error handling within the press release featureâ€™s distribution selection and upgrade processes.  The code shows a progression from a basic UI implementation to a more polished version with improved feedback mechanisms.
