# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 10:47:27 AM
The file `Rating.js` underwent changes between 10:35:33 AM and 10:36:58 AM on June 9, 2025.  The primary modification involved the `CommentCard` component.  Specifically, the `DOMPurify.sanitize()` function call was removed from the `cleanText` function within the `CommentCard` component. This suggests a change in how review text is handled, potentially removing a sanitization step.  No other significant functional changes are apparent in the provided diffs; the code remains largely the same, focusing on rendering star ratings, fetching reviews via `axiosInstance`, and displaying them using various React components.  Skeleton components for loading states are also present. The code uses several external libraries including `react-icons`, `lucide-react`, `axios`, `js-cookie`, `next/image`, `react-spinners`, and `@mantine/core`.


## 11:11:11 AM
The log shows changes to two files within a Learning Management System (LMS).

First,  `courseModel.js` (6/9/2025, 11:02:43 AM) was updated.  This file, a Mongoose schema for courses, underwent a significant revision. The update focused on handling course deletion.  Initially, there was a commented-out `pre('remove')` hook for cascading session deletion.  This was replaced with a `pre('deleteOne')` hook that more effectively handles the deletion of associated sessions and classes before deleting the course.  The schema itself defines course attributes such as name, details (modules, description, thumbnail), duration, mode, price, teachers, batch, enrollment, student range, and status.

Second, `Course.jsx` (6/9/2025, 11:10:26 AM and 6/9/2025, 11:10:41 AM) was updated twice within a short time frame.  These updates likely involved minor revisions or corrections, as the code content is almost identical in both timestamps. This React component renders a course page, including sections for the header, navigation, overview, curriculum, instructor, reviews, sidebar, and related courses. The curriculum displays a detailed lesson plan with modules and lessons, each with a title and duration, and a preview flag.  The component uses state variables to manage which modules are expanded and whether to show all modules or just a subset.  Sample student reviews are also included.  No substantial changes are apparent between the two commits to this file.
