# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 10:47:27 AM
The file `Rating.js` underwent changes between 10:35:33 AM and 10:36:58 AM on June 9, 2025.  The primary modification involved the `CommentCard` component.  Specifically, the `DOMPurify.sanitize()` function call was removed from the `cleanText` function within the `CommentCard` component. This suggests a change in how review text is handled, potentially removing a sanitization step.  No other significant functional changes are apparent in the provided diffs; the code remains largely the same, focusing on rendering star ratings, fetching reviews via `axiosInstance`, and displaying them using various React components.  Skeleton components for loading states are also present. The code uses several external libraries including `react-icons`, `lucide-react`, `axios`, `js-cookie`, `next/image`, `react-spinners`, and `@mantine/core`.
