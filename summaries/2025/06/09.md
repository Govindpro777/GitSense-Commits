# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 10:47:27 AM
The file `Rating.js` underwent changes between 10:35:33 AM and 10:36:58 AM on June 9, 2025.  The primary modification involved the `CommentCard` component.  Specifically, the `DOMPurify.sanitize()` function call was removed from the `cleanText` function within the `CommentCard` component. This suggests a change in how review text is handled, potentially removing a sanitization step.  No other significant functional changes are apparent in the provided diffs; the code remains largely the same, focusing on rendering star ratings, fetching reviews via `axiosInstance`, and displaying them using various React components.  Skeleton components for loading states are also present. The code uses several external libraries including `react-icons`, `lucide-react`, `axios`, `js-cookie`, `next/image`, `react-spinners`, and `@mantine/core`.


## 11:11:11 AM
The log shows changes to two files within a Learning Management System (LMS).

First,  `courseModel.js` (6/9/2025, 11:02:43 AM) was updated.  This file, a Mongoose schema for courses, underwent a significant revision. The update focused on handling course deletion.  Initially, there was a commented-out `pre('remove')` hook for cascading session deletion.  This was replaced with a `pre('deleteOne')` hook that more effectively handles the deletion of associated sessions and classes before deleting the course.  The schema itself defines course attributes such as name, details (modules, description, thumbnail), duration, mode, price, teachers, batch, enrollment, student range, and status.

Second, `Course.jsx` (6/9/2025, 11:10:26 AM and 6/9/2025, 11:10:41 AM) was updated twice within a short time frame.  These updates likely involved minor revisions or corrections, as the code content is almost identical in both timestamps. This React component renders a course page, including sections for the header, navigation, overview, curriculum, instructor, reviews, sidebar, and related courses. The curriculum displays a detailed lesson plan with modules and lessons, each with a title and duration, and a preview flag.  The component uses state variables to manage which modules are expanded and whether to show all modules or just a subset.  Sample student reviews are also included.  No substantial changes are apparent between the two commits to this file.


## 12:17:17 PM
The code log shows development on a React-based press release distribution platform.  Several components are updated throughout the log, primarily focusing on UI enhancements and adding functionality.

The `DistributionPackages.js` component undergoes several revisions.  Initially (11:29:30 AM), it displays a list of press release distribution packages with options for selection.  A significant change occurs at 11:50:25 AM where the default selection is removed, requiring users to actively select packages. A "Go to Next Step" button is disabled until at least one package is selected.  Earlier versions (11:45:29 AM) were fully commented out.  The component consistently uses a similar structure for displaying packages, with a consistent styling pattern throughout.

`DistributionUpgrades.js` is also refactored multiple times. The component, which allows users to add optional upgrades, starts with a fully commented-out version at (11:48:44 AM), and then has several iterations leading to a final working version at (12:02:57 PM). The initial versions included a popup for quote requests, while the final version removes default checked options and adds a "Go Back" button.  The final version disables the "Request a Quote" button until an option is selected.


The `BrandStory.js` component is updated at 11:50:48 AM and 11:53:20 AM, with minor changes to styling and the removal of unnecessary elements. The final functional version appears at 12:02:05 PM adding a "Go Back" button.  There is a consistent use of color schemes and styling throughout.

Finally, `TopJournalist.jsx` (12:14:16 PM) displays a table of top journalists, allowing users to add them to a CRM. The component uses the `userService` to fetch data and integrates a notification system.  It includes functionality to select journalists, add them to a CRM (with a limit of 5), and build a campaign.


The overall pattern across all the changes is the iterative refinement of UI components.  There's a consistent movement towards improved user experience with added error handling and clear feedback mechanisms (disabled buttons when selections are not made). The frequent commenting out and uncommenting suggests an experimental approach to development and testing different features and layouts.  The use of `useNavigate` in multiple components suggests a consistent routing strategy.


## 1:17:18 PM
The log shows several code modifications across two React components: `DistributionPackages.js` and `DistributionUpgrades.js`, both located within a press release feature of a frontend application.  The updates primarily focus on UI enhancements and adding error handling and validation.

**`DistributionPackages.js` Updates:**

* **Significant Change (12:47:13 PM):** This commit is the most substantial.  It introduces a validation mechanism (`showWarning`) using a custom notification system (`useNotification`) to prevent navigation to the next step (`/brand-story/explore/next`) if no package is selected.  The component now imports `useNotification` and uses it for showing warnings. A "Go to Next Step" button replaces the previous navigation.

* **Earlier Changes (12:18:35 PM and 12:22:06 PM):** These commits appear to represent earlier stages of development, with the initial code showcasing the structure and layout for displaying different distribution packages (top-tier and standard) with selection capabilities.  The code is primarily a large JSX structure for displaying various packages with selection checkboxes.


**`DistributionUpgrades.js` Updates:**

* **Significant Change (12:36:37 PM - 12:47:30 PM):** Multiple commits during this period refined the error handling.  The initial versions lacked feedback if the user tried to request a quote without selecting any upgrade options. The final version (12:47:30 PM) integrates the `useNotification` hook to display a warning message in such cases, improving user experience. This change also simplifies the "Request a Quote" button's conditional rendering.  The component now also imports `useNotification`.

* **Earlier Changes (12:24:58 PM):** This initial commit sets up the basic structure of the component, allowing users to select optional website postings via checkboxes.  It includes a simple confirmation popup after a request, showing a success message.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* **Consistent Use of Styling:** Both components heavily utilize inline styling (within the JSX) and demonstrate a consistent approach to styling elements.

* **Navigation Handling:** Both components use `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom` for navigation, specifically implementing a "Go Back" button.

* **Notification System:** Both components incorporate a shared custom notification system (`useNotification`) for displaying warnings, illustrating a cohesive approach to error handling across multiple components.

The overall changes reveal a focus on improving user experience by adding clear warnings and improving error handling within the press release featureâ€™s distribution selection and upgrade processes.  The code shows a progression from a basic UI implementation to a more polished version with improved feedback mechanisms.


## 2:40:33 PM
The codebase underwent several revisions on June 9th, 2025, primarily focusing on components related to press release distribution: `DistributionUpgrades.js`, `DistributionPackages.js`, and `BrandStory.js`.  The updates consistently involved adding local storage functionality to persist user selections across page navigations.  This is evident in the added `useEffect` hooks that retrieve and set state variables like `selectedPackages`, `selectedDistribution`, and `selectedUpgrades` from `localStorage`. Error handling was also improved with `try...catch` blocks around JSON parsing from localStorage to prevent crashes due to corrupt data.

`DistributionUpgrades.js` was updated to allow users to select optional website postings, storing these selections in `localStorage` under the key 'distributionUpgrades'.  A popup modal confirming quote requests was enhanced with an auto-hide feature after 5 seconds, and navigation to the dashboard is triggered after popup closure.

`DistributionPackages.js` received the most significant changes, introducing the ability for users to select from a range of distribution packages ("Popular Distribution", "Premium Distribution", etc.).  These selections are also persisted in `localStorage` (keys: `selectedPackages`, `selectedDistribution`).  A clear separation of top-tier and standard packages is maintained. The final version added the "Go to Next Step" button and improved UI presentation of selected packages.

`BrandStory.js` was modified to allow users to choose between "Transparent Distribution" (with disclaimer) and "Organic Look Distribution" (without disclaimer).  The selection is saved to `localStorage` as a JSON object under the 'brandStorySelection' key, containing the distribution type, heading, and description.  A more robust data structure ensures data integrity between views.  The changes reflect a shift from simple navigation to a more structured data flow management leveraging `localStorage`.


## 3:40:33 PM
The log shows multiple edits to two React component files: `DistributionPackages.js` and `DistributionUpgrades.js`.  Both files underwent several revisions throughout the afternoon of June 9th, 2025.

`DistributionPackages.js`: This file manages the selection of press release distribution packages.  The initial version (2:50:57 PM)  contained a component rendering various packages (categorized as "Top tier" and "Standard"), allowing users to select them.  A `showWarning` function ensures at least one package is chosen before proceeding. The later version (3:09:35 PM) appears to be largely unchanged structurally; the core functionality remains the same, suggesting minor edits or formatting changes in the intermediate revisions.

`DistributionUpgrades.js`: This file deals with optional distribution upgrades.  The initial versions (2:59:30 PM and 3:03:59 PM)  display a set of checkboxes for selecting website upgrades. A popup appears upon quote request and automatically closes after five seconds.  Significant changes occurred later (between 3:16:00 PM and 3:38:02 PM).  These edits introduced a critical enhancement:  the component now loads previously selected upgrades from `localStorage` on mount.  Furthermore, after the popup closes, the user is now redirected to the `/dashboard` route instead of simply closing the popup. The error handling for parsing saved upgrades from localStorage has also been improved to check if the parsed data is an array. This suggests a focus on improving user experience and persisting user selections across sessions.

A recurring pattern in both files is the use of a custom `useNotification` hook for displaying warnings and messages, along with consistent use of styled components (React's JSX) which suggests a common design system for the application.  The structure of both components shows a similar pattern for navigation (using `useNavigate` hook and a "Go Back" button).


## 4:40:33 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `DistributionPackages.js` and `DistributionUpgrades.js`.  There were no changes to the content of either file between the first and second timestamps for each file.

`DistributionPackages.js` remained unchanged throughout the log entries. It renders a UI for selecting press release distribution packages, categorized into "Top tier" and "Standard" options.  Each package has an ID, title, description (for single packages) or details (for multiple packages), and a type ('single' or 'multi'). The UI includes selection checkboxes, a "Go Back" button, and a "Next Step" button that prevents progression if no package is selected.

`DistributionUpgrades.js` underwent several modifications. The most significant change was the addition of `useEffect` hooks at timestamp 6/9/2025, 3:51:51 PM and subsequent updates.  These hooks manage the persistence of selected upgrade options using `localStorage`, and updates to handle the navigation to the dashboard page after a quote request. Initially, the popup only closed after 5 seconds; this was changed so that the user is redirected to the dashboard after 5 seconds.  The component lets users select optional website upgrades via checkboxes. A "Request a Quote" button triggers a success popup (which auto-hides after 5 seconds and now navigates to '/dashboard') if at least one option is selected; otherwise, a warning is shown.  The consistent use of a warning notification system across components is a recurring element in the code.


## 5:40:32 PM
The log shows updates to three React components related to press release distribution: `DistributionPackages.js`, `DistributionUpgrades.js`, and `BrandStory.js`.  All changes occurred on June 9th, 2025, between 4:43 PM and 4:44 PM.

`DistributionPackages.js` (4:43:41 PM): This component allows users to select distribution packages.  It defines two tiers of packages: "top tier" and "standard," each with several options.  The code manages user selections using `localStorage` to persist choices between page visits. A key feature is the use of a warning notification to ensure the user makes a selection before proceeding.  The UI renders package details clearly, differentiating between single and multi-website options using different display formats.

`DistributionUpgrades.js` (4:43:54 PM): This component offers optional upgrades to the selected distribution packages. Users can choose additional websites like Hindustan Times, Live Mint, etc.  It also uses `localStorage` to save user selections and includes a popup to confirm quote requests.  The component displays a summary of included features with all distribution packages and highlights optional upgrades.  Upon quote request, it clears all local storage data related to distribution choices and redirects to the dashboard.

`BrandStory.js` (4:44:05 PM and 4:44:23 PM): This component presents two distribution types: "transparent" (with disclaimer) and "organic" (without disclaimer).  The component's functionality remains the same across both timestamps. Users select a distribution type, and the data is stored in `localStorage`. This component uses visual elements, such as colored boxes and checkmarks, to represent the features associated with each option. The second timestamp reflects a minor revision, likely a simple code style update, as there are no functional changes.


A common pattern across all components is the extensive use of `localStorage` for storing user selections, ensuring persistence of choices between different stages of the press release distribution process.  All components also use a consistent styling approach with similar UI elements and color palettes.  The use of React's `useNavigate` hook is consistent across all components for navigation management.


## 7:43:10 PM
Between 6:59 PM and 7:22 PM on June 9th, 2025, several files within the `LMS_frontend` directory of a Learning Management System (LMS) project underwent modifications.

The most significant changes involved `Footer2.js`.  Initially, this file imported `react-router-dom`'s `Link` component.  Subsequent updates, occurring around 7:01 PM and 7:02 PM, switched the import to `next/link`, indicating a migration from React Router to Next.js's routing solution. There were further changes to the `Logo` import path, initially set to `../../assets/Logo/Logo-Full-Light.png`, then to `../../../public/` and finally settling on `../../../public/Dunamis.png`. The `img` tag was also replaced with `next/image` component, with explicit width and height attributes, around 7:08 PM.  Finally, around 7:12 PM,  the `Footer2.js` component was entirely commented out, suggesting it might have been temporarily disabled or replaced.  At 7:18 PM, the styling of `Footer2.js` was significantly updated, changing the color scheme from the `richblack` theme to hex codes.


`footer-links.js` was updated at 7:01 PM, adding a structured list of links organized under "Subjects," "Languages," and "Career Building."  This suggests the addition of new navigation elements to the footer of the LMS.

The `app/page.js` file shows the structure of the landing page.  It includes imports for various components and the commented-out sections suggest components might have been temporarily removed or under development. The `Footer2` component was added back into the page around 7:09 PM and subsequently removed again around 7:22PM.


The `app/layout.js` file experienced several edits between 7:20 PM and 7:22 PM.  These edits involved toggling the inclusion of `Footer` and `Footer2` components, suggesting a trial and error process of selecting the appropriate footer for the application.  The final version retained the `Footer` component.

In summary, the log indicates a significant refactoring effort focused primarily on the footer component and a change to Next.js for routing and image display.  There was also some experimentation between different footer components.


## 10:26:12 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `TeachersTestimonials.js` between 9:30 PM and 9:35 PM on June 9th, 2025.  These edits appear to be minor formatting changes and do not significantly alter the component's functionality. The code remains largely the same, displaying a carousel of teacher testimonials with loading and error states.  The component fetches teacher data using a custom hook (`useTeacherStore`), filters for active teachers, and maps the data for display.  Extensive `console.log` statements suggest debugging efforts.  A `Link` component from `next/link` was added in one of the edits, though it isn't fully implemented in the final version.

A separate file, `Faqs.js`, was updated at 10:24 PM on the same day.  This file shows a React component displaying a frequently asked questions (FAQ) section.  The changes between the two timestamps for this file are insignificant, indicating no functional change.  The component uses `lucide-react` icons for expanding and collapsing FAQ entries.  The styling suggests a focus on visual presentation.
