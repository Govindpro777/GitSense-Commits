# Activity Summary for 6/17/2025

## 10:39:49 AM
The code consists of two main files: `UsageAndPerformance.jsx` and `BrandReport.tsx`.

`UsageAndPerformance.jsx` (6/17/2025, 10:32:44 AM): This component renders a usage and performance report. It takes `data` as a prop and uses `useMemo` to create an array of report items.  Each item displays an image, title, and statistic from the provided data (e.g., total usage hours, campaigns created, prospects targeted). The component utilizes a styled grid layout for presentation.  The report also includes a section summarizing Platform ROI, hours saved by automation, and calculated savings.

`BrandReport.tsx` (6/17/2025, 10:39:03 AM): This component is a more complex React component responsible for generating and sending brand reports. It fetches data for various report sections (monthly report details, search and campaign graphs, user performance, top campaigns, and month comparisons) via API calls to `/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/MonthlyReportSearchGraph`, `/MonthlyReportCampaignGraph`, `/MonthlyUserWisePerfomance`, `/MonthlyTop3Campaigns`, and `/MonthlyComparisonLastSixMonths`. The data is then used to render report sections using other components (`MonthlyReport`, `UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `Narratives2`, `Narratives`).  The component implements PDF generation using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`, converting sections of the report to a PDF. It also includes functionality to send reports to individual clients or all clients via an API endpoint `/send-client-report`. Error handling and loading states are implemented.  The component uses SweetAlert for user confirmations and feedback. A significant portion of the code handles sending reports to multiple clients, including status tracking and a summary presentation upon completion.  The functions `downloadPDF` and `generatePdfBlob` share substantial code for PDF generation.  There is asynchronous logic throughout the file, using `Promise.all` for API calls and `async/await` to manage asynchronous tasks.


## 10:39:54 AM
The log shows a React component (`ImageSearch.jsx`) undergoing significant modifications between 9:55 AM and 10:29 AM on June 17, 2025.  The main changes revolve around commenting out the entire component's code.  Initially, the component was fully functional, handling image uploads, database additions, searches, and display.  It used the `lucide-react` library for icons and fetched data from an API (`API_BASE_URL`, potentially configured via environment variables).  The code implemented features like image validation (type and size), pagination, sorting, and visual feedback (success/error messages).

The most substantial change happened sometime between 9:56 AM and 10:29 AM, where the entire code within the component was commented out. This suggests a potential refactoring, debugging process, or temporary disabling of the component.  There is no other noticeable pattern in the code changes other than the commenting out and no uncommented code was added.


## 11:39:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `UsageAndPerformance.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`, and one to `Narratives.tsx`.  The changes primarily involve styling adjustments and minor content modifications within the components.

`UsageAndPerformance.tsx` underwent several revisions between 10:40:06 AM and 10:45:34 AM.  These revisions mainly focused on refining the styling of the component, including changes to colors, fonts, and layout using Tailwind CSS classes. The core functionality, displaying usage and performance data based on the `data` prop, remained consistent throughout the revisions.  A notable change at 10:45:34 AM updated the header text in a table from "Heading" to "Column heading".

`BrandSummary.tsx` was updated once at 10:44:46 AM. This revision introduced a React component displaying brand summary data using charts (ReactApexChart and ReactSpeedometer). The component incorporates dummy data for fallback when API calls fail and uses this data to populate multiple charts that show information regarding publications, journalists, quality of mentions, and regional split, as well as sentiment score.


`Narratives.tsx` was updated at 10:45:04 AM. The original code was commented out, replacing it with a new component named `CombinedNarratives`. This new component displays a timeline chart (`ReactApexChart`) and a section for individual narratives. Each narrative includes details like title, author, sources, publication information, description, and links. The timeline chart shows the number of mentions over a period of time. The styling is consistent with the other components, leveraging Tailwind CSS.  Importantly, the file was completely refactored to utilize `ReactApexChart` for the timeline visualization instead of a previously used `TimelineChart` component.


## 11:39:53 AM
The `ImageSearch.jsx` component, updated on June 17, 2025, at 11:25:43 AM, implements an image search functionality.  It uses a backend API (defaulting to `https://image-search-api-dch5.onrender.com`) to upload, search, and manage images.

**Key Features and Updates:**

* **Image Upload and Search:** The component allows users to upload images, which are then sent to the API for similarity-based searching.  The search results display image URLs, names, similarity scores (as percentages), and file formats.  Results are paginated (20 items per page).
* **Database Management:**  A function (`handleAddImageToDatabase`) adds uploaded images to the backend database, generating sequential filenames (e.g., IMG00001.jpg).  It handles error checking for file types and sizes.
* **Error and Success Handling:**  The component displays success and error messages with automatic timeout mechanisms (5 seconds for success, 8 seconds for errors).
* **View Mode and Sorting:**  Users can switch between grid and list views and sort results by similarity or name (ascending or descending).
* **Filtering:** Results can be filtered based on a minimum similarity threshold.
* **Drag and Drop Support:** The component supports dragging and dropping images for upload.
* **Image Download and Viewing:** Users can download or open images in a new tab.
* **Client-side Validation:**  The code includes validations for file type (image only) and size (10MB limit).
* **State Management:**  Extensive use of React's `useState` hook manages various aspects, including uploaded image, search results, loading state, error messages, view mode, sorting criteria, pagination, and more.

**Specific File Changes:**

The entire file was likely modified to implement the above features.  No granular changes are detailed, only the complete code. The component fetches data using `fetch` API calls to interact with the backend API at various endpoints (`/list`, `/add`, `/search`).


**Recurring Elements:**

* **Error Handling:** Consistent use of `try...catch` blocks for error handling in various asynchronous operations (loading images, adding images, searching images, downloading images).
* **API Interaction:**  Extensive use of `fetch` for communication with the backend API.
* **State Management:**  Multiple `useState` hooks manage the application state effectively.  The `useEffect` hook manages side effects like loading images, clearing messages, etc.
* **File Validation:** Checks for image file type and size are repeated in several functions.
