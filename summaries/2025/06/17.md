# Activity Summary for 6/17/2025

## 10:39:49 AM
The code consists of two main files: `UsageAndPerformance.jsx` and `BrandReport.tsx`.

`UsageAndPerformance.jsx` (6/17/2025, 10:32:44 AM): This component renders a usage and performance report. It takes `data` as a prop and uses `useMemo` to create an array of report items.  Each item displays an image, title, and statistic from the provided data (e.g., total usage hours, campaigns created, prospects targeted). The component utilizes a styled grid layout for presentation.  The report also includes a section summarizing Platform ROI, hours saved by automation, and calculated savings.

`BrandReport.tsx` (6/17/2025, 10:39:03 AM): This component is a more complex React component responsible for generating and sending brand reports. It fetches data for various report sections (monthly report details, search and campaign graphs, user performance, top campaigns, and month comparisons) via API calls to `/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/MonthlyReportSearchGraph`, `/MonthlyReportCampaignGraph`, `/MonthlyUserWisePerfomance`, `/MonthlyTop3Campaigns`, and `/MonthlyComparisonLastSixMonths`. The data is then used to render report sections using other components (`MonthlyReport`, `UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `Narratives2`, `Narratives`).  The component implements PDF generation using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`, converting sections of the report to a PDF. It also includes functionality to send reports to individual clients or all clients via an API endpoint `/send-client-report`. Error handling and loading states are implemented.  The component uses SweetAlert for user confirmations and feedback. A significant portion of the code handles sending reports to multiple clients, including status tracking and a summary presentation upon completion.  The functions `downloadPDF` and `generatePdfBlob` share substantial code for PDF generation.  There is asynchronous logic throughout the file, using `Promise.all` for API calls and `async/await` to manage asynchronous tasks.


## 10:39:54 AM
The log shows a React component (`ImageSearch.jsx`) undergoing significant modifications between 9:55 AM and 10:29 AM on June 17, 2025.  The main changes revolve around commenting out the entire component's code.  Initially, the component was fully functional, handling image uploads, database additions, searches, and display.  It used the `lucide-react` library for icons and fetched data from an API (`API_BASE_URL`, potentially configured via environment variables).  The code implemented features like image validation (type and size), pagination, sorting, and visual feedback (success/error messages).

The most substantial change happened sometime between 9:56 AM and 10:29 AM, where the entire code within the component was commented out. This suggests a potential refactoring, debugging process, or temporary disabling of the component.  There is no other noticeable pattern in the code changes other than the commenting out and no uncommented code was added.


## 11:39:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `UsageAndPerformance.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`, and one to `Narratives.tsx`.  The changes primarily involve styling adjustments and minor content modifications within the components.

`UsageAndPerformance.tsx` underwent several revisions between 10:40:06 AM and 10:45:34 AM.  These revisions mainly focused on refining the styling of the component, including changes to colors, fonts, and layout using Tailwind CSS classes. The core functionality, displaying usage and performance data based on the `data` prop, remained consistent throughout the revisions.  A notable change at 10:45:34 AM updated the header text in a table from "Heading" to "Column heading".

`BrandSummary.tsx` was updated once at 10:44:46 AM. This revision introduced a React component displaying brand summary data using charts (ReactApexChart and ReactSpeedometer). The component incorporates dummy data for fallback when API calls fail and uses this data to populate multiple charts that show information regarding publications, journalists, quality of mentions, and regional split, as well as sentiment score.


`Narratives.tsx` was updated at 10:45:04 AM. The original code was commented out, replacing it with a new component named `CombinedNarratives`. This new component displays a timeline chart (`ReactApexChart`) and a section for individual narratives. Each narrative includes details like title, author, sources, publication information, description, and links. The timeline chart shows the number of mentions over a period of time. The styling is consistent with the other components, leveraging Tailwind CSS.  Importantly, the file was completely refactored to utilize `ReactApexChart` for the timeline visualization instead of a previously used `TimelineChart` component.
