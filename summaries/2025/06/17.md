# Activity Summary for 6/17/2025

## 10:39:49 AM
The code consists of two main files: `UsageAndPerformance.jsx` and `BrandReport.tsx`.

`UsageAndPerformance.jsx` (6/17/2025, 10:32:44 AM): This component renders a usage and performance report. It takes `data` as a prop and uses `useMemo` to create an array of report items.  Each item displays an image, title, and statistic from the provided data (e.g., total usage hours, campaigns created, prospects targeted). The component utilizes a styled grid layout for presentation.  The report also includes a section summarizing Platform ROI, hours saved by automation, and calculated savings.

`BrandReport.tsx` (6/17/2025, 10:39:03 AM): This component is a more complex React component responsible for generating and sending brand reports. It fetches data for various report sections (monthly report details, search and campaign graphs, user performance, top campaigns, and month comparisons) via API calls to `/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/MonthlyReportSearchGraph`, `/MonthlyReportCampaignGraph`, `/MonthlyUserWisePerfomance`, `/MonthlyTop3Campaigns`, and `/MonthlyComparisonLastSixMonths`. The data is then used to render report sections using other components (`MonthlyReport`, `UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `Narratives2`, `Narratives`).  The component implements PDF generation using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`, converting sections of the report to a PDF. It also includes functionality to send reports to individual clients or all clients via an API endpoint `/send-client-report`. Error handling and loading states are implemented.  The component uses SweetAlert for user confirmations and feedback. A significant portion of the code handles sending reports to multiple clients, including status tracking and a summary presentation upon completion.  The functions `downloadPDF` and `generatePdfBlob` share substantial code for PDF generation.  There is asynchronous logic throughout the file, using `Promise.all` for API calls and `async/await` to manage asynchronous tasks.


## 10:39:54 AM
The log shows a React component (`ImageSearch.jsx`) undergoing significant modifications between 9:55 AM and 10:29 AM on June 17, 2025.  The main changes revolve around commenting out the entire component's code.  Initially, the component was fully functional, handling image uploads, database additions, searches, and display.  It used the `lucide-react` library for icons and fetched data from an API (`API_BASE_URL`, potentially configured via environment variables).  The code implemented features like image validation (type and size), pagination, sorting, and visual feedback (success/error messages).

The most substantial change happened sometime between 9:56 AM and 10:29 AM, where the entire code within the component was commented out. This suggests a potential refactoring, debugging process, or temporary disabling of the component.  There is no other noticeable pattern in the code changes other than the commenting out and no uncommented code was added.


## 11:39:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `UsageAndPerformance.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`, and one to `Narratives.tsx`.  The changes primarily involve styling adjustments and minor content modifications within the components.

`UsageAndPerformance.tsx` underwent several revisions between 10:40:06 AM and 10:45:34 AM.  These revisions mainly focused on refining the styling of the component, including changes to colors, fonts, and layout using Tailwind CSS classes. The core functionality, displaying usage and performance data based on the `data` prop, remained consistent throughout the revisions.  A notable change at 10:45:34 AM updated the header text in a table from "Heading" to "Column heading".

`BrandSummary.tsx` was updated once at 10:44:46 AM. This revision introduced a React component displaying brand summary data using charts (ReactApexChart and ReactSpeedometer). The component incorporates dummy data for fallback when API calls fail and uses this data to populate multiple charts that show information regarding publications, journalists, quality of mentions, and regional split, as well as sentiment score.


`Narratives.tsx` was updated at 10:45:04 AM. The original code was commented out, replacing it with a new component named `CombinedNarratives`. This new component displays a timeline chart (`ReactApexChart`) and a section for individual narratives. Each narrative includes details like title, author, sources, publication information, description, and links. The timeline chart shows the number of mentions over a period of time. The styling is consistent with the other components, leveraging Tailwind CSS.  Importantly, the file was completely refactored to utilize `ReactApexChart` for the timeline visualization instead of a previously used `TimelineChart` component.


## 11:39:53 AM
The `ImageSearch.jsx` component, updated on June 17, 2025, at 11:25:43 AM, implements an image search functionality.  It uses a backend API (defaulting to `https://image-search-api-dch5.onrender.com`) to upload, search, and manage images.

**Key Features and Updates:**

* **Image Upload and Search:** The component allows users to upload images, which are then sent to the API for similarity-based searching.  The search results display image URLs, names, similarity scores (as percentages), and file formats.  Results are paginated (20 items per page).
* **Database Management:**  A function (`handleAddImageToDatabase`) adds uploaded images to the backend database, generating sequential filenames (e.g., IMG00001.jpg).  It handles error checking for file types and sizes.
* **Error and Success Handling:**  The component displays success and error messages with automatic timeout mechanisms (5 seconds for success, 8 seconds for errors).
* **View Mode and Sorting:**  Users can switch between grid and list views and sort results by similarity or name (ascending or descending).
* **Filtering:** Results can be filtered based on a minimum similarity threshold.
* **Drag and Drop Support:** The component supports dragging and dropping images for upload.
* **Image Download and Viewing:** Users can download or open images in a new tab.
* **Client-side Validation:**  The code includes validations for file type (image only) and size (10MB limit).
* **State Management:**  Extensive use of React's `useState` hook manages various aspects, including uploaded image, search results, loading state, error messages, view mode, sorting criteria, pagination, and more.

**Specific File Changes:**

The entire file was likely modified to implement the above features.  No granular changes are detailed, only the complete code. The component fetches data using `fetch` API calls to interact with the backend API at various endpoints (`/list`, `/add`, `/search`).


**Recurring Elements:**

* **Error Handling:** Consistent use of `try...catch` blocks for error handling in various asynchronous operations (loading images, adding images, searching images, downloading images).
* **API Interaction:**  Extensive use of `fetch` for communication with the backend API.
* **State Management:**  Multiple `useState` hooks manage the application state effectively.  The `useEffect` hook manages side effects like loading images, clearing messages, etc.
* **File Validation:** Checks for image file type and size are repeated in several functions.


## 1:39:54 PM
The log shows several code changes related to a React application generating and sending brand reports.  The updates span June 17th, 2025, between approximately 1:11 PM and 1:24 PM.

The `TimeLine.tsx` component (1:11:24 PM) renders a line chart using `react-apexcharts`, displaying data related to "Groww Receives CCI Approval for Bonus Shares and Voting Rights Restructuring".  The chart's styling was updated, primarily changing axis and label colors to black and adjusting font weights. The x-axis labels are all the same date ('01-04-25').

The `Narratives2.tsx` component was modified twice (1:12:28 PM and 1:13:08 PM). This component displays narrative data, including title, author, sources, publication details, description, and links.  The data seems to be about the same Groww news item mentioned in `TimeLine.tsx`. No functional changes are observed between the two commits of this file.

The `Narratives.tsx` component (1:13:24 PM) combines a line chart (similar to `TimeLine.tsx`) with the narrative data display (similar to `Narratives2.tsx`).  It uses `react-apexcharts` for the chart and renders the same Groww news item.  The primary difference seems to be the structure and layout compared to `Narratives2.tsx`, potentially for different report sections.

The `BrandReport.tsx` component underwent multiple revisions (1:18:09 PM, 1:22:47 PM, 1:24:05 PM, 1:24:27 PM). This component is responsible for generating and sending PDF reports. It fetches data using a `userService`, likely making API calls to retrieve report data.  The component uses `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` to convert HTML sections into a PDF. The final commit in this file resulted in the entire file being commented out. The initial version contains functions for generating a PDF and sending it via email to multiple clients. It uses `sweetalert2` for user confirmations and progress updates during the sending process. The component handles multiple clients, fetching data for each client individually before creating the PDF.  The process involves multiple API calls for each client to retrieve different parts of the report. The significant updates involve the addition of functionality for sending reports to multiple clients and handling the responses, using a SweetAlert component for displaying successes and failures.  The final versions commented out this entire component.

In summary, the code changes demonstrate the development of a report generation system.  There is a clear focus on presenting data related to Groww's CCI approval, likely reflecting a specific brand report.  The multiple revisions of `BrandReport.tsx` suggest iterative development and debugging of the email sending functionality. The final removal of this component suggests that this might have been an initial implementation and that a different approach was used instead.


## 2:39:58 PM
The log shows iterative changes to React components for a brand monthly report.  The `Narratives.tsx` file underwent several revisions, initially containing a line chart and narrative data, then simplifying to just the narrative data display.  The changes between 1:41 PM and 1:43 PM primarily involved refining the type definitions (`interface CombinedNarrativesProps`) for better type safety.  A second component, `Narratives2.tsx`, was added around 1:42 PM and  also received minor type definition improvements around 1:43 PM. This component also displays narrative data, but it seems to have a simpler structure than `Narratives.tsx`.  `BrandSummary.tsx` was modified around 1:44 PM and 2:29 PM, showcasing the evolution of a component displaying brand summary data through charts (`ReactApexChart`, `ReactSpeedometer`). The initial version used dummy data if API calls failed. The later version appears to have removed the chart rendering logic and is commented out.  The `BrandReport.tsx` file, containing commented-out code for PDF generation using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`, remained largely unchanged throughout the log, suggesting the PDF generation functionality was not implemented or was temporarily disabled.  The final versions of `Narratives.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`  are significantly altered, suggesting refactoring or a major redesign of these components, with a focus on using data received from an API and removing parts that were likely associated with static or dummy data.  The changes are mostly concentrated within a short timeframe (between 1:41 PM and 2:30 PM) and the repeated use of  `"#f5f5f5"` (light gray) and `"#000000"` (black) in the styling suggests a consistent design theme.


## 3:39:56 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `Narratives.tsx` and `BrandReport.tsx`.  The `BrandReport.tsx` file underwent numerous revisions between 2:46 PM and 3:39 PM, with minor changes in code, likely related to refactoring or bug fixes as there are no substantial content changes across these commits.  The majority of the code in this file is commented out, suggesting a work-in-progress state. The commented-out code shows a significant function (`GenerateReport`) responsible for generating and sending PDF reports, heavily using `jsPDF`, `html2canvas`, and a `userService` for API calls.  The many small changes suggest iterative development and debugging of this report generation functionality.


The `Narratives.tsx` file also saw changes at 2:44 PM, 3:22 PM, 3:39 PM. The commented-out code  at 2:44 PM shows a React component that renders a line chart and displays narrative data.  The later updates at 3:22 PM and 3:39 PM  seem to remove some commented-out code and possibly simplify the component.  These changes are relatively minor compared to the extensive modifications in `BrandReport.tsx`.  The  `Narratives2.tsx` file, introduced at 3:38 PM, seems to be a new component that renders narrative data similar to Narratives.tsx but with a slightly different structure.  This suggests a possible effort to refactor or improve the narrative display.
