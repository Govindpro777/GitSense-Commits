# Activity Summary for 6/17/2025

## 10:39:49 AM
The code consists of two main files: `UsageAndPerformance.jsx` and `BrandReport.tsx`.

`UsageAndPerformance.jsx` (6/17/2025, 10:32:44 AM): This component renders a usage and performance report. It takes `data` as a prop and uses `useMemo` to create an array of report items.  Each item displays an image, title, and statistic from the provided data (e.g., total usage hours, campaigns created, prospects targeted). The component utilizes a styled grid layout for presentation.  The report also includes a section summarizing Platform ROI, hours saved by automation, and calculated savings.

`BrandReport.tsx` (6/17/2025, 10:39:03 AM): This component is a more complex React component responsible for generating and sending brand reports. It fetches data for various report sections (monthly report details, search and campaign graphs, user performance, top campaigns, and month comparisons) via API calls to `/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/MonthlyReportSearchGraph`, `/MonthlyReportCampaignGraph`, `/MonthlyUserWisePerfomance`, `/MonthlyTop3Campaigns`, and `/MonthlyComparisonLastSixMonths`. The data is then used to render report sections using other components (`MonthlyReport`, `UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `Narratives2`, `Narratives`).  The component implements PDF generation using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`, converting sections of the report to a PDF. It also includes functionality to send reports to individual clients or all clients via an API endpoint `/send-client-report`. Error handling and loading states are implemented.  The component uses SweetAlert for user confirmations and feedback. A significant portion of the code handles sending reports to multiple clients, including status tracking and a summary presentation upon completion.  The functions `downloadPDF` and `generatePdfBlob` share substantial code for PDF generation.  There is asynchronous logic throughout the file, using `Promise.all` for API calls and `async/await` to manage asynchronous tasks.
