# Activity Summary for 6/6/2025

## 9:07:42 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `App.jsx` component, primarily focused on adding routes for various features of a Learning Management System (LMS) dashboard.  Between 12:15 AM and 12:20 AM, numerous lazy-loaded components were added to the routing configuration, covering features like authentication (`Login`), user profiles (`Profile`),  employee management (`EmployeeManager`, `AddEmployee`, etc.),  institute management (`DemoRequests`, `NotificationsPage`), course management (`CoursePage`, `CourseDashboards`), and inventory management (`Products`, `Orders`, etc.).  A `courseDetails` component was added to the `learningManager/CreateDemo` section at 12:16 AM and underwent minor content changes over the next few minutes (12:18 AM, 12:19 AM). The name of this component was also changed to `CourseDetails` at 12:20 AM, showing a minor refactoring step.

The `DemoDashboard.jsx` file shows the evolution of a component responsible for displaying demo courses.  Initially, the code (before 12:25 AM) was heavily commented out, and contained a significant section of code that managed the displaying and adding of course time slots with UI elements for search, error display, and loading. Later versions introduced a `currentView` state to manage different views ('list', 'detail', 'timeSlot') to improve the usability and structure of the component. A `CourseDetailPage` component was introduced, which likely provides a more detailed view of a specific course.  Changes between 12:25 AM and 12:27 AM show a significant reorganization and cleanup of the code, improving its structure and readability while preserving the core functionality.  The final version at 12:27 AM removed the commented-out code and refined the handling of different views. The updates to `DemoDashboard.jsx` demonstrate a progression towards a more modular and user-friendly interface.

The log shows updates to two React component files within a Learning Management System (LMS) dashboard on June 6th, 2025.

`courseDetails.jsx` (9:38:51 AM): This file was significantly updated to render detailed course information.  The new version displays course details including title, image (with fallback), quick stats (available/booked seats, category, duration), description, requirements, syllabus, instructor information (with name formatting and error handling), and schedule information.  It uses `react-router-dom` for navigation, `lucide-react` for icons, and implements search term highlighting using regular expressions.  Error handling is included in several functions (e.g., `formatTeacherName`, `formatDate`, `getImageUrl`, `highlightSearchTerm`) to gracefully handle missing or invalid data.  A "Course Not Found" message is displayed if the course data is unavailable.  The UI uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

`DemoCards.jsx` (9:39:14 AM): This file displays a list of courses as cards. The update includes features for filtering courses based on a search term (subject, description, category, teacher name), displaying a limited number of courses per page (with implied pagination, though the code for pagination is incomplete in the provided log), and providing actions to view, edit, and delete courses.  Similar to `courseDetails.jsx`, it uses `lucide-react` for icons, handles image loading errors with a placeholder, and implements search term highlighting.  The commented-out code suggests earlier versions included pagination and modals for delete and view confirmations.  Error handling is built into functions for teacher name formatting, date formatting, image handling, and search term highlighting.
