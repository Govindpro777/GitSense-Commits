# Activity Summary for 6/6/2025

## 9:07:42 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `App.jsx` component, primarily focused on adding routes for various features of a Learning Management System (LMS) dashboard.  Between 12:15 AM and 12:20 AM, numerous lazy-loaded components were added to the routing configuration, covering features like authentication (`Login`), user profiles (`Profile`),  employee management (`EmployeeManager`, `AddEmployee`, etc.),  institute management (`DemoRequests`, `NotificationsPage`), course management (`CoursePage`, `CourseDashboards`), and inventory management (`Products`, `Orders`, etc.).  A `courseDetails` component was added to the `learningManager/CreateDemo` section at 12:16 AM and underwent minor content changes over the next few minutes (12:18 AM, 12:19 AM). The name of this component was also changed to `CourseDetails` at 12:20 AM, showing a minor refactoring step.

The `DemoDashboard.jsx` file shows the evolution of a component responsible for displaying demo courses.  Initially, the code (before 12:25 AM) was heavily commented out, and contained a significant section of code that managed the displaying and adding of course time slots with UI elements for search, error display, and loading. Later versions introduced a `currentView` state to manage different views ('list', 'detail', 'timeSlot') to improve the usability and structure of the component. A `CourseDetailPage` component was introduced, which likely provides a more detailed view of a specific course.  Changes between 12:25 AM and 12:27 AM show a significant reorganization and cleanup of the code, improving its structure and readability while preserving the core functionality.  The final version at 12:27 AM removed the commented-out code and refined the handling of different views. The updates to `DemoDashboard.jsx` demonstrate a progression towards a more modular and user-friendly interface.
