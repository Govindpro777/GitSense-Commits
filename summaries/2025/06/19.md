# Activity Summary for 6/19/2025

## 11:00:58 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `Create.jsx` and `Discover.jsx`.  Changes span approximately 40 minutes on June 19th, 2025.

`Create.jsx` underwent numerous stylistic changes between 10:41 AM and 10:49 AM.  These modifications primarily focused on the layout and styling of the form, adjusting the `className` attributes of various elements (divs, inputs, labels, buttons, etc.) to refine its visual presentation using Tailwind CSS.  Specifically, the positioning and styling of the form's container within its parent `div` were adjusted multiple times. The text size of the title input field was changed from `text-sm` to `text-md`.  The breadcrumb navigation's styling was also altered, changing the color and font weight of the "Create" element.

`Discover.jsx` shows two edits. One stylistic edit at 10:53 AM that reduced button padding from `px-3 py-2` to `px-2 py-1` in the social media buttons section. Another edit at 10:55 AM added `font-[600]` to the Instagram and Youtube buttons to make the text bolder.  The component initially contained commented-out code for a data table displaying creator information; however, this commented-out section remained unchanged throughout the log.  The `creators` data array remained consistent, containing six identical entries for "Bhuvam Bam".

The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `Discover.jsx` and `Regional.jsx`.  The changes span approximately one hour on June 19th, 2025.

**`Discover.jsx` (Social Component):** This component underwent significant changes focused primarily on the display of creator data and UI enhancements. Initially, a table displaying creator information was commented out.  Subsequent changes reintroduced the table, making it functional and adding error handling for no results (showing a "No Results Found" message), and added borders to the table cells for better visual presentation.  The initial commits contained a repeated entry for the same creator data.  The final version of the component at 11:57:09 AM shows a fully functional table with border-collapse, error handling and improved styling.  Several intermediate commits show incremental changes to the verification toggle's styling and layout.

**`Regional.jsx` (GEO Component):** This component, a regional media explorer, focuses on selecting states and cities.  The modifications here were primarily focused on bug fixes and improved user experience. Several commits show the progressive implementation of  `handleClickOutside` and `handleMouseLeave` functions to manage dropdown state appropriately, enhancing the user interaction.  The changes also include adding a UUID generation function,  and handling Freebie user account redirection.  The component uses a service (`userService`) to fetch state and city data.  The UI improvements include styling of the UI elements and improving the display of selected cities. The changes between 11:20:54 AM and 11:21:56 AM primarily involved fleshing out the conditional rendering of the state and city dropdowns.
