# Activity Summary for 6/19/2025

## 11:00:58 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `Create.jsx` and `Discover.jsx`.  Changes span approximately 40 minutes on June 19th, 2025.

`Create.jsx` underwent numerous stylistic changes between 10:41 AM and 10:49 AM.  These modifications primarily focused on the layout and styling of the form, adjusting the `className` attributes of various elements (divs, inputs, labels, buttons, etc.) to refine its visual presentation using Tailwind CSS.  Specifically, the positioning and styling of the form's container within its parent `div` were adjusted multiple times. The text size of the title input field was changed from `text-sm` to `text-md`.  The breadcrumb navigation's styling was also altered, changing the color and font weight of the "Create" element.

`Discover.jsx` shows two edits. One stylistic edit at 10:53 AM that reduced button padding from `px-3 py-2` to `px-2 py-1` in the social media buttons section. Another edit at 10:55 AM added `font-[600]` to the Instagram and Youtube buttons to make the text bolder.  The component initially contained commented-out code for a data table displaying creator information; however, this commented-out section remained unchanged throughout the log.  The `creators` data array remained consistent, containing six identical entries for "Bhuvam Bam".
