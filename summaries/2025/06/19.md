# Activity Summary for 6/19/2025

## 11:00:58 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `Create.jsx` and `Discover.jsx`.  Changes span approximately 40 minutes on June 19th, 2025.

`Create.jsx` underwent numerous stylistic changes between 10:41 AM and 10:49 AM.  These modifications primarily focused on the layout and styling of the form, adjusting the `className` attributes of various elements (divs, inputs, labels, buttons, etc.) to refine its visual presentation using Tailwind CSS.  Specifically, the positioning and styling of the form's container within its parent `div` were adjusted multiple times. The text size of the title input field was changed from `text-sm` to `text-md`.  The breadcrumb navigation's styling was also altered, changing the color and font weight of the "Create" element.

`Discover.jsx` shows two edits. One stylistic edit at 10:53 AM that reduced button padding from `px-3 py-2` to `px-2 py-1` in the social media buttons section. Another edit at 10:55 AM added `font-[600]` to the Instagram and Youtube buttons to make the text bolder.  The component initially contained commented-out code for a data table displaying creator information; however, this commented-out section remained unchanged throughout the log.  The `creators` data array remained consistent, containing six identical entries for "Bhuvam Bam".


## 12:01:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `Discover.jsx` and `Regional.jsx`.  The changes span approximately one hour on June 19th, 2025.

**`Discover.jsx` (Social Component):** This component underwent significant changes focused primarily on the display of creator data and UI enhancements. Initially, a table displaying creator information was commented out.  Subsequent changes reintroduced the table, making it functional and adding error handling for no results (showing a "No Results Found" message), and added borders to the table cells for better visual presentation.  The initial commits contained a repeated entry for the same creator data.  The final version of the component at 11:57:09 AM shows a fully functional table with border-collapse, error handling and improved styling.  Several intermediate commits show incremental changes to the verification toggle's styling and layout.

**`Regional.jsx` (GEO Component):** This component, a regional media explorer, focuses on selecting states and cities.  The modifications here were primarily focused on bug fixes and improved user experience. Several commits show the progressive implementation of  `handleClickOutside` and `handleMouseLeave` functions to manage dropdown state appropriately, enhancing the user interaction.  The changes also include adding a UUID generation function,  and handling Freebie user account redirection.  The component uses a service (`userService`) to fetch state and city data.  The UI improvements include styling of the UI elements and improving the display of selected cities. The changes between 11:20:54 AM and 11:21:56 AM primarily involved fleshing out the conditional rendering of the state and city dropdowns.


## 1:01:04 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `Discover.jsx` on June 19th, 2025, between 12:17 PM and 12:56 PM.  The component is a React component that displays a table of creators, allowing users to filter them by various criteria (category, subcategory, location, gender, language, verified status).

Initial versions (12:17 PM) defined state variables for search and filter terms and hardcoded a list of creators. A `DropdownSelect` component was created for reusable filter dropdowns. The UI included a search bar, filter dropdowns, a "verified" toggle, and a table displaying creator data.  A significant change at 12:18:24 PM introduced the `getSelectedFilters` function, which compiles selected filters into an array of objects.

Further modifications between 12:18:35 PM and 12:21:17 PM focused on adding filter removal functionality via the `removeFilter` function and displaying active filters in the UI.  The display style of active filters also changed from a plain text list to colored boxes with close buttons. The color of the filter boxes also changed from `#528DC3` to `#F4BB3F` between 12:24:09 PM and 12:24:59 PM.

Around 12:54 PM, a modal for "Advance Filters" was introduced using a state variable `showModal`.  This modal allows for more granular filtering using range inputs for metrics like "Engagement Rate," "Effective Followers," and view counts. The final changes involved refining the UI and positioning of the "Advance Filters" modal, and correcting some minor formatting issues.  The most significant updates concerned the addition of filter management functions and the implementation of the advanced filters modal.  There is a pattern of iterative refinements to the UI and functionality throughout the log.  Finally, at 12:48 PM and 12:49 PM, the entire code was commented out and then restored.  This may indicate a temporary removal of the component for testing or other purposes before being reinstated.


## 2:11:11 PM
The log shows iterative development of a React component (`Discover.jsx`) for a social media influencer discovery feature and a related campaign form (`Create.jsx`).  The `Discover.jsx` component underwent significant changes related to filtering and search functionality.  Initially, the component had a simple filtering mechanism based on individual filter selections.  Later updates changed this to a multi-select approach, allowing users to select multiple options from each filter category. This is evident in the shift from single state variables (e.g., `category`, `subCategory`) to state variables that hold arrays of selected options (e.g., `categories`, `subCategories`).  The `getSelectedFilters` function's implementation also reflects this change.  A crucial addition was the `removeFilter` function, which allows users to remove individual filter selections in the multi-select implementation. The changes between 1:55 PM and 2:04 PM  show the evolution of the filtering logic from returning all options in `getSelectedFilters` to only the selected filters.  The `removeFilter` function also changed to handle the removal of values from the array states instead of setting them to an empty string. Furthermore, the search functionality was enhanced to allow searching by creator name or handle.  The implementation of an external modal for advanced filters, with a click-outside handler to close it, was added around 1:14 PM. The addition of the `useRouter` hook and the  `handleShortlistClick` function in `Discover.jsx` (around 1:44 PM)  introduces navigation functionality, pushing to a '/discover-social' route.

The `Create.jsx` component, a campaign form, saw incremental improvements.  Initially, only a basic form was present, while subsequent updates added start and end date pickers and improved the styling and button functionality. The addition of the `useRouter` hook and a condition within `handleShortlistClick` function in `Create.jsx` ensures the route change only happens when the form validation passes (around 1:48 PM).  This suggests a focus on improving the user experience and ensuring data integrity.
