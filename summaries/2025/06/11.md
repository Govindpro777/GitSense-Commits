# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 4:19:15 AM
The log shows updates to three files in a React-based frontend application, likely an LMS (Learning Management System).

The most significant changes are in `Navigation.js` (12:41:25 AM), which implements a responsive navigation bar with user authentication.  The navigation bar includes links to home, about us, courses, products (external link), and contact us.  A user profile section appears after login, displaying user details and providing links to a dashboard and logout functionality. A mobile-friendly menu is implemented using the `useState` hook to manage its visibility.  The component uses Lucide React icons for various elements.  The authentication logic leverages a custom `useAuth` hook.

`Testimonials.js` (12:43:40 AM) introduces a carousel of client testimonials using Swiper.js.  The carousel adapts to screen size (1, 2, or 3 slides visible), features custom navigation arrows appearing on hover and pagination dots.  The component is designed to be responsive and incorporates mouse-hover effects to reveal navigation buttons.

Finally, `page.js` (12:44:45 AM) acts as the main application component, importing and rendering various other components, assembling the overall landing page layout. Several components are commented out, suggesting they may be undergoing development or temporarily disabled.  The component structure suggests a well-organized landing page with sections for landing information, about us, features, testimonials, FAQs, and contact information, along with a floating WhatsApp button for quick access.

The timestamp sequence suggests a sequential development process, with the navigation bar built first, followed by the testimonials carousel and then assembling the page structure.  There is a recurring use of React components, custom styling, and the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks across all components.  The code uses responsive design principles with media queries.


## 9:46:27 AM
The `AppRoutes.js` file was updated on June 11, 2025, at 9:33:55 AM.  The update involved a significant restructuring of routes, primarily focusing on lazy loading numerous React components. Many components related to campaigns, media lists, dashboards, social media (Instagram, Twitter, Podcast), account settings, forgot password functionality, and various report sections were either added, updated, or reorganized.  Several components were commented out, suggesting potential refactoring or removal.  The changes introduced a new set of components under the `BeforeLoginPages` directory, replacing or reorganizing previously existing components related to the pre-login user experience (e.g.,  Home page, database, connect, monitoring).  A notable shift involved moving components related to legal pages (privacy policy, terms and conditions) to a new 'Legal' directory.  The addition of many new components under "BeforeLoginPages" suggests a significant overhaul of the pre-login user interface and experience.  The use of lazy loading (`React.lazy`) significantly improves initial load times by only loading components when they are needed.


## 10:46:30 AM
The log shows multiple edits to three React component files (`NonDisclaimer.js`, `DistributionUpgrades.js`, and `BrandStory.js`) between 10:30 AM and 10:44 AM on June 11, 2025.  The changes primarily involve UI enhancements and improvements to navigation and local storage handling.

`NonDisclaimer.js`:  This file underwent several revisions.  Early versions were commented-out, suggesting iterative development. The final version (10:39:33 AM) adds a "Go Back" button, removes the automatic navigation to `/dashboard` after 5 seconds in the `handleRequestQuote` function, instead opting for immediate popup display and later independent navigation to `/dashboard`.  The popup modal's styling was also slightly adjusted.

`DistributionUpgrades.js`: This file also shows iterative development with initial commented-out code. The final version (10:39:47 AM)  includes a refined UI with checkboxes for selecting optional website postings, and adds a count of selected upgrades to the popup modal.  The most significant change is shifting the clearing of local storage (`distributionPackages`, `distributionUpgrades`, `brandStorySelection`) to occur after a 5-second delay within the `handleRequestQuote` function, independent of the popup closure.  The file uses local storage extensively to manage user selections.

`BrandStory.js`: This file was edited once (10:44:42 AM).  It introduces a component that guides users to choose between "Transparent Distribution" (with a disclaimer) and "Organic Look Distribution" (without a disclaimer), storing the selection in local storage (`brandStorySelection`) before navigating to the appropriate component (`/pressrelease/disclamer` or `/pressrelease/nondisclamer`).  This component includes a visually appealing UI with checkmarks and styling.

A recurring pattern across all files is the use of local storage to persist user selections and the use of a 5-second delay before navigating to the `/dashboard` route after a quote request.  The consistent use of a popup modal to indicate successful quote requests is another recurring element. The styling throughout uses Tailwind CSS classes.


## 11:49:01 AM
The log shows updates to two files on June 11, 2025.

`Sidebar.jsx` was updated at 11:36:43 AM.  This file is a React component representing a sidebar menu.  The key change is the implementation of a dynamic menu based on user role (`userInfo` from localStorage).  Different user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Cutout, Accounts, Display) have distinct menu items, each with a corresponding icon and route path. The sidebar also includes a logout button, which removes user tokens from localStorage.  The styling uses Tailwind CSS.

`ImageSearch.jsx` was updated at 11:37:24 AM, shortly after `Sidebar.jsx`. This file is a simple React component that displays "Image Search," suggesting it's a placeholder or a very basic page for image searching functionality.  No significant changes are noted beyond this initial creation or minimal update.


## 1:15:05 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files between 12:39 PM and 1:14 PM on June 11, 2025.

`api.ts`: This file, updated once at 12:39 PM,  contains code for an Axios API instance.  Key features include:  handling of access tokens (including refresh token logic),  setting base URLs (with commented-out alternatives suggesting a potential migration between development, beta, and production environments), and custom error handling (specifically for network errors and 401 unauthorized responses). The `Alert` component is used for displaying user notifications.

`EditJournalist.tsx`: This React component, updated multiple times between 12:41 PM and 1:14 PM, manages the editing of journalist profiles.  The numerous updates appear to focus on refining the component's functionality and data handling. The component makes extensive use of the `userService` for fetching and updating data, including interacting with endpoints for outlets, supplements, shows, and sub-beats.  The code utilizes `react-select` for dropdown selections and `formik` and `Yup` for form validation, including custom validation rules for journalist names.  There are several state variables managing various aspects of the journalist data, and there are multiple asynchronous operations using `userService.get` and `userService.post`. The frequent revisions may indicate iterative development, debugging, or the addition of new features.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout the revisions, which primarily involve adding or modifying existing methods for data fetching and form handling.


## 2:15:04 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EditJournalist.tsx` on June 11th, 2025, between 1:22 PM and 1:54 PM.  The file is a React component responsible for editing journalist information.  There are no functional changes in the code across all revisions; all changes appear to be minor formatting edits within the code. The component heavily uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), `react-select` for dropdown menus, `formik` and `Yup` for form validation, and makes numerous calls to a `userService` for fetching and updating data (e.g., fetching cities based on state selection, getting sub-beats based on beat selection, and fetching outlets based on media selection).  The component includes functionality for adding supplements, titles, and shows, managed through modal components.  The  `userService` interacts with backend APIs using both `GET` and `POST` requests.  The form validation includes rules for gender selection and complex name validation checks to prevent certain prefixes and abbreviations, and to enforce proper casing.  There's also commented-out code related to state and city handling, suggesting a possible evolution of the component's data fetching strategy.


## 3:15:02 PM
The provided code represents a React component (`EditJournalist`) for editing journalist information.  Multiple changes across three timestamps show iterative development. The core functionality remains consistent: fetching and updating journalist data using `userService` API calls.

The component uses `react-router-dom`, `react-redux`, `formik`, and `yup` for routing, state management, form handling, and validation respectively.  It interacts with several other components: `Alert`, `CustomAlert`, `ModalComponent`, `Supplement`, `Title`, and `Shows`.

Significant changes involve the `onOutletChange` function.  Initially, this function had separate API calls for `supplements` and `shows` based on `isNational` and `isBroadcast` flags.  Later, it was refactored to use `Promise.all` to make both calls concurrently when both flags are true, significantly improving efficiency.  Another improvement is in `onStateChange`, which handles state and city updates more robustly, correctly handling empty or single selections for better user experience.

The `validationSchema` for journalist names was also added or significantly improved, implementing checks for forbidden prefixes, full stops, and proper casing.  This indicates an effort towards enhancing data quality and preventing invalid entries.  All three timestamps show the same core code, suggesting the main changes were focused on refining the existing functionality rather than major structural changes.  The timestamps are tightly clustered, indicating rapid development and iterative refinement within a short timeframe (approximately 18 minutes).


## 5:15:03 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `EditJournalist.tsx` file between 4:31 PM and 5:05 PM on June 11, 2025.  The file is a React component for editing journalist information.  There were no functional changes in the code during these revisions.  All the commits seem to be the same codebase, with no substantive differences between the various timestamps. The code uses React Router, Redux, Formik, Yup for validation, and makes numerous calls to a `userService` for fetching and updating data related to journalists, including media, beats, outlets, supplements, and shows.  The component includes features for adding titles, shows, and supplements, managed through a modal.  The component also has extensive validation rules for journalist names, ensuring they're in proper case and don't begin with certain titles or contain full stops.  The repeated identical commits suggest a potential issue with the version control system or a series of accidental check-ins of the same code.


## 7:49:13 PM
The log shows updates to the M_Frontend application.  A `ImageSearch.jsx` component was significantly modified on June 11th, 2025, at 6:05:03 PM.  This component now implements image search functionality, including image upload via drag-and-drop or file selection, search for similar images (using mocked data for now), and display of results in grid or list view.  The results can be filtered by minimum similarity and sorted by similarity or name, ascending or descending.  The UI is built using React and Lucide-React for icons.  The component uses state variables to manage the uploaded image, search results, loading state, and view/sort options.  The commented-out code suggests that an earlier, simpler version of the component existed.


## 7:49:15 PM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts` on June 11, 2025, at 5:36:10 PM.  This file contains an Axios instance configuration for handling API requests.  Key updates include:

* **Multiple Base URLs:** The code initially comments out several base URLs (`https://localhost:44323/v1`, `https://beta.goskribe.com/API/v1`, `https://www.goskribe.com/API/v1`), ultimately using a dynamically determined base URL from a `getBaseURL()` function.

* **Authentication and Refresh Token Handling:**  The code implements robust token management using `TokenService`.  It intercepts requests to add an authorization header with an access token.  Upon receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response, it attempts to refresh the access token using a refresh token. If refresh fails, it clears tokens and redirects to the login page (`/`).  Error handling includes network error alerts displayed via an `Alert` component.  A mechanism prevents multiple simultaneous refresh token requests.

* **Error Handling and Alerting:** The code includes comprehensive error handling, specifically checking for network errors and 401 responses, providing user feedback through the `Alert` component (e.g., network error messages and session expiry alerts).

The significant change is the implementation of the complete access and refresh token management system within the Axios interceptor.  The use of multiple commented-out base URLs suggests potential deployment to different environments (local, beta, production).  The consistent use of `Alert.success` for error messages is a minor stylistic inconsistency.


## 9:40:17 PM
The log shows two nearly identical entries for `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Backend\index.js`.  Both entries represent a Node.js server using Express.js, Socket.IO, and various other packages for file uploads, database connections, and authentication.  The server handles routes for users, admins, designers, super admins, accounts, invoices, and challans.  A significant portion of the code deals with establishing and managing socket connections, including authentication (`socketAuthenticator`) and a socket manager (`socketManager`).  The CORS configuration is meticulously set up to allow connections from specific origins.

The only difference between the two entries is the timestamp; they are recorded 36 seconds apart (7:56:35 PM and 7:57:01 PM). This suggests a minor code change that might have been quickly reverted or a simple log duplication.  The code itself remains unchanged between these two timestamps.
