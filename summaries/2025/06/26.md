# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

## 12:32:02 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `OrderDetailsTab.jsx` between 11:32 PM and 11:40 PM on June 25th, 2025,  with seemingly no functional changes in the code.  The commented-out code remains largely consistent across these revisions, suggesting a possible debugging or experimentation phase.  There's a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling and Lucide React icons for visual elements.  The code displays order details, customer information, requirements, and images.  A key function, `handleStatusUpdate`, allows updating order status via a PUT request to an API endpoint.  The  `OrderGraphicsDetails.jsx` file is updated at 11:43 PM on June 25th, adding image search functionality using an API (`IMAGE_SEARCH_API`).  The search results are displayed with similarity scores and categorized by color-coded similarity percentages.  Finally, `OrderFilesTab.jsx` is modified twice between 11:50 PM and 11:52 PM on June 25th, with no apparent functional changes in the code between these revisions. The component allows for downloading order files (CAD, images, text) individually or as a zip archive. The last file, `ImageSearch.jsx`, modified at 12:01 AM on June 26th, 2025, deals with image uploading, database addition, and search functionalities.  It uses pagination and sorting features and shows error and success messages.
