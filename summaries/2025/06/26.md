# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

## 12:32:02 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `OrderDetailsTab.jsx` between 11:32 PM and 11:40 PM on June 25th, 2025,  with seemingly no functional changes in the code.  The commented-out code remains largely consistent across these revisions, suggesting a possible debugging or experimentation phase.  There's a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling and Lucide React icons for visual elements.  The code displays order details, customer information, requirements, and images.  A key function, `handleStatusUpdate`, allows updating order status via a PUT request to an API endpoint.  The  `OrderGraphicsDetails.jsx` file is updated at 11:43 PM on June 25th, adding image search functionality using an API (`IMAGE_SEARCH_API`).  The search results are displayed with similarity scores and categorized by color-coded similarity percentages.  Finally, `OrderFilesTab.jsx` is modified twice between 11:50 PM and 11:52 PM on June 25th, with no apparent functional changes in the code between these revisions. The component allows for downloading order files (CAD, images, text) individually or as a zip archive. The last file, `ImageSearch.jsx`, modified at 12:01 AM on June 26th, 2025, deals with image uploading, database addition, and search functionalities.  It uses pagination and sorting features and shows error and success messages.


## 10:19:13 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` between 9:26 AM and 9:57 AM on June 26, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged across all revisions; all the timestamps represent minor edits, likely saving or auto-formatting. There are no discernible patterns or recurring content changes beyond the consistent structure of the React component.  The component uses several React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), interacts with a `userService` for fetching data (`GET_CATEGORY_BY_TYPES`), and renders a UI with dropdowns (`DropdownComponent`), tables, and icons.  The code suggests a UI for managing campaign outreach, allowing users to select content type, duration, and quantity, likely for social media campaigns.


## 11:19:12 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two React components: `CampaignOutreach.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`.  The changes span approximately an hour on June 26th, 2025.

`CampaignOutreach.jsx` primarily involves modifications to its file upload functionality.  Early versions used a custom approach to handle the `Content-Type` header in API requests for file uploads, attempting to delete it. Later versions (around 10:49:44 AM and 11:06:26 AM) reverted this and correctly set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data` when using `userService.post` for saving Instagram attachments. There are also minor UI adjustments, such as the styling of a table and the addition of margin (`mt-1`) to a div.  The component consistently uses `userService` and `api` for API interactions, fetching data based on a `campaignId` and handling user notifications.


`Shortlist.jsx` underwent updates focusing on user interface elements and filtering logic. The component fetches shortlisted creator data using `userService.post` with `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA` endpoint.  It incorporates search, verification status, and contact information filtering of creators.  The select-all functionality was improved by ensuring only creators with emails are selected in the 10:48:59 AM update. The UI is enhanced with tooltips and visual feedback for selected creators. There is no change in the core functionality of retrieving and displaying creator data.


## 12:19:28 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx`, a React component likely involved in managing campaign outreach.  The key changes revolve around file uploads, email quota checks, and handling of influencer data.

Initially, the component fetched existing attachments using `userService`, and duration options based on content type using `userService.get`.  It also included a `saveAttachmentsToAPI` function using both `userService.post` and `api.post` for saving attachments.  There's a significant change around  `11:27:10 AM` where `api.post` is removed and `axios.post` is introduced for handling API requests. This suggests a switch to a different HTTP client library or a simplification of the API interaction. Further changes around  `11:35:52 AM`  remove the `userService.post` call, leaving only `axios.post`,  further consolidating the API interaction method.  The `SAVE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS` constant is consistently used for attachment uploads.


Around `11:45:51 AM`, the code starts incorporating email quota checks using a custom hook `useEmailQuota`.  This hook provides information about quota limits, remaining quota, etc., enabling real-time checks on available credits.  The initial implementation checks against a `listBreak` variable, but this is replaced around `11:55:00 AM` with a check against the number of `influencers`. The logic for determining the influencer count is also refined to accommodate different data structures, showing a better handling of varying input formats.


The `CampaignOutreach` component's props are updated to include an `influencers` array around `11:55:00 AM`, and a `getInfluencerCount` helper function is added to handle various influencer data structures. The final version of the component (as of `12:19:04 PM`) efficiently handles email quota checks based on the number of influencers received as props.  A `hideEmailButtons` state variable is also added to control button visibility based on the quota, indicating additional UI/UX refinements.  The component continuously fetches attachments based on the `campId` via `useEffect` ensuring up-to-date information.  Throughout the edits, error handling with `showNotification` and logging using `console.log` and `console.error` remains consistent.

The `EmailPreview.jsx` component, which appears to be related to `CampaignOutreach.jsx`, was updated at `11:57:51 AM` and `12:00:28 PM`. This component generates an email preview based on received data (`attachedImages`, `campaignBrief`, `deliverables`), allowing for content editing and attachment removal. The main functionality is the generation of the full email content by dynamically constructing a markdown-like representation of the email, showing the intended email content.  The changes mostly consist of improvements to how the email content is generated and displayed for users.


## 1:19:16 PM
The provided log shows multiple edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` between 12:19 PM and 12:30 PM on June 26th, 2025, and a single edit to `Shortlist.jsx` at 12:55 PM and 1:00 PM on the same day.  The changes in `CampaignOutreach.jsx` primarily involved refining the file's functionality and not adding new features.  There's a consistent focus on handling file uploads, specifically implementing input validation for file types and sizes (allowing only JPG, PNG, and PDF files up to 5MB), and using `axios` with authentication (`tokenService.getLocalAccessToken()`) to send form data to the `SAVE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS` API endpoint. Several commented-out sections of code suggest experimentation with different API call methods (`userService.post` vs. `axios.post` vs. `api.post`).  The final change adds date and time limits for scheduling.

The edits to `Shortlist.jsx` introduced a table displaying creator data retrieved via `userService.post(GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA, payload)` and `userService.get(`${GET_DRAFT_DATA}/${campaignId}`)`, along with filtering and sorting capabilities based on search terms, verification status, and contact information presence.  A significant change was the addition of a validation check in the `handleEngageButtonClick` function to ensure at least one creator is selected before proceeding.  The update also improved UI elements like adding tooltips.


## 2:19:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `Shortlist.jsx` and `CampaignOutreach.jsx`.  Both underwent significant changes throughout the day on June 26th, 2025.

**`Shortlist.jsx` (6/26/2025, 1:26:32 PM):** This component displays a shortlist of creators. The main update involves creating a searchable and filterable table of creators.  Filtering is implemented for search terms, verified status, and the presence of contact information (prioritizing creators with both email and phone).  The table includes checkboxes for creator selection, enabling bulk actions. The component also fetches data using `userService.post(GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA, payload)` and `userService.get(`${GET_DRAFT_DATA}/${campaignId}`)`, indicating interaction with an API.  Loading and error states are also handled.

**`CampaignOutreach.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component handles campaign outreach.  There are multiple revisions demonstrating iterative development. Key features added include:

* **Attachment Handling:** The component fetches existing attachments via `userService.get(`${GET_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS}/${campId}`)`, allows users to upload new attachments (JPG, PNG, PDF, max 5 files, 5MB each) using `axios.post(SAVE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS, formData)`,  and displays them.  Error handling and notification are included.
* **Email Quota Check:** The component integrates with a `useEmailQuota` hook to check and display the remaining email quota, preventing actions if insufficient credits are available.  A warning message is shown ("You have insufficient email credits...").
* **Scheduling:** A feature was added to allow scheduling, limiting selectable dates/times between 15 minutes and 70 hours from the current time.  Initially, `alert` was used for error handling in date/time selection, later replaced with the `showNotification` function for consistency.
* **Deliverables:** Functionality to add and manage campaign deliverables was developed, allowing selection of content type (Reels, Story, Post) and duration.  The `GET_CATEGORY_BY_TYPES` API call is used to fetch duration options based on content type.

The repeated use of `userService`, `showNotification`, and consistent error handling demonstrates a focus on API interaction and user feedback. The numerous revisions suggest an iterative development process with frequent bug fixes and feature additions to the `CampaignOutreach` component.  The `axios` library was added to handle the upload of attachments.


## 2:23:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Narratives.tsx` file between 2:17 PM and 2:22 PM on June 26, 2025.  The file renders a component displaying brand narratives, including a line chart visualizing narrative mentions over time and a section detailing individual narratives with their sentiment, count, title, author, sources, publication details, description, and links.

The code remains largely unchanged across all revisions.  The key difference is that the `CombinedNarratives` function consistently begins with `// Default to empty` in each revision. This suggests the component is designed to handle cases where data might be absent, but the core structure and functionality do not change.  The data shown in the example is always the same.  The repeated commented-out imports of `React` and `ReactApexChart` and the unchanging commented-out code might indicate an ongoing development or debugging process.  The frequent small commits within a short time frame imply iterative development or testing.


## 3:23:45 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Narratives.tsx` between 2:23 PM and 3:02 PM on June 26, 2025.  The file is a React component that displays brand narratives, likely part of a monthly report.  The code remains largely unchanged throughout the revisions, primarily consisting of commented-out code and a final version that renders a chart and a list of narratives.  The commented-out sections suggest an iterative development process, perhaps experimenting with different chart configurations or data structures.

The most significant change occurs between 2:30:54 PM and 2:32:14 PM, where the final, uncommented version of the component is added. This version handles data rendering, including a line chart using `ReactApexChart` and a styled display of individual narratives with details such as sentiment, author, source, publication, and links. Each narrative is presented in a card-like structure. The data appears to be related to "Groww Receives CCI Approval..." news, repeatedly used in the chart's series data (though the final version likely uses dynamic data).

A separate file, `BrandReport.tsx`, is updated at 2:49:21 PM. This file uses `Narratives.tsx` (and another component `Narratives2`), along with other components, to generate a PDF report.  This file introduces functionality for generating and sending PDF reports using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`.  The  `BrandReport.tsx`  component fetches data from multiple API endpoints (`/MonthlyReportDetails` and `/AIBrandReport`),  manages user interactions (selecting customer, date range), and handles the report generation and sending process, including using SweetAlert for feedback.  The logic also handles sending the report to multiple clients.


## 4:19:15 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EmailPreview.jsx` and one to `constants.js`.  The `EmailPreview.jsx` file underwent significant changes between the first and second timestamps (3:44:28 PM and 3:44:39 PM). The primary alteration was a correction in the `generateFullEmailContent` function; the initial version incorrectly used a variable `greeting` that hadn't been defined in the scope.  This was fixed in the second version by using the values from `editableContent` object directly.

At 3:50:33 PM, the entire content of `EmailPreview.jsx` was commented out, suggesting a temporary removal or rollback of the code. This was short-lived, as the original (corrected) version was restored at 3:52:26 PM.

The `constants.js` file, updated at 4:00:55 PM, contains a large number of API endpoint URLs. These URLs appear to be for various functionalities related to user authentication, campaign management, data retrieval, and other aspects of a web application.  The file uses environment variables (`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...`) to dynamically set some URLs, pointing towards a production-ready deployment strategy. The use of `Url_V1` suggests versioning of the API.

The `CampaignOutreach.jsx` file was also updated at 4:01:16 PM and then commented out at 4:18:48 PM.  This component seems to manage campaign outreach functionalities, including file uploads, email scheduling, and interaction with an email quota system.  It uses React, React Quill for rich text editing, and interacts with backend APIs via `userService` and `axios`. The component displays information regarding the remaining email quota and prevents further actions if the quota is insufficient.  The use of `tokenService` implies the use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.  The commenting out of this file at 4:18:48 PM suggests that it was temporarily removed or disabled.  The component makes extensive use of notifications to the user.

The recurring theme across all files is the interaction with backend APIs, suggesting a client-server architecture for the application.  The use of environment variables, React, and Axios points to a modern web application development approach using Next.js.


## 4:23:49 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `Narratives.tsx` between 3:25 PM and 3:55 PM on June 26th, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor adjustments or possibly debugging attempts, as the core code remains largely unchanged across all revisions. The code within `Narratives.tsx`  renders a report section displaying a line chart and narrative data (likely from an API response).  The chart visualizes "Mentions" over "Dates of Narratives" for a single narrative, "Groww Receives CCI Approval...". The narrative section displays details like sentiment, count, author, sources, publication, and links.  There's no substantive change in functionality across the multiple edits within this timespan.


Between 4:08 PM and 4:13 PM on June 26th, 2025,  `BrandReport.tsx` and `GenerateReport.tsx` were updated. These files implement report generation and sending functionalities.  Both files utilize `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` libraries to convert report sections into PDF documents. `BrandReport.tsx` focuses on brand-specific reports, fetching data using `userService.get` for `/MonthlyReportDetails` and `/AIBrandReport` endpoints.  `GenerateReport.tsx` handles general monthly reports, making multiple API calls using `userService.get` to several different endpoints (`/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/MonthlyReportSearchGraph`, `/MonthlyReportCampaignGraph`, `/MonthlyUserWisePerfomance`, `/MonthlyTop3Campaigns`, `/MonthlyComparisonLastSixMonths`).  Both files include functionality to send generated PDF reports via email using `userService.postFormData` to `/send-client-report`. The final versions of both files include robust error handling and asynchronous operations for multiple API calls.  The changes likely involved improvements to the report generation process, perhaps adding error handling or optimizing performance.  There is also considerable use of promises and `async/await` to handle asynchronous calls, and `FormData` for sending the PDF via POST request.


## 5:19:14 PM
This commit to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` (6/26/2025, 4:25:05 PM) extensively modifies a React component for managing campaign outreach.  The component handles user interaction for scheduling and managing deliverables related to Instagram campaigns.

Key updates include:

* **Data Fetching and Management:**  The component makes multiple API calls using `userService` and `axios` to fetch content types, duration options, and Instagram attachments. Error handling and loading states (`isLoadingContentTypes`, `isLoadingDuration`, `isLoadingAttachments`, `isUploadingFiles`) are implemented throughout.  The component fetches attachments based on a `campaignId` prop.

* **User Interface:** It uses various UI components (Dropdown, DeliverableRow, EmailPreview, MailSent) to display and manage information. The UI includes features for selecting content type, duration, quantity of deliverables, and scheduling campaign execution with time constraints (15 minutes to 70 hours from now).  There is a mechanism to add and remove deliverables. File uploads are handled, with validation for allowed file types.

* **Campaign Logic:** The component validates user input (e.g., ensuring a campaign brief is provided and a duration is selected).  It checks email quota (`useEmailQuota`) and disables email-related buttons if insufficient credits exist. The logic for updating deliverables ensures that existing items are updated instead of creating duplicates.  The component saves uploaded attachments to the server using `SAVE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS` endpoint via `axios`.

* **State Management:**  The component uses `useState` hooks extensively to manage a wide range of application states, including content types, durations, deliverables, email preview status, and loading indicators.

* **API Interactions:**  The component interacts with several backend API endpoints (`GET_CATEGORIES_INSTAGRAM`, `GET_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS`, `GET_CATEGORY_BY_TYPES`, `SAVE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS`), primarily using `userService` (which likely wraps axios calls) and also directly with `axios`.  Authentication appears to use tokens from `tokenService`. The `api` service seems to have been replaced by `axios`.


The recurring theme is robust error handling and loading state management alongside extensive API integration to manage various aspects of an Instagram campaign outreach workflow.  The use of multiple `useEffect` hooks suggests asynchronous operations are crucial to the component's functionality.  The code shows a clear separation of concerns between UI, data fetching, and business logic.
