# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

## 12:32:02 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `OrderDetailsTab.jsx` between 11:32 PM and 11:40 PM on June 25th, 2025,  with seemingly no functional changes in the code.  The commented-out code remains largely consistent across these revisions, suggesting a possible debugging or experimentation phase.  There's a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling and Lucide React icons for visual elements.  The code displays order details, customer information, requirements, and images.  A key function, `handleStatusUpdate`, allows updating order status via a PUT request to an API endpoint.  The  `OrderGraphicsDetails.jsx` file is updated at 11:43 PM on June 25th, adding image search functionality using an API (`IMAGE_SEARCH_API`).  The search results are displayed with similarity scores and categorized by color-coded similarity percentages.  Finally, `OrderFilesTab.jsx` is modified twice between 11:50 PM and 11:52 PM on June 25th, with no apparent functional changes in the code between these revisions. The component allows for downloading order files (CAD, images, text) individually or as a zip archive. The last file, `ImageSearch.jsx`, modified at 12:01 AM on June 26th, 2025, deals with image uploading, database addition, and search functionalities.  It uses pagination and sorting features and shows error and success messages.


## 10:19:13 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` between 9:26 AM and 9:57 AM on June 26, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged across all revisions; all the timestamps represent minor edits, likely saving or auto-formatting. There are no discernible patterns or recurring content changes beyond the consistent structure of the React component.  The component uses several React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), interacts with a `userService` for fetching data (`GET_CATEGORY_BY_TYPES`), and renders a UI with dropdowns (`DropdownComponent`), tables, and icons.  The code suggests a UI for managing campaign outreach, allowing users to select content type, duration, and quantity, likely for social media campaigns.


## 11:19:12 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two React components: `CampaignOutreach.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`.  The changes span approximately an hour on June 26th, 2025.

`CampaignOutreach.jsx` primarily involves modifications to its file upload functionality.  Early versions used a custom approach to handle the `Content-Type` header in API requests for file uploads, attempting to delete it. Later versions (around 10:49:44 AM and 11:06:26 AM) reverted this and correctly set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data` when using `userService.post` for saving Instagram attachments. There are also minor UI adjustments, such as the styling of a table and the addition of margin (`mt-1`) to a div.  The component consistently uses `userService` and `api` for API interactions, fetching data based on a `campaignId` and handling user notifications.


`Shortlist.jsx` underwent updates focusing on user interface elements and filtering logic. The component fetches shortlisted creator data using `userService.post` with `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA` endpoint.  It incorporates search, verification status, and contact information filtering of creators.  The select-all functionality was improved by ensuring only creators with emails are selected in the 10:48:59 AM update. The UI is enhanced with tooltips and visual feedback for selected creators. There is no change in the core functionality of retrieving and displaying creator data.
