# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

## 12:32:02 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `OrderDetailsTab.jsx` between 11:32 PM and 11:40 PM on June 25th, 2025,  with seemingly no functional changes in the code.  The commented-out code remains largely consistent across these revisions, suggesting a possible debugging or experimentation phase.  There's a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling and Lucide React icons for visual elements.  The code displays order details, customer information, requirements, and images.  A key function, `handleStatusUpdate`, allows updating order status via a PUT request to an API endpoint.  The  `OrderGraphicsDetails.jsx` file is updated at 11:43 PM on June 25th, adding image search functionality using an API (`IMAGE_SEARCH_API`).  The search results are displayed with similarity scores and categorized by color-coded similarity percentages.  Finally, `OrderFilesTab.jsx` is modified twice between 11:50 PM and 11:52 PM on June 25th, with no apparent functional changes in the code between these revisions. The component allows for downloading order files (CAD, images, text) individually or as a zip archive. The last file, `ImageSearch.jsx`, modified at 12:01 AM on June 26th, 2025, deals with image uploading, database addition, and search functionalities.  It uses pagination and sorting features and shows error and success messages.


## 10:19:13 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` between 9:26 AM and 9:57 AM on June 26, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged across all revisions; all the timestamps represent minor edits, likely saving or auto-formatting. There are no discernible patterns or recurring content changes beyond the consistent structure of the React component.  The component uses several React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), interacts with a `userService` for fetching data (`GET_CATEGORY_BY_TYPES`), and renders a UI with dropdowns (`DropdownComponent`), tables, and icons.  The code suggests a UI for managing campaign outreach, allowing users to select content type, duration, and quantity, likely for social media campaigns.


## 11:19:12 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two React components: `CampaignOutreach.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`.  The changes span approximately an hour on June 26th, 2025.

`CampaignOutreach.jsx` primarily involves modifications to its file upload functionality.  Early versions used a custom approach to handle the `Content-Type` header in API requests for file uploads, attempting to delete it. Later versions (around 10:49:44 AM and 11:06:26 AM) reverted this and correctly set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data` when using `userService.post` for saving Instagram attachments. There are also minor UI adjustments, such as the styling of a table and the addition of margin (`mt-1`) to a div.  The component consistently uses `userService` and `api` for API interactions, fetching data based on a `campaignId` and handling user notifications.


`Shortlist.jsx` underwent updates focusing on user interface elements and filtering logic. The component fetches shortlisted creator data using `userService.post` with `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA` endpoint.  It incorporates search, verification status, and contact information filtering of creators.  The select-all functionality was improved by ensuring only creators with emails are selected in the 10:48:59 AM update. The UI is enhanced with tooltips and visual feedback for selected creators. There is no change in the core functionality of retrieving and displaying creator data.


## 12:19:28 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx`, a React component likely involved in managing campaign outreach.  The key changes revolve around file uploads, email quota checks, and handling of influencer data.

Initially, the component fetched existing attachments using `userService`, and duration options based on content type using `userService.get`.  It also included a `saveAttachmentsToAPI` function using both `userService.post` and `api.post` for saving attachments.  There's a significant change around  `11:27:10 AM` where `api.post` is removed and `axios.post` is introduced for handling API requests. This suggests a switch to a different HTTP client library or a simplification of the API interaction. Further changes around  `11:35:52 AM`  remove the `userService.post` call, leaving only `axios.post`,  further consolidating the API interaction method.  The `SAVE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS` constant is consistently used for attachment uploads.


Around `11:45:51 AM`, the code starts incorporating email quota checks using a custom hook `useEmailQuota`.  This hook provides information about quota limits, remaining quota, etc., enabling real-time checks on available credits.  The initial implementation checks against a `listBreak` variable, but this is replaced around `11:55:00 AM` with a check against the number of `influencers`. The logic for determining the influencer count is also refined to accommodate different data structures, showing a better handling of varying input formats.


The `CampaignOutreach` component's props are updated to include an `influencers` array around `11:55:00 AM`, and a `getInfluencerCount` helper function is added to handle various influencer data structures. The final version of the component (as of `12:19:04 PM`) efficiently handles email quota checks based on the number of influencers received as props.  A `hideEmailButtons` state variable is also added to control button visibility based on the quota, indicating additional UI/UX refinements.  The component continuously fetches attachments based on the `campId` via `useEffect` ensuring up-to-date information.  Throughout the edits, error handling with `showNotification` and logging using `console.log` and `console.error` remains consistent.

The `EmailPreview.jsx` component, which appears to be related to `CampaignOutreach.jsx`, was updated at `11:57:51 AM` and `12:00:28 PM`. This component generates an email preview based on received data (`attachedImages`, `campaignBrief`, `deliverables`), allowing for content editing and attachment removal. The main functionality is the generation of the full email content by dynamically constructing a markdown-like representation of the email, showing the intended email content.  The changes mostly consist of improvements to how the email content is generated and displayed for users.


## 1:19:16 PM
The provided log shows multiple edits to `CampaignOutreach.jsx` between 12:19 PM and 12:30 PM on June 26th, 2025, and a single edit to `Shortlist.jsx` at 12:55 PM and 1:00 PM on the same day.  The changes in `CampaignOutreach.jsx` primarily involved refining the file's functionality and not adding new features.  There's a consistent focus on handling file uploads, specifically implementing input validation for file types and sizes (allowing only JPG, PNG, and PDF files up to 5MB), and using `axios` with authentication (`tokenService.getLocalAccessToken()`) to send form data to the `SAVE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS` API endpoint. Several commented-out sections of code suggest experimentation with different API call methods (`userService.post` vs. `axios.post` vs. `api.post`).  The final change adds date and time limits for scheduling.

The edits to `Shortlist.jsx` introduced a table displaying creator data retrieved via `userService.post(GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA, payload)` and `userService.get(`${GET_DRAFT_DATA}/${campaignId}`)`, along with filtering and sorting capabilities based on search terms, verification status, and contact information presence.  A significant change was the addition of a validation check in the `handleEngageButtonClick` function to ensure at least one creator is selected before proceeding.  The update also improved UI elements like adding tooltips.


## 2:19:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `Shortlist.jsx` and `CampaignOutreach.jsx`.  Both underwent significant changes throughout the day on June 26th, 2025.

**`Shortlist.jsx` (6/26/2025, 1:26:32 PM):** This component displays a shortlist of creators. The main update involves creating a searchable and filterable table of creators.  Filtering is implemented for search terms, verified status, and the presence of contact information (prioritizing creators with both email and phone).  The table includes checkboxes for creator selection, enabling bulk actions. The component also fetches data using `userService.post(GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA, payload)` and `userService.get(`${GET_DRAFT_DATA}/${campaignId}`)`, indicating interaction with an API.  Loading and error states are also handled.

**`CampaignOutreach.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component handles campaign outreach.  There are multiple revisions demonstrating iterative development. Key features added include:

* **Attachment Handling:** The component fetches existing attachments via `userService.get(`${GET_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS}/${campId}`)`, allows users to upload new attachments (JPG, PNG, PDF, max 5 files, 5MB each) using `axios.post(SAVE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENTS, formData)`,  and displays them.  Error handling and notification are included.
* **Email Quota Check:** The component integrates with a `useEmailQuota` hook to check and display the remaining email quota, preventing actions if insufficient credits are available.  A warning message is shown ("You have insufficient email credits...").
* **Scheduling:** A feature was added to allow scheduling, limiting selectable dates/times between 15 minutes and 70 hours from the current time.  Initially, `alert` was used for error handling in date/time selection, later replaced with the `showNotification` function for consistency.
* **Deliverables:** Functionality to add and manage campaign deliverables was developed, allowing selection of content type (Reels, Story, Post) and duration.  The `GET_CATEGORY_BY_TYPES` API call is used to fetch duration options based on content type.

The repeated use of `userService`, `showNotification`, and consistent error handling demonstrates a focus on API interaction and user feedback. The numerous revisions suggest an iterative development process with frequent bug fixes and feature additions to the `CampaignOutreach` component.  The `axios` library was added to handle the upload of attachments.
