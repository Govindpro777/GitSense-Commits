# Activity Summary for 6/28/2025

## 5:44:12 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Navbar.jsx` between 5:35 PM and 5:43 PM on June 28, 2025.  Initially, the `Navbar.jsx` file was entirely commented out.  Over the next few minutes, it was gradually uncommented and expanded. The final version of the `Navbar.jsx` file is a React component that renders a navigation bar with features including a sidebar toggle, user profile dropdown (showing user's name, email and logout button), and a notification dropdown (displaying notifications and a link to view all).  The component handles various state changes, including the visibility of dropdowns and mobile menu, and incorporates click-outside functionality to close dropdowns.  There is also a mobile-specific menu implementation.  The repeated commenting out and uncommenting of the entire file suggests an iterative development process.  The `Sidebar.jsx` file was updated at 5:26 PM on the same day and contains a React component representing a sidebar navigation menu. It's structured to provide different menu options (`superadmin`, `admin`, `teacher`, `student`, `sales`) based on user roles, using nested children for submenus and icons from `lucide-react` and `react-icons/pi`.  Many menu items are commented out in the code, indicating potential future features or placeholders.
