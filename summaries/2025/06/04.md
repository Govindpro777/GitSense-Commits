# Activity Summary for 6/4/2025

The log shows multiple revisions to React component files within a tutoring platform's frontend.  The primary focus is on `Reasons.js`, which displays reasons to choose the platform and a "getting started" guide.

`Reasons.js` underwent significant changes between 11:37:06 AM and 11:46:22 AM.  The initial versions (11:37:06 AM and 11:38:05 AM) were almost identical, rendering a section with four reasons to choose the platform using `ReasonCard` components,  tutor testimonials using a `Testimonials` component, and a three-step getting started guide using `StepCard` components and a Swiper for smaller screens. The code heavily utilizes responsive design techniques with conditional rendering for different screen sizes.  Images are sourced from the `/landing-page` directory.

The final revision at 11:46:22 AM is a complete replacement. While structurally similar, it seems to correct a path issue within `imgSrc` values of `reasons` array. Instead of relative paths starting with `./`,  the paths now start with `/`. This suggests a path correction to use absolute paths.


`ReviewList.js` (updated at 11:37:53 AM) is a simpler component, rendering a hero section (`Hero`), tutor ratings (`Rating`), a tutor profile (`TutorProfile`), and the `ReasonsToChoose` component. This file showcases a functional component using `useSelector` for state management (likely from Redux).  This component shows less iterative changes.  No significant functional changes were made to this component.
