# Activity Summary for 6/29/2025

## 12:52:28 AM
The log shows iterative development of a React component (`create2.jsx`) between 11:52 PM on June 28th, 2025 and 12:11 AM on June 29th, 2025.  The component renders a form section.

Initially, the component was a simple layout with styled text indicating navigation steps ("Create", "Discover", "Shortlist", "Engage").  Over the next hour, several changes were made:

* **11:52 PM - 11:54 PM:**  The styling of a background div was refined. The border-radius was increased from 8px to 20px, and a light grey border was added.  A margin was added below the navigation text.

* **11:55 PM - 11:56 PM:** A heading "Letâ€™s get started! Tell us about your Campaign" was introduced and its styling (color and size) adjusted.

* **12:02 AM - 12:11 AM:** A two-column grid was added to the component, intended for form inputs.  Initially, this grid was empty.  Then, input labels ("Give your campaign a title*") and finally input fields (text and date) were introduced. The styling of the input fields (`<input>`) progressed through several iterations, ultimately including background color, border, padding, and rounded corners.  There was a brief period where two date input fields were present, which was later corrected to one. The styling and layout of the grid and input labels were also adjusted, particularly spacing between elements.  The overall focus of this stage was creating form fields.


The `create2.jsx` file was the sole file modified during this period.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is evident throughout all code changes.
