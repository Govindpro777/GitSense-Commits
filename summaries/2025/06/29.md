# Activity Summary for 6/29/2025

## 12:52:28 AM
The log shows iterative development of a React component (`create2.jsx`) between 11:52 PM on June 28th, 2025 and 12:11 AM on June 29th, 2025.  The component renders a form section.

Initially, the component was a simple layout with styled text indicating navigation steps ("Create", "Discover", "Shortlist", "Engage").  Over the next hour, several changes were made:

* **11:52 PM - 11:54 PM:**  The styling of a background div was refined. The border-radius was increased from 8px to 20px, and a light grey border was added.  A margin was added below the navigation text.

* **11:55 PM - 11:56 PM:** A heading "Let’s get started! Tell us about your Campaign" was introduced and its styling (color and size) adjusted.

* **12:02 AM - 12:11 AM:** A two-column grid was added to the component, intended for form inputs.  Initially, this grid was empty.  Then, input labels ("Give your campaign a title*") and finally input fields (text and date) were introduced. The styling of the input fields (`<input>`) progressed through several iterations, ultimately including background color, border, padding, and rounded corners.  There was a brief period where two date input fields were present, which was later corrected to one. The styling and layout of the grid and input labels were also adjusted, particularly spacing between elements.  The overall focus of this stage was creating form fields.


The `create2.jsx` file was the sole file modified during this period.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is evident throughout all code changes.


## 1:02:52 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `create2.jsx` between 12:57 AM and 12:30 PM on June 29th, 2025.  The file is a React component that appears to be a form for creating a social media campaign.

The initial versions (12:57 AM) included input fields for campaign title and two (redundant) date fields.  Subsequent edits between 12:57 AM and 1:01 AM added and removed input fields for "Breif" and "Budget," showing an iterative design process.  The placement and number of "Budget" fields changed multiple times.

A more significant revision occurred around 12:15 PM.  This update involved adding input fields for "Brand Name" and "Brand Goals," and  replacing the redundant date fields with a single date input.  The `grid-cols-2` structure was also refined using the `gap-4` utility class.

Further edits between 12:24 PM and 12:30 PM focused on improving the "Briefly describe the Campaign" section.  Initially, a simple `<textarea>` was added.  This was then styled, given a `name` attribute ("description"), a placeholder, a character limit (`maxLength={300}`), and finally enhanced with character count feedback (showing characters used out of 300).  The styling of this textarea also evolved from simpler to more detailed  CSS classes.  The final version at 12:30 PM shows a commented-out `<textarea>`.  The changes between 12:29 PM and 12:30 PM suggest the removal of the `<textarea>` element while keeping the character counter, potentially indicating a planned replacement with a different component.  The overall change pattern demonstrates a refinement of the form's layout and functionality, adding more fields and improving the user interface elements.


## 2:02:50 PM
The log shows three revisions of `Create.jsx`, a React component for creating social media campaigns.  The UI remains consistent across all revisions, featuring a form for campaign details (title, budget, brand name, goals, description, start and end dates).  The core functionality—submitting the form to `/social/discover-influencers` via `userService.post(SOCIAL_CAMPAIGN_CREATION, payload)`—also remains unchanged.

The key differences lie in a single function: `handleInput`.

* **Revision 1 (1:19:36 PM):** `handleInput` is a placeholder function (`handelInput = (e) => { }`).

* **Revision 2 (1:43:31 PM):** `handleInput` is updated to destructure `name` and `value` from the event object, but the `setFormData` call is incomplete (empty parenthesis `setFormData(())`).

* **Revision 3 (1:55:45 PM):** `handleInput` is corrected.  It now correctly updates the `formData` state using the spread syntax (`setFormData((prev) =>({ ...prev, [name]:value, })) `). This suggests a bug fix.


The other functions (`handleInputChange`, `handleButtonClick`) and the overall structure of the component remain unchanged throughout the log.  All revisions use local storage (`localStorage.getItem("userInfo")`) to retrieve user information. The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is also notable.
