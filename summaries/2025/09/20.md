# Activity Summary for 9/20/2025

## 10:00:24 AM
The log shows several code changes across different files within a backend system, likely for a mental health platform.

The most significant changes are in `authService.js` (9/20/2025, 12:23:49 AM), which handles user authentication and registration.  This file underwent a substantial revision of the `verifyEmailOTP` function. The original version was commented out, and a new version was added.  The key difference is that the new version creates a user account immediately after email and contact verification, even for users under 18.  It also adds a temporary token (`tempToken`) to the user document for users under 18, presumably for a later parent consent process.  The `register` function was also updated to include generating `tempToken` for pending user accounts. The `login` function now includes checks for email and contact verification, and parent consent for users under 18.


`psychologistRoutes.js` (multiple timestamps between 12:47:20 AM and 12:49:11 AM) shows modifications to the API routes for managing psychologists.  These changes appear minor and iterative, mostly focusing on refinements and likely bug fixes rather than major feature additions or structural changes. The only notable change is the addition of `User` model in  `psychologistRoutes.js` (9/20/2025, 12:47:59 AM)  This suggests a possible connection between user and psychologist models, possibly for reviews or appointments.


The `User.js` model (multiple timestamps between 12:48:13 AM and 12:49:20 AM) file has several minor updates over a short period. The most important change involves adding a `tempToken` field to the User schema. This field is marked as `sparse: true`, meaning it will only be populated if it has a value, improving database efficiency. The addition of `psychologist` to the `role` enum suggests functionality to manage psychologist accounts was added.  The earlier commented-out schema suggests refactoring of the existing schema.


`openapi.yaml` (multiple timestamps between 12:51:17 AM and 12:53:30 AM) shows minor modifications to the API documentation file, possibly reflecting updates made to the other files. These changes are too minor to pinpoint specific functionality or changes, but they indicate a continuous update of documentation to match code updates.

In summary, the major update was to the authentication service, enabling a more streamlined user registration and account creation process, with special considerations for users under 18.  The `psychologistRoutes` and `User` model updates suggest further development relating to psychologist profiles and user-psychologist interactions.  The `openapi.yaml` changes simply reflect the other file modifications.
