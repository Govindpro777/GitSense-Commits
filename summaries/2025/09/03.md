# Activity Summary for 9/3/2025

## 10:47:52 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `GetFiltersData.jsx` between 10:15 AM and 10:36 AM on September 3, 2025.  The component handles fetching and displaying filter data, likely for a user interface.

The primary changes revolve around the `filterApi` function, which retrieves filter data using the `userService`.  Initially,  it contained commented-out code for GET requests and only handled POST requests and a specific "preDefineData" URL for follower counts.  Over time, the commented-out GET request handling was reactivated, and the code was simplified to consistently handle API responses, transforming the data into a consistent `{ id, value, count }` format.  The transformation was added and subsequently removed between revisions, suggesting experimentation with data structure.  Finally, a version using the raw response data was adopted in the last commit.

Another recurring theme is the handling of `selectedFilters`. The `handleCheckboxChange` and `handleCheckboxChangeFor` functions update this state, exhibiting similar logic for updating filter selections, with minor differences possibly reflecting adjustments for specific filter types ("Followers" is handled uniquely).  The commented-out code in  `handleCheckboxChange` shows earlier iterations of the logic, indicating a refining process of this function.

There are no significant structural changes to the component's overall architecture. The modifications focused primarily on improving the data fetching and processing within the `filterApi` function and streamlining the filter selection update logic.  The final commit at 10:36:55 AM appears to be the most stable version.
