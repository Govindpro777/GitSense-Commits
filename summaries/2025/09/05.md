# Activity Summary for 9/5/2025

## 9:44:13 AM
The log shows several commits to the `kidmantree` project.  Initially, three simple React components (`Support`, `Report`, and `Finance`) were created between 9:29 AM and 9:30 AM on September 5th, 2025.  Each component rendered a simple `<div>` with its page name.

At 9:44 AM on the same day, the `Finance.jsx` component underwent a significant revision.  This update transformed it from a basic component to a more complex one that fetches and displays financial transaction data.  The changes include:

*   **Data Fetching and State Management:** The revised component uses `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`, and `useCallback` hooks to fetch transaction and user data using mock API calls (`api.getTransactions`, `api.getUsers`).  It manages states for loading status, search filter, date filter, current page, and display visibility.

*   **Data Filtering and Pagination:** It implements client-side filtering of transactions based on user/psychologist names and date range, as well as pagination using a custom `Pagination` component.

*   **UI Enhancements:** A more sophisticated UI was introduced with headers, filters (search and date range), a table to display paginated transactions, loading indicators, and error handling for no transactions found.  React icons (`react-icons/fi`, `react-icons/lu`) are used.  Styling appears to be handled using Tailwind CSS-like classes.

The key pattern is the evolution of the `Finance.jsx` component from a placeholder to a fully functional financial overview page.  The other components (`Support` and `Report`) remain basic placeholders.
