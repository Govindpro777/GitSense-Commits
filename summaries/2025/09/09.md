# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 10:01:31 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Manmitar\kidmantree\src\Layouts\Sidebar.jsx` on September 9th, 2025.  The file is a React component representing a sidebar.

Initially (9:11:23 AM), the sidebar included navigation items (`allNavItems`) tailored to different user roles ("superadmin" and "psychologist"), a notification panel (`NotificationPanel`) displaying unread notifications, settings, and logout functionality.  The navigation items used React Router's `NavLink` for routing and displayed icons from `react-icons/fa`. The notification panel was a separate component that could be toggled open and closed.

Subsequent commits (9:12:49 AM, 9:14:00 AM, 9:14:21 AM, 9:14:59 AM, 9:15:08 AM, and 9:15:25 AM) repeatedly commented out the entire component's code before uncommenting it again with minimal to no actual code changes. This suggests a possible issue with the IDE or version control, where the entire file was repeatedly commented and uncommented without intentional changes to the logic.  A final commit at 9:26:28 AM shows the code is essentially unchanged from the initial commit except for the removal of a duplicated "Mood Journal" entry in the `superadmin` navigation and the addition of a "Post Management" entry in the `superadmin` navigation.  Therefore, the most significant change is the addition of the "Post Management" navigation item.

The log shows updates to three files across a short time period on September 9th, 2025.

`PostManagement.jsx` (10:24:47 AM): This file contains React components for managing posts and categories.  It includes features for adding, editing, deleting, and toggling the active status of posts and categories. The code uses functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo), and React Icons.  It implements a form for creating/editing posts and categories, showing significant UI work within the component.

`App.jsx` (10:25:06 AM): This file defines the React Router configuration for the application.  It sets up routes for both public (login, forgot password) and protected pages (dashboard, user management, category management, etc.). A `ProtectedRoute` component is implemented to control access based on user roles (`superadmin` and `psychologist`), redirecting users to appropriate dashboards if unauthorized.  The routing extensively covers different sections of the application, suggesting a large and complex application.

`Sidebar.jsx` (11:52:56 AM): This component was initially commented out, suggesting it was initially removed or inactive. Then it was uncommented and updated to include a sidebar navigation menu. The navigation structure is role-based, dynamically rendering different menu items for `superadmin` and `psychologist` users. The menu items include links to the various application pages, clearly aligning to the routing defined in `App.jsx`.  The addition of this component suggests a significant UI change adding a functional sidebar.
