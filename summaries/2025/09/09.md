# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 10:01:31 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Manmitar\kidmantree\src\Layouts\Sidebar.jsx` on September 9th, 2025.  The file is a React component representing a sidebar.

Initially (9:11:23 AM), the sidebar included navigation items (`allNavItems`) tailored to different user roles ("superadmin" and "psychologist"), a notification panel (`NotificationPanel`) displaying unread notifications, settings, and logout functionality.  The navigation items used React Router's `NavLink` for routing and displayed icons from `react-icons/fa`. The notification panel was a separate component that could be toggled open and closed.

Subsequent commits (9:12:49 AM, 9:14:00 AM, 9:14:21 AM, 9:14:59 AM, 9:15:08 AM, and 9:15:25 AM) repeatedly commented out the entire component's code before uncommenting it again with minimal to no actual code changes. This suggests a possible issue with the IDE or version control, where the entire file was repeatedly commented and uncommented without intentional changes to the logic.  A final commit at 9:26:28 AM shows the code is essentially unchanged from the initial commit except for the removal of a duplicated "Mood Journal" entry in the `superadmin` navigation and the addition of a "Post Management" entry in the `superadmin` navigation.  Therefore, the most significant change is the addition of the "Post Management" navigation item.
