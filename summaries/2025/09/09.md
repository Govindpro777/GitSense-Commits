# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 10:01:31 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Manmitar\kidmantree\src\Layouts\Sidebar.jsx` on September 9th, 2025.  The file is a React component representing a sidebar.

Initially (9:11:23 AM), the sidebar included navigation items (`allNavItems`) tailored to different user roles ("superadmin" and "psychologist"), a notification panel (`NotificationPanel`) displaying unread notifications, settings, and logout functionality.  The navigation items used React Router's `NavLink` for routing and displayed icons from `react-icons/fa`. The notification panel was a separate component that could be toggled open and closed.

Subsequent commits (9:12:49 AM, 9:14:00 AM, 9:14:21 AM, 9:14:59 AM, 9:15:08 AM, and 9:15:25 AM) repeatedly commented out the entire component's code before uncommenting it again with minimal to no actual code changes. This suggests a possible issue with the IDE or version control, where the entire file was repeatedly commented and uncommented without intentional changes to the logic.  A final commit at 9:26:28 AM shows the code is essentially unchanged from the initial commit except for the removal of a duplicated "Mood Journal" entry in the `superadmin` navigation and the addition of a "Post Management" entry in the `superadmin` navigation.  Therefore, the most significant change is the addition of the "Post Management" navigation item.


## 1:01:31 PM
The log shows updates to three files across a short time period on September 9th, 2025.

`PostManagement.jsx` (10:24:47 AM): This file contains React components for managing posts and categories.  It includes features for adding, editing, deleting, and toggling the active status of posts and categories. The code uses functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo), and React Icons.  It implements a form for creating/editing posts and categories, showing significant UI work within the component.

`App.jsx` (10:25:06 AM): This file defines the React Router configuration for the application.  It sets up routes for both public (login, forgot password) and protected pages (dashboard, user management, category management, etc.). A `ProtectedRoute` component is implemented to control access based on user roles (`superadmin` and `psychologist`), redirecting users to appropriate dashboards if unauthorized.  The routing extensively covers different sections of the application, suggesting a large and complex application.

`Sidebar.jsx` (11:52:56 AM): This component was initially commented out, suggesting it was initially removed or inactive. Then it was uncommented and updated to include a sidebar navigation menu. The navigation structure is role-based, dynamically rendering different menu items for `superadmin` and `psychologist` users. The menu items include links to the various application pages, clearly aligning to the routing defined in `App.jsx`.  The addition of this component suggests a significant UI change adding a functional sidebar.


## 1:01:35 PM
The log shows several code modifications across two primary files: `BrandDashboard.jsx` and `ChartStats.jsx`.  There were also multiple edits to `MainContainer.jsx`.

**`BrandDashboard.jsx` (9/9/2025, 12:28:21 PM and 9/9/2025, 12:28:53 PM):** These two entries represent minor updates to `BrandDashboard.jsx`.  The changes primarily involve UI adjustments, likely for improved layout and responsiveness.  No core functionality changes are apparent between these two commits. The  second commit only appears to change some styling in the article section.

**`ChartStats.jsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This file underwent significant revisions. Initially, the code was fully commented out.  Subsequent changes introduced functionality to fetch and display chart data based on start and end dates.  The charts included are:  Media-wise coverage (City), Language-wise coverage, Share of voice, and Sentiment Score.  The data is fetched using `userService.post` with API endpoints defined by constants (`BRANDSENTIMENT`, `SHAREVOICE`, `BRANDLANGUAGE`, `CITYWISECOUNT`).  Multiple iterations focused on layout improvements, responsiveness (adjusting grid structure for different screen sizes) and minor styling changes within the charts' presentation.  There's a clear pattern of iterative refinement focused on the visual presentation and responsiveness of the charts. The final version uses a grid layout for better arrangement.

**`MainContainer.jsx` (Multiple Timestamps):** This component's modifications centered around adjusting the styling and layout of the main content area relative to the sidebar. Specifically, the `className` property of the `<main>` element was repeatedly adjusted to change the margin on larger screens (`lg` and up) based on whether the sidebar is open or closed.  There's experimentation with different margin values (`lg:ml-[20px]`, `lg:ml-[64px]`, `lg:ml-[224px]`, `lg:ml-[80px]`). The final commit introduces a `getMainContentClasses` function to calculate the margin dynamically for improved responsiveness.  One commit completely commented out the file followed by the addition of responsive adjustments.

In summary, the code changes reflect a development process involving UI refinement, addition of data fetching and charting functionality, and addressing responsiveness issues.  The `ChartStats.jsx` file showcases iterative development of a data visualization component. The `MainContainer.jsx` file reflects efforts to improve the layout based on sidebar state.


## 2:01:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components related to a brand dashboard.  The `BrandDashboard.jsx` component, updated at 1:05:49 PM on September 9, 2025, is the main dashboard displaying brand data fetched using `userService.get(BRANDTRACKER)`.  It features date range selection (past 24 hours, last 3 days, last week, last month, last 6 months, custom), a brand configuration popup (`SetBrandPopup`), and displays data in `ChartStats` and `TopJournalist` components.  The initial render shows a "Get started" message if no brand data is available.

The `ChartStats.jsx` component undergoes significant changes throughout the log (multiple updates between 1:08:25 PM and 2:01:09 PM on September 9, 2025).  These revisions primarily involve adjustments to the layout (`grid` class modifications, altering `gap` values) and minor styling updates (adjusting padding, font sizes, and `columnWidth` within the chart components).  Initially, it fetched data for four charts (Media-wise, Language-wise, Share of voice, Sentiment Score) using `userService.post` calls to different endpoints defined in constants (`BRANDSENTIMENT`, `SHAREVOICE`, `BRANDLANGUAGE`, `CITYWISECOUNT`).  Later revisions involve commenting out or removing the "Media-wise coverage" and "Language-wise coverage" charts.

The `PieChart.jsx` component (updated between 1:20:16 PM and 1:42:57 PM on September 9, 2025) uses `react-apexcharts` to render treemap charts. The changes are primarily focused on fine-tuning the chart's responsiveness and appearance, primarily adjusting the width of the `svg.apexcharts-svg` element within the style tag to ensure proper rendering across different screen sizes.

The `LanguageChart.jsx` component (updated between 1:40:40 PM and 1:57:39 PM on September 9, 2025) displays a horizontal bar chart using `react-apexcharts`.  Multiple revisions focus on adjusting the `columnWidth` and overall styling, including label formatting and  the height of the chart itself.  Also, the y-axis styling is modified significantly in multiple revisions, changing the appearance of axis lines and tick marks.

The `ShareOfVoice.jsx` component (updated at 1:45:55 PM on September 9, 2025), utilizes `react-apexcharts` to render donut charts and is designed to display share of voice data.  This component shows improvements to responsiveness, legend styling (font family, color, spacing), and label formatting (adding percentages).

In summary, the code changes primarily concern UI refinements, layout adjustments, and styling improvements to the brand dashboard.  The core functionality of data fetching and chart rendering remains consistent, though the displayed charts are modified over time. The frequent updates to `ChartStats.jsx`, `PieChart.jsx`, and `LanguageChart.jsx` suggest iterative design and layout adjustments were a focus of the development process.


## 3:01:36 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `Choose.jsx` and `Header.jsx`,  between approximately 2:46 PM and 2:54 PM on September 9th, 2025.  There were no changes detected in the code of `Searchbar.jsx` file.

**`Choose.jsx`:** This file underwent two revisions within a short time frame (2:46:02 PM and 2:46:15 PM).  The changes appear minor and consist of no detectable differences in the code itself. The component renders a page allowing users to choose between two platforms ("Skribe" and "Socion"). It uses Next.js's `Link` component for navigation and fetches a temporary token (`tempToken`) using `userService.post(TRANSFERTOEKN)`.  The user interface uses tailwind CSS for styling.

**`Header.jsx`:** This file shows a series of revisions (2:46:23 PM, 2:46:43 PM, 2:47:46 PM, 2:48:12 PM, 2:48:33 PM, 2:48:59 PM, and 2:54:33 PM).  These revisions are primarily focused on adding or refining functionality rather than large structural changes.  The component renders a header with various features like user authentication (`applogout`),  a search bar (`Searchbar`), and an announcement strip (`stripAnnouncement`).  It also implements user role based feature using `tokenService.getLocalRole()`. The header uses several services (`userService`, `tokenService`, `auth.service`) for fetching data and managing user information, showing frequent use of `useEffect` hooks for asynchronous operations and handling events.  Significant API calls are made to `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `ACTIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT`, and `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAYS` endpoints.  There's also a commented-out section that appears to be related to Google Analytics tracking. The final revision at 2:54:33 PM doesn't show any changes in code as compared to previous revision.

The recurring pattern in both files is the use of several services (`userService`, `tokenService`, `auth.service`) and the frequent usage of `useEffect` hooks to manage asynchronous operations, handle side effects, and update component state.  `TRANSFERTOEKN` is a constant used across both files, suggesting a connection related to token transfer between platforms. The  `Header.jsx` file also shows extensive use of local storage (`localStorage`) for storing user information.


## 4:01:46 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions to the `Searchbar.jsx` component and a single revision to the `Header.jsx` component between 3:02 PM and 3:07 PM on September 9, 2025.  The `AdvanceSearch.jsx` component was updated at 3:26 PM on the same day.


**Searchbar.jsx (Multiple Revisions):**

The primary focus of the `Searchbar.jsx` updates appears to be refinements to the search functionality and the display of city/outlet suggestions.  Changes across revisions include adjustments to the search bar's maximum width (`max-w` class) in the UI,  likely to improve responsiveness on different screen sizes.  The code consistently uses a debounce technique (using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`) for the city/outlet suggestions to prevent excessive API calls.  The handling of user roles ("Freebies") and conditional rendering based on the user's role in the suggestion list is also consistently present.  A significant change was the refactoring of the `changeUrl` function to handle routing based on whether a mediaArray is provided or not, better managing the redirection after selecting an outlet or city.

**Header.jsx:**

The `Header.jsx` component was updated to include functionality for tracking user activity (`postTracking` function) and fetching active announcements (`stripAnnouncement` function).  These functions make calls to the backend using `userService` for handling user information and announcements.  There is also the addition of offline/online status tracking and conditional rendering for a "Go To Socion" button based on login status.  The version control history doesn't show any significant structural changes.

**AdvanceSearch.jsx:**

This component received a single update at 3:26 PM.  The update focuses on improving the advanced search functionality.  Specific changes include the addition of tabs for "People", "Articles", and "Media Outlets," each with its own search functionality and type selection.  The component also dynamically fetches and displays recent and popular searches based on the selected tab. Error handling is included using `useNotification` to alert the user if they enter fewer than 3 characters in the search bar.


## 5:01:30 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ArticleCard.jsx` between 4:14 PM and 4:50 PM on September 9, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, which displays article cards, remains unchanged.  The primary modifications focus on the rendering of the article's author information.

Initially, the author's name was rendered with a `Link` component creating a clickable link to a journalist profile (if `intJid` was available), but later revisions involved commenting out this `Link` component, then replacing it with a conditional rendering. The conditional rendering shows the author's name with a link to their profile if `intJid` is available and a plain text version otherwise.  This change happened around 4:35 PM and was finalized by 4:50 PM.  Several intermediate commits show the transition from the original link implementation to the final conditional rendering.  Throughout this process, other parts of the code remained untouched, such as the date formatting, sentiment display, and topic button.  The commented-out code consistently suggests the intention to potentially re-enable the original linking functionality or add the highlighting functionality back in the future.


## 6:01:30 PM
On September 9th, 2025, at 5:23:09 PM, the `Sidebar.jsx` component was updated.  The update involved significant changes to the UI and functionality of a sidebar navigation component.  The component now includes:

* **Dynamic Navigation:** The sidebar displays navigation items based on the user's role (retrieved from `localStorage`).  Different roles (`superadmin` and `psychologist`) have different menu options, each with associated icons and routes.

* **Notification Panel:** A notification panel was added, showing unread and read notifications with details like text and timestamp.  The panel is toggleable via a button in the sidebar.  The notifications are hardcoded for now.

* **Styling Updates:** Extensive styling using Tailwind CSS was implemented to create a visually appealing sidebar with hover effects, animations (transitions), and a gradient background.  Tooltips are used to display labels upon hovering over the icons.

* **User Authentication:**  The component interacts with `localStorage` to retrieve and remove user information, handling user logout functionality.

The code uses React, React Router, and React Icons.  The overall pattern is a well-structured functional component with clear separation of concerns and consistent styling.  The use of functional components, hooks (useState), and the dynamic navigation based on user role are notable features.
