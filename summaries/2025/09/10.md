# Activity Summary for 9/10/2025

## 3:40:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Manmitar\kidmantree\src\Layouts\Sidebar.jsx` between 10:37 PM and 10:40 PM on September 9, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the styling and dimensions of the sidebar's navigation items, specifically the buttons and links.

Initially, nav items had a size of `w-12 h-12`.  Subsequent revisions repeatedly adjusted this size, finally settling on `w-10 h-10`  in the last commit.  These modifications suggest an iterative process of refining the UI layout of the sidebar. No functional changes were made to the code's logic. The `NotificationPanel` component remained unchanged throughout the revision process.
