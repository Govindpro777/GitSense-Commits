# Activity Summary for 9/10/2025

## 3:40:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Manmitar\kidmantree\src\Layouts\Sidebar.jsx` between 10:37 PM and 10:40 PM on September 9, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the styling and dimensions of the sidebar's navigation items, specifically the buttons and links.

Initially, nav items had a size of `w-12 h-12`.  Subsequent revisions repeatedly adjusted this size, finally settling on `w-10 h-10`  in the last commit.  These modifications suggest an iterative process of refining the UI layout of the sidebar. No functional changes were made to the code's logic. The `NotificationPanel` component remained unchanged throughout the revision process.


## 9:59:00 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `ArticleCard.jsx` and `Header.jsx`,  along with `Searchbar.jsx`.  The changes span a short period between 9:12 AM and 9:30 AM on September 10th, 2025.

**`ArticleCard.jsx`**:  The primary change in `ArticleCard.jsx` involves modifications to the rendering of the author's information. Initially, there was a `<Link>` component rendering the author's name and a link to their profile if available.  Subsequent revisions removed the `<Link>` component entirely and simply rendered the author's name as a plain `<span>` element in one version and reinstated the `<Link>` component but with conditional rendering based on `intJid` in another version. The commented-out `highlightText` function suggests potential work on search result highlighting within the card.  The date formatting of `item?.dtmPublishDate` also changes from using `toLocaleDateString("en-GB")` to a custom reverse date formatting.

**`Header.jsx`**: The `Header.jsx` file undergoes several revisions but the code remains largely the same, focusing on various aspects of user interface elements within the Header component.  No significant structural changes are apparent.  The numerous `useEffect` hooks handle tasks like fetching a transfer token, checking online status, retrieving freebie expiry days, user role detection, and tracking user activity with numerous API calls to `userService`.  A commented-out section suggests the presence of Google Analytics tracking code in previous versions.

**`Searchbar.jsx`**:  The `Searchbar.jsx` file undergoes several revisions, primarily adjusting the width of the search input field (`xl:w-[...]`). The initial version has `xl:w-[280px]`, then `xl:w-[270px]`, then `xl:w-[240px]`, `xl:w-[280px]`,  and finally `xl:w-[140px]`,  suggesting adjustments for responsiveness and layout. There's also a significant amount of commented-out code related to disabling the search input field depending on the current route.  The core functionality related to search, media dropdown, and city suggestion remains consistent, utilizing `userService` calls for data fetching (e.g., `geoCity` function).  The addition of conditional rendering for "Regional" results based on `roleType` shows further changes to this component.


The overall pattern is iterative refinement, focusing primarily on UI adjustments and enhancing user experience with progressive refinement of  component behaviour and visual aspects within the Header and Search bar. There's a clear reliance on `userService` and `tokenService` for API interactions, user data retrieval, and authentication status checks.
