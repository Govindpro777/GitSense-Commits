# Activity Summary for 9/14/2025

## 4:35:06 PM
The log shows a single code change on September 14, 2025, at 4:01:22 PM.  This modification to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Backend2\swagger.js` involved setting up Swagger documentation for an API. The code uses the `swagger-autogen` library to generate a Swagger JSON file (`swagger-output.json`) based on routes defined in `./src/routes/userRoutes.js`. The API is described as "My API" and hosted at `localhost:4000`, with a base path of `/api/v1`.  The key action is the generation of API documentation, indicating potential work on API specification and design.


## 5:35:10 PM
The log shows development of a backend API, focusing on changes to the server and swagger documentation.

**`server.js`**:  The primary changes in `server.js` involve integrating Swagger UI for API documentation. Initially, the server started but lacked Swagger integration.  Around 4:59 PM, `/api-docs` was added to serve the swagger documentation. At 5:15 PM, the Swagger UI configuration was enhanced, adding options for explorer, custom CSS, site title, and favicon.  The core server functionality (database connection, port listening, graceful shutdown) remained consistent throughout the log.

**`swagger.js`**: This file underwent significant revisions related to the API documentation generation. Initially (5:02 PM), it contained basic information; subsequently, more detailed metadata was added, including OpenAPI specification version (`3.0.3`), schema definitions for User, ApiResponse, and ErrorResponse, security definitions (BearerAuth using JWT), server URLs for development and production, and comprehensive tags for various API sections (Auth, Users, Posts, Moods, Feelings, Psychologists, Appointments, Analytics, Chatbot, Content, Questionnaires).  There were multiple, nearly identical commits between 5:03 PM and 5:13 PM, suggesting iterative refinements to the documentation structure.

**`package.json`**: This file was updated at 5:05 PM to reflect the addition of various dependencies required for the project, including those related to Swagger UI,  database interaction (Mongoose), authentication (JWT, bcrypt), validation (Joi, express-validator), and logging (Winston).  This indicates a comprehensive set of libraries used in the backend.

**`authRoutes.js`**:  This file, containing API routes for authentication, was updated at 5:15 PM and 5:16 PM. The changes primarily affected the Swagger documentation for several endpoints (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/parent/init`), adding more robust error handling documentation (400 responses with ErrorResponse schema).  The underlying route structure and functionality seem to remain unchanged, only the documentation improving.

The timestamps indicate a focused period of development, with the majority of changes happening between 4:58 PM and 5:16 PM on September 14, 2025.  The iterative commits to `swagger.js` suggest a process of refining and improving the API documentation.  The overall pattern demonstrates the development of a robust and well-documented RESTful API for a mental health platform.
