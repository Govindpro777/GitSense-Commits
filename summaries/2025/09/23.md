# Activity Summary for 9/23/2025

## 12:12:07 PM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `ForgotPassword.jsx` and `ChangePassword.jsx`.

**ForgotPassword.jsx:**  Between 11:41:01 AM and 11:42:10 AM, this component underwent several revisions.  Initially, the code was heavily commented out, suggesting a process of simplification or refactoring.  The most significant change involved removing the dependency on Redux (`react-redux`) and replacing alert boxes with more comprehensive error handling. The code now directly uses `userService` for API calls related to password reset, and  handling different API responses (Ok, FreebiesExpire, NotExist).  Alert messages are used to communicate the API responses to the user.

**ChangePassword.jsx:** This component was modified multiple times between 11:59:23 AM and 12:09:17 PM. The key changes involve:

* **HTTP Client Change:** The initial version used a custom `userService` for API calls, but this was subsequently replaced with `axios`. This switch likely improves flexibility and offers more detailed error handling.
* **Authentication:**  The implementation consistently uses  `tokenService.getLocalAccessToken()` to obtain an access token for authorized API requests via the `Authorization` header.
* **Error Handling:**  Thorough error handling using `useNotification` is implemented, displaying detailed error messages to the user based on the backend API response and improving user experience. The error messages clearly indicate problems with the old password, new password length, password mismatch, and the password not meeting complexity requirements. A `console.log(errori)` statement was added at one point to aid debugging and then removed.  The `console.log(output)` statement remains for debugging the API response.
* **Minor UI Tweaks:** A minor typo in the description  ("speci Charactor" changed to "special Charactor") was corrected in one of the revisions.


In general, the updates show a trend towards streamlining the codebase by removing dependencies and improving error handling and clarity. The use of `axios` suggests a move towards a more modern and widely-used HTTP client library.  The consistent use of structured error handling from the API greatly enhances the user experience.
