# Activity Summary for 9/23/2025

## 12:12:07 PM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `ForgotPassword.jsx` and `ChangePassword.jsx`.

**ForgotPassword.jsx:**  Between 11:41:01 AM and 11:42:10 AM, this component underwent several revisions.  Initially, the code was heavily commented out, suggesting a process of simplification or refactoring.  The most significant change involved removing the dependency on Redux (`react-redux`) and replacing alert boxes with more comprehensive error handling. The code now directly uses `userService` for API calls related to password reset, and  handling different API responses (Ok, FreebiesExpire, NotExist).  Alert messages are used to communicate the API responses to the user.

**ChangePassword.jsx:** This component was modified multiple times between 11:59:23 AM and 12:09:17 PM. The key changes involve:

* **HTTP Client Change:** The initial version used a custom `userService` for API calls, but this was subsequently replaced with `axios`. This switch likely improves flexibility and offers more detailed error handling.
* **Authentication:**  The implementation consistently uses  `tokenService.getLocalAccessToken()` to obtain an access token for authorized API requests via the `Authorization` header.
* **Error Handling:**  Thorough error handling using `useNotification` is implemented, displaying detailed error messages to the user based on the backend API response and improving user experience. The error messages clearly indicate problems with the old password, new password length, password mismatch, and the password not meeting complexity requirements. A `console.log(errori)` statement was added at one point to aid debugging and then removed.  The `console.log(output)` statement remains for debugging the API response.
* **Minor UI Tweaks:** A minor typo in the description  ("speci Charactor" changed to "special Charactor") was corrected in one of the revisions.


In general, the updates show a trend towards streamlining the codebase by removing dependencies and improving error handling and clarity. The use of `axios` suggests a move towards a more modern and widely-used HTTP client library.  The consistent use of structured error handling from the API greatly enhances the user experience.

The log shows edits to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\ExpertBuddy\app\layout.tsx`.  The file is a React component rendering a webpage layout including a navbar, main content area, and footer.  Google Analytics tracking code is incorporated using `next/script`.

The first two edits (11:16:18 AM and 11:16:31 AM) are nearly identical. The only difference is the explicit import of `Script` from `next/script` in the second version.  The third edit (11:17:23 AM) modifies the Google Analytics tracking ID from `G-L6REHKD7DC` to `G-675TFNVQER` in both `<Script>` tags.  This suggests a change in the Google Analytics property being used for tracking.  The rest of the component's structure remains consistent across all revisions.


## 1:12:06 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `ForgotPassword.jsx` and `ChangePassword.jsx`.

**`ForgotPassword.jsx`**: This component underwent several revisions between 12:28 PM and 12:40 PM on September 23, 2025.  Initially, the component was fully functional, utilizing a number of external modules including `react-redux`, various toast notification components, and Redux actions.  These dependencies and the associated Redux logic were subsequently commented out in multiple revisions, simplifying the component to use only basic alert messages for feedback.  The core functionality of sending a password reset token remained, using a `userService` call to the backend. The final version removed all commented-out code.

**`ChangePassword.jsx`**:  This component has two entries, both around 12:37 PM and 12:38 PM on September 23, 2025.  The changes are minor.  The component handles password changes using a custom hook `useNotification` for displaying success or warning messages. The initial revision lacked a specific warning message for identical old and new passwords; this was added in the second revision.  Similar to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, Redux integration appears to be removed or commented out in favor of direct API calls using `userService`.  The error handling improved, providing more specific warning messages based on backend error responses.  The only significant change was a more descriptive warning message ("Current and new password are same kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!") replacing a shorter one.


A common pattern across both components is the removal of Redux integration and the simplification of error/success handling using direct alert messages and a custom notification hook instead of Redux-based toast notifications.  This suggests a refactoring effort to reduce complexity or to switch from Redux to a different state management solution.
