# Activity Summary for 9/19/2025

## 12:27:21 AM
The `AddJournalist.tsx` file, last updated on 9/18/2025 at 10:40:27 PM, is a React component for adding journalist data.  It uses Formik for form handling, Yup for validation, and various React-Select components for dropdown selections.  The component makes extensive use of asynchronous API calls to `userService` for fetching and updating data related to outlets, beats, sub-beats, cities, states, and other journalist attributes.

Significant updates involve managing numerous state variables for different aspects of journalist information, including `outletMediaList`, `blogGenre`, `primaryBeat`, `secondaryBeat`, `title`, `supplement`, `outletshows`, contact details, social media links, career summaries, and call status.  The component dynamically updates options in select boxes based on user selections (e.g., state selection triggers city updates, outlet selection updates media type options).  It also includes components for adding titles, supplements, and shows, managed through modals.

Error handling is present, but generally limited to console logging.  A debounce function is implemented for API calls to prevent excessive requests during input changes.  The validation schema, though truncated in the provided code snippet, indicates required fields and custom validation rules. The component uses SweetAlert2 for alerts and utilizes several custom components (`Alert`, `CustomAlert`, `ModalComponent`).  The code's extensive use of state variables and API calls suggests a complex form with substantial data management.

The provided code represents a React component (`AddJournalist`) for adding journalist information.  Multiple updates occurred between 9:33 AM and 9:46 AM on September 19, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on managing form data for journalist details.

The primary change appears to be in the `loadOptions` and `handleInputChange` functions related to outlet selection.  Initially, `loadOptions` fetched outlet suggestions without considering already selected options, potentially leading to duplicates.  The later revisions updated `loadOptions` and `handleInputChange` to accept and use an `excludedValues` array, effectively preventing the selection of duplicate outlets.  This improvement enhances the user experience and data integrity.  No other significant functional changes are apparent between the provided timestamps. The component extensively uses React hooks for state management, including numerous state variables to manage various aspects of journalist data such as  `beat`, `state`, `city`, `supplement`, `outletshows`, `title`, and `language`.  It also interacts with backend services (`userService`) for data fetching and posting.  The component includes Modal components for adding supplements, titles and shows.
