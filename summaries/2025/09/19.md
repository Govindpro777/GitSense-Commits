# Activity Summary for 9/19/2025

## 12:27:21 AM
The `AddJournalist.tsx` file, last updated on 9/18/2025 at 10:40:27 PM, is a React component for adding journalist data.  It uses Formik for form handling, Yup for validation, and various React-Select components for dropdown selections.  The component makes extensive use of asynchronous API calls to `userService` for fetching and updating data related to outlets, beats, sub-beats, cities, states, and other journalist attributes.

Significant updates involve managing numerous state variables for different aspects of journalist information, including `outletMediaList`, `blogGenre`, `primaryBeat`, `secondaryBeat`, `title`, `supplement`, `outletshows`, contact details, social media links, career summaries, and call status.  The component dynamically updates options in select boxes based on user selections (e.g., state selection triggers city updates, outlet selection updates media type options).  It also includes components for adding titles, supplements, and shows, managed through modals.

Error handling is present, but generally limited to console logging.  A debounce function is implemented for API calls to prevent excessive requests during input changes.  The validation schema, though truncated in the provided code snippet, indicates required fields and custom validation rules. The component uses SweetAlert2 for alerts and utilizes several custom components (`Alert`, `CustomAlert`, `ModalComponent`).  The code's extensive use of state variables and API calls suggests a complex form with substantial data management.


## 10:20:02 AM
The provided code represents a React component (`AddJournalist`) for adding journalist information.  Multiple updates occurred between 9:33 AM and 9:46 AM on September 19, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on managing form data for journalist details.

The primary change appears to be in the `loadOptions` and `handleInputChange` functions related to outlet selection.  Initially, `loadOptions` fetched outlet suggestions without considering already selected options, potentially leading to duplicates.  The later revisions updated `loadOptions` and `handleInputChange` to accept and use an `excludedValues` array, effectively preventing the selection of duplicate outlets.  This improvement enhances the user experience and data integrity.  No other significant functional changes are apparent between the provided timestamps. The component extensively uses React hooks for state management, including numerous state variables to manage various aspects of journalist data such as  `beat`, `state`, `city`, `supplement`, `outletshows`, `title`, and `language`.  It also interacts with backend services (`userService`) for data fetching and posting.  The component includes Modal components for adding supplements, titles and shows.


## 11:20:04 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `ViewBlog.tsx` and `AddBlog.tsx`, with one update to `config.ts`.  The changes span approximately 20 minutes on September 19th, 2025.

`ViewBlog.tsx` underwent two minor revisions.  The first change (10:57:39 AM and 10:58:45 AM) improved the `toggleStatus` function. Initially, it only took the blog ID. The updated version also accepts the blog's `isActive` and `isFeatured` statuses, adding logic to unfeature a blog if it's deactivated and previously featured.  This addition ensures data consistency.

`AddBlog.tsx` was modified three times (11:18:56 AM, 11:19:01 AM, and 11:19:49 AM) with the most significant change happening in the last revision.  These updates primarily focused on the image handling and the addition of  `getImageURL` from `config.ts` to properly set the image preview URL, resolving a potential bug by using the image base URL set in the `config.ts` file.  The `AddBlog.tsx` file also includes a form for adding or updating blog posts; the `useEffect` hook fetches existing blog data if `blogId` is provided in the URL parameters, loading it into the form. The addition of a modal component for adding new categories is also observed. This addition improves the user experience by enabling the creation of new categories directly within the blog creation form.

`config.ts`  was updated at 11:16:30 AM. This update modified the `baseURL` and `imageURL` values for different environments (development, preview, production). Notably, the current code sets different environments to use the same dev environment URL.  The functions `getBaseURL` and `getImageURL`  dynamically return the base URL and image URL based on the environment.  The function `isProduction` is also used to check the current build environment.


## 12:45:18 PM
The log shows updates to two files: `openapi.yaml` and `User.js`.

The `openapi.yaml` file, modified at 11:46:40 AM on September 19th, 2025, appears to be an OpenAPI specification file defining the API for a mental health platform.  It details various API endpoints, including user authentication (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, etc.), and data models for users, posts, mood logs, psychologists, appointments, and polls.  The specification includes detailed descriptions of request bodies, responses, and data schemas.  The API likely supports user registration, login, OTP verification, and various other functionalities related to mental health management.

The `User.js` file, updated at 12:06:46 PM on September 19th, 2025, is a Mongoose schema defining the `User` model. The key change is the addition of a `tempToken` field (of type String) to the schema,  likely used for temporary tokens in the authentication process, and it includes a sparse index to improve efficiency of tempToken lookups.   Additionally, the `role` enum now includes  `'psychlogist'` indicating a new user role has been added.  The rest of the schema remains largely unchanged, defining fields such as `name`, `email`, `password`, `contact`, `age`, verification statuses, and relationships to other models (`ParentConsent`, `NotificationPrefs`).


## 1:20:12 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `AddBlog.tsx` and `AddJournalist.tsx`, along with several revisions to `BlogDetails.tsx`.  The changes span a period from 11:20 AM to 1:14 PM on September 19, 2025.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Blog\AddBlog.tsx`:**

This file underwent several minor revisions between 11:20 AM and 11:26 AM. The primary change was in how blog images are handled.  The URL for retrieving blog images was adjusted in the `imagePreview` section to include "/BlogImage"  to correctly form the image path, correcting an apparent error in the image URL construction within the `getImageURL()` function.  No other functional changes were made to this component.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Blog\BlogDetails.tsx`:**

This file also underwent minor revisions between 11:24 AM and 11:26 AM.  These changes focused on the styling of the displayed blog image, specifically adjusting the `max-h` CSS property to control the maximum height of the image to prevent excessively large images from disrupting the layout. The value was changed from `400px` to `500px` and then remained at `500px`.  Additionally, the `/BlogImage`  path was corrected by adding a forward slash before the image URL to properly construct the image path. The `getBaseURL` import was removed at 11:26 AM, suggesting this function was no longer needed.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Journalist\AddJournalist.tsx`:**

This file saw significant changes from 11:39 AM to 12:30 PM.  The component is a form for adding journalist information, using Formik and Yup for validation.  The main updates involved refining the handling of asynchronous data loading and updates, notably in the `onOutletChange` function. There were multiple additions to the code indicating work on improving the handling of outlet selections, triggering related data fetches (supplements, broadcast information), and updating the component's state based on user interactions.  The `loadOptions` function was modified to incorporate `excludedValues` for improved handling of already selected values.  The numerous incremental updates suggest iterative debugging and feature refinement within this form component.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Journalist\EditJournalist.tsx`:**

This file, similar to `AddJournalist.tsx`, also underwent numerous revisions between 11:49 AM and 1:14 PM.  It's an edit form for journalist data, sharing much of the structure and functionality with `AddJournalist.tsx`.  The changes reflect similar patterns: improvements to the asynchronous data fetching, particularly around outlet media types (`onOutletChange`) and state/city selection (`onStateChange`).  These changes frequently involved adding error handling and refining the way formik's `setFieldValue` is used to update the form's state.   The extensive revisions indicate significant work on improving data handling, error prevention, and user experience within this complex form.  The frequent commits also show a possibly iterative debugging process.


## 2:20:03 PM
The log shows modifications to `EditJournalist.tsx`, a React component likely for editing journalist profiles.  The changes span approximately 1 minute (2:04 PM to 2:05 PM).

The key updates focus on handling asynchronous data loading and improving the user interface.

**Key Changes:**

* **9/19/2025, 2:04:08 PM:**  The initial commit shows a substantial component with extensive state management (`useState` hooks for various data like `beat`, `city`, `state`, `masterLookUps`, etc.) and functionality to handle adding supplements, titles, and shows to the journalist profile.  Importantly, it features a `loadOptions` function for asynchronous outlet search using `userService.get`, initially without handling already selected values.  City fetching based on state selection (`onStateChange`) is present but incomplete at this stage.

* **9/19/2025, 2:04:17 PM:**  The `loadOptions` function is enhanced to accept `excludedValues` to prevent adding duplicate outlets. The `handleInputChange` function is updated to use this parameter. A new `onOutletChange` function is added to fetch and update `mediaOptionsList` based on the selected `outletId`, improving the user experience by dynamically updating media options.

* **9/19/2025, 2:05:43 PM:** The `onStateChange` function, which handles updating city options based on state selection, is completed, incorporating error handling and filtering to only show valid city IDs.


**Recurring Elements:**

* Extensive use of `useState` hooks for managing component state.
* Frequent use of `userService.get` and `userService.post` for fetching data from a backend service.
* The consistent use of `SelectOption` interface for dropdown options.
* A pattern of adding new components dynamically (`SupplementComponent`, `Title`, `Shows`).


The overall pattern suggests iterative development, with each commit addressing specific functionalities and improving the data handling and user experience within the journalist profile editing component.  The changes primarily focus on making the interface more dynamic and responsive by correctly handling dependencies between different data selections.


## 4:09:17 PM
The log shows three consecutive updates to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\server\models\User.js`, all within a short time frame (between 3:12:13 PM and 3:12:30 PM on September 19, 2025).  The changes are minor and appear to be related to refactoring or version control operations, as the code remains largely identical in each revision. The only substantive difference lies in the removal of the `address` field from the User schema between the first and third commits.  There's no other significant pattern or recurring change beyond these minor adjustments to the User model definition within the Mongoose schema.


## 8:53:04 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a frontend and backend application.

The `PropertySaleCertificateForm.jsx` component underwent several revisions between 5:14 PM and 5:15 PM on September 19, 2025.  These changes appear to involve only minor edits and formatting within the file, as the code remains largely unchanged in its commented-out state throughout all the commits. The code represents a form with numerous fields related to property sale certificate information, including bank details, property details, legal information and agreement details. It uses Formik for form management, Yup for validation, and React components for the UI.  There are also commented out sections containing data for auto-population of the form.


The `userController.js` file shows the addition of a user controller class with methods for user registration, email verification (including OTP sending and verification), and login functionality, at 5:52 PM on September 19, 2025.  It uses bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for token generation, and a custom function for setting cookies to store authentication tokens.  The code includes robust error handling and logging.


The `page.jsx` file for user login (`/account/user-login`) was modified multiple times between 5:59 PM and 6:01 PM on September 19, 2025. These changes primarily focus on improving the handling of successful login responses, storing access and refresh tokens, user role and user information in the browser's local storage upon successful login.


The `Navbar.jsx` component was modified multiple times  between 6:15 PM and 6:22 PM on September 19, 2025.  The component displays a navigation bar, with sections for navigation links, user authentication (login/signup options for both users and agents, and logout). There is also an area that displays a loading indicator while authentication status is being checked. The final commit at 6:22 PM shows the component entirely commented out.


The `page.jsx` file for Will Deed (`/will-deed`) experienced substantial changes between 6:23 PM and 6:28 PM on September 19, 2025. Initially, it appeared to be a form for creating will deeds, heavily reliant on JavaScript functions for dynamic form interactions. Later versions show a transformation into a React component that fetches, displays, and manages will deed data from a backend API. The changes include the addition of functionality for fetching will deed statistics, viewing individual will deeds, updating their status, and deleting them.  These operations utilize `fetch` requests to interact with a backend API at the endpoint `/api/will-deed` including authentication checks in `headers`.


The `willDeedController.js` file contains controller methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting will deeds from a database. It includes detailed input sanitization using `DOMPurify` and comprehensive error handling and logging using a logger instance. A new method, `submit`, is added to handle the submission of the will deed form, including the processing of file uploads.  The modifications happened at 6:41 PM on September 19, 2025.  There is a pattern of using a logger object for tracking actions and errors throughout the controller.

In summary, the code changes reflect the development of a web application for creating and managing legal documents, including user authentication and administration features. The development process involved iteratively refining UI components, adding backend API endpoints and data models, and enhancing security.


## 10:40:06 PM
The log shows development of a MERN stack authentication application.  The `frontend` directory contains several updates to `package.json`, which remains unchanged in content throughout the logged edits, indicating possible repeated saves or failed attempts.  There are also multiple repeated edits to `index.js` file (with no code changes) between 9:33:08 PM and 9:34:49 PM.  At 9:33:17 PM, significant changes were made to `src/App.js`, introducing React components for login, signup, and a welcome screen, suggesting the implementation of authentication features.  The `backend` directory shows a `routes/auth.js` file which handles user signup and login routes, using JWT for authentication, created at 9:41:12 PM. The `.env` file in the frontend shows multiple attempts to set the `BASE_URL` environment variable, settling on `https://localhost:5000`.  The initial failed attempt (`index.html` not found) indicates a possible issue with the project setup, later resolved by configuring the `BASE_URL`.
