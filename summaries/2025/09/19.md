# Activity Summary for 9/19/2025

## 12:27:21 AM
The `AddJournalist.tsx` file, last updated on 9/18/2025 at 10:40:27 PM, is a React component for adding journalist data.  It uses Formik for form handling, Yup for validation, and various React-Select components for dropdown selections.  The component makes extensive use of asynchronous API calls to `userService` for fetching and updating data related to outlets, beats, sub-beats, cities, states, and other journalist attributes.

Significant updates involve managing numerous state variables for different aspects of journalist information, including `outletMediaList`, `blogGenre`, `primaryBeat`, `secondaryBeat`, `title`, `supplement`, `outletshows`, contact details, social media links, career summaries, and call status.  The component dynamically updates options in select boxes based on user selections (e.g., state selection triggers city updates, outlet selection updates media type options).  It also includes components for adding titles, supplements, and shows, managed through modals.

Error handling is present, but generally limited to console logging.  A debounce function is implemented for API calls to prevent excessive requests during input changes.  The validation schema, though truncated in the provided code snippet, indicates required fields and custom validation rules. The component uses SweetAlert2 for alerts and utilizes several custom components (`Alert`, `CustomAlert`, `ModalComponent`).  The code's extensive use of state variables and API calls suggests a complex form with substantial data management.

The provided code represents a React component (`AddJournalist`) for adding journalist information.  Multiple updates occurred between 9:33 AM and 9:46 AM on September 19, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on managing form data for journalist details.

The primary change appears to be in the `loadOptions` and `handleInputChange` functions related to outlet selection.  Initially, `loadOptions` fetched outlet suggestions without considering already selected options, potentially leading to duplicates.  The later revisions updated `loadOptions` and `handleInputChange` to accept and use an `excludedValues` array, effectively preventing the selection of duplicate outlets.  This improvement enhances the user experience and data integrity.  No other significant functional changes are apparent between the provided timestamps. The component extensively uses React hooks for state management, including numerous state variables to manage various aspects of journalist data such as  `beat`, `state`, `city`, `supplement`, `outletshows`, `title`, and `language`.  It also interacts with backend services (`userService`) for data fetching and posting.  The component includes Modal components for adding supplements, titles and shows.


## 11:20:04 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `ViewBlog.tsx` and `AddBlog.tsx`, with one update to `config.ts`.  The changes span approximately 20 minutes on September 19th, 2025.

`ViewBlog.tsx` underwent two minor revisions.  The first change (10:57:39 AM and 10:58:45 AM) improved the `toggleStatus` function. Initially, it only took the blog ID. The updated version also accepts the blog's `isActive` and `isFeatured` statuses, adding logic to unfeature a blog if it's deactivated and previously featured.  This addition ensures data consistency.

`AddBlog.tsx` was modified three times (11:18:56 AM, 11:19:01 AM, and 11:19:49 AM) with the most significant change happening in the last revision.  These updates primarily focused on the image handling and the addition of  `getImageURL` from `config.ts` to properly set the image preview URL, resolving a potential bug by using the image base URL set in the `config.ts` file.  The `AddBlog.tsx` file also includes a form for adding or updating blog posts; the `useEffect` hook fetches existing blog data if `blogId` is provided in the URL parameters, loading it into the form. The addition of a modal component for adding new categories is also observed. This addition improves the user experience by enabling the creation of new categories directly within the blog creation form.

`config.ts`  was updated at 11:16:30 AM. This update modified the `baseURL` and `imageURL` values for different environments (development, preview, production). Notably, the current code sets different environments to use the same dev environment URL.  The functions `getBaseURL` and `getImageURL`  dynamically return the base URL and image URL based on the environment.  The function `isProduction` is also used to check the current build environment.


## 12:45:18 PM
The log shows updates to two files: `openapi.yaml` and `User.js`.

The `openapi.yaml` file, modified at 11:46:40 AM on September 19th, 2025, appears to be an OpenAPI specification file defining the API for a mental health platform.  It details various API endpoints, including user authentication (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, etc.), and data models for users, posts, mood logs, psychologists, appointments, and polls.  The specification includes detailed descriptions of request bodies, responses, and data schemas.  The API likely supports user registration, login, OTP verification, and various other functionalities related to mental health management.

The `User.js` file, updated at 12:06:46 PM on September 19th, 2025, is a Mongoose schema defining the `User` model. The key change is the addition of a `tempToken` field (of type String) to the schema,  likely used for temporary tokens in the authentication process, and it includes a sparse index to improve efficiency of tempToken lookups.   Additionally, the `role` enum now includes  `'psychlogist'` indicating a new user role has been added.  The rest of the schema remains largely unchanged, defining fields such as `name`, `email`, `password`, `contact`, `age`, verification statuses, and relationships to other models (`ParentConsent`, `NotificationPrefs`).
