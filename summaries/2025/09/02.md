# Activity Summary for 9/2/2025

## 10:19:32 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `EditJournalist.tsx` between 9:19 AM and 9:25 AM on September 2nd, 2025.  The changes appear to be focused on refining the component's functionality, primarily involving asynchronous data fetching and handling of form data related to journalist profiles.  There are no substantive code changes between the revisions, only minor differences that are likely due to refactoring or formatting. The code consistently uses `userService` for API calls to fetch and update journalist information, including `outlet-search`, `/GetCitiesByStateIds`, and `/GetOutletMediaType`. A `debounce` function is implemented to manage asynchronous calls for outlet search.  The component heavily utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useDispatch`, `useParams`), Formik for form management, and React-Select for dropdown components.  The structure remains consistent across all revisions, indicating iterative improvements rather than a complete overhaul.  The commented-out `onOutletChange` function suggests a previous approach to handling outlet data that was later replaced or modified in the final version.  The file includes several interfaces defining data structures (`OutletMedia`, `FormValues`, `BeatItem`, `StateItem`, `CityItem`, `SelectOption`) for managing journalist information, suggesting a well-structured approach to data handling.
