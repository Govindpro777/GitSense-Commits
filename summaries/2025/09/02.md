# Activity Summary for 9/2/2025

## 10:19:32 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `EditJournalist.tsx` between 9:19 AM and 9:25 AM on September 2nd, 2025.  The changes appear to be focused on refining the component's functionality, primarily involving asynchronous data fetching and handling of form data related to journalist profiles.  There are no substantive code changes between the revisions, only minor differences that are likely due to refactoring or formatting. The code consistently uses `userService` for API calls to fetch and update journalist information, including `outlet-search`, `/GetCitiesByStateIds`, and `/GetOutletMediaType`. A `debounce` function is implemented to manage asynchronous calls for outlet search.  The component heavily utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useDispatch`, `useParams`), Formik for form management, and React-Select for dropdown components.  The structure remains consistent across all revisions, indicating iterative improvements rather than a complete overhaul.  The commented-out `onOutletChange` function suggests a previous approach to handling outlet data that was later replaced or modified in the final version.  The file includes several interfaces defining data structures (`OutletMedia`, `FormValues`, `BeatItem`, `StateItem`, `CityItem`, `SelectOption`) for managing journalist information, suggesting a well-structured approach to data handling.


## 11:19:33 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `EditJournalist.tsx` between 10:27 AM and 10:33 AM on September 2nd, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the component's functionality and removing commented-out code.  There is no discernible pattern in the code itself across these revisions beyond iterative refinement.

Specifically, a significant change occurs between 10:31:53 AM and 10:32:41 AM where a large block of commented-out code related to `onOutletChange` is removed. This suggests a refactoring effort where the functionality was likely implemented differently.  The `onOutletChange` function's implementation is changed across the edits but remains consistent after 10:32:41 AM. The file consistently uses React, Formik, and various react-select components to manage a form for editing journalist data.  Data fetching from a `/userService` is extensively used for populating dropdowns and handling state changes, particularly the `onStateChange` function for fetching cities based on selected state IDs.  The component manages a substantial amount of state related to different aspects of journalist information.  The additions of `SupplementComponent`, `Title`, and `Shows` components suggest a modular design for adding supplemental information to the journalist profiles.


## 1:13:26 PM
The log shows changes across several files in a backend system, primarily focused on user authentication and password reset functionality.

The `.env` file underwent multiple revisions between 12:17 PM and 12:53 PM on September 2nd, 2025,  primarily concerning email credentials.  The `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` values were modified several times, ultimately settling on `"test@webseeder.tech"` and `"Webseedertest@123"` respectively.  Other environment variables like `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, and the MongoDB connection string remained unchanged.

The `models/otp.js` file was modified twice within a short timeframe (12:48 PM and 12:49 PM).  The initial change removed the email sending functionality using `nodemailer`, replacing it with a simple console log of the OTP.  This change was quickly reverted.  The final version includes the email-sending functionality using nodemailer.

The `Controllers/superAdminController.js` file was updated at 1:02 PM. This update significantly altered the `superAdminLogin`, `sendForgotPasswordOtp`, and `verifyForgotPasswordOtp` functions. The changes involved improved error handling, removing commented-out code, and modifying how OTPs are handled;  instead of sending OTP via email, it logs the OTP to the console for testing purposes.

Finally, the `swagger-output.json` file was modified multiple times between 1:05 PM and 1:07 PM, reflecting additions and changes to API endpoints, but no substantial structural changes are evident.  The repeated updates suggest iterative refinements to the API documentation.  There appears to be endpoints for user and superadmin login, signup, password reset, and profile management, as well as  additional functionalities for managing user statuses and mental health responses.


## 2:13:26 PM
The log shows changes primarily focused on the `sendEmail.js` file within the `kidmantree-backend` project, reflecting adjustments to email sending functionality.  The `swagger-output.json` file, updated earlier (2:00:17 PM), details API endpoints for user signup, login, password reset, profile management, and dashboard access, along with those for handling user mental health responses and mood journaling.  These endpoints are categorized for superadmin and regular users.


The `sendEmail.js` file underwent multiple revisions between 2:00:46 PM and 2:07:38 PM.  Initially, it used Gmail as the email service. This was later changed to `smtp.hostinger.com` at 2:02:18 PM.  The change at 2:05:09 PM and 2:05:24 PM involved further refinements to the Hostinger SMTP configuration, specifying the port (465), security settings (`secure: true`), and handling potential certificate issues (`rejectUnauthorized: false`).   The final revision at 2:07:38 PM removed commented-out code, simplifying the file and explicitly setting the sender email address in `sendEmail` function to match the Hostinger email.  The  `sendOtpEmail` and `sendPsychologistRecommendationEmail` functions remained largely consistent throughout the updates,  primarily focusing on enhanced email formatting and clarity of the messaging. The email sending functions use a  templated HTML structure for improved readability and professionalism. The `sendPsychologistRecommendationEmail` function includes logic to send to both user and parent if the user is a minor.


The `.env` file update at 2:02:57 PM indicates a change of email credentials, moving away from a Gmail account ("hchanda2003@gmail.com") to a Hostinger account ("Prajapati.Govind@webseeder.tech").  This aligns with the changes observed in `sendEmail.js` where the email service was switched from Gmail to Hostinger's SMTP server.


## 3:13:25 PM
The log shows modifications to the `superAdminRoutes.js` and `superAdminController.js` files between 2:55 PM and 3:01 PM on September 2nd, 2025.

`superAdminRoutes.js` underwent several revisions focusing on the `/create` route for superadmin creation.  Initially,  `verifySuperAdmin` middleware was added to this route (2:55:59 PM), implying only existing superadmins could create new ones. However, this middleware was subsequently removed (2:57:44 PM and 3:01:10 PM), suggesting a change in requirements or access control strategy.  The other routes (`/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/profile`, `/dashboard`, and `/user/toggle-user-status/:id`) remained largely consistent throughout the log.

`superAdminController.js`  shows a complete replacement of commented-out code with a new implementation (2:58:36 PM and 2:58:55 PM). The commented-out code appears to be an older version of the controller's functionality. The new code includes a robust implementation of the `createSuperAdmin` function,  handling validation, password hashing using bcrypt, and returning a response without the password for security.  The `superAdminLogin`, `sendForgotPasswordOtp`, and `verifyForgotPasswordOtp` functions were also implemented in this version, providing the complete superadmin authentication and password reset flow.  Note that the `superAdminLogin` function includes hardcoded password comparison which should be removed in production environments.


## 4:19:31 PM
The file `ArticleInjestion.tsx` contains a React component for uploading and processing CSV files.  The component, `ArticleIngestion`, allows users to select a CSV file (only CSV files are accepted), upload it to a backend server (`https://beta.goskribe.com/API/v1/FileUpload`), and display the processing results.  The upload process uses `fetch` to send a POST request with `FormData`. Error handling is implemented to catch and display both backend and frontend errors.

The component displays a file selection input, a submit button (disabled while loading or no file is selected), a reset button, and a results section. The results section shows summary statistics (total records, inserted records, filename) and a table of the processed data.  The processed data includes columns from the uploaded CSV.  The timestamp of this code reflects a commit made on September 2nd, 2025 at 4:17:32 PM.  The component uses various React hooks (`useState`, `ChangeEvent`, `React.FormEvent`, `React.FC`) and includes custom styling.  The backend API response is parsed as a JSON object with fields like `status`, `filename`, `total_records`, `columns`, `inserted_records`, and an array of `ArticleData` objects, each containing `outlet`, `article_url`, and `brand` fields.  The UI provides visual feedback during loading and handles various error conditions with user-friendly messages.


## 5:19:33 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ArticleInjestion.tsx` between 4:20 PM and 4:37 PM on September 2nd, 2025, primarily focusing on the `handleSubmit` function which handles CSV file uploads.  The initial versions used `fetch` and the `userService.post` or `userService.postFormData` methods to send the file data to a backend endpoint (`/FileUpload`).  There was experimentation with the endpoint URL, initially attempting to use a hardcoded `pythonBaseUrl` ("https://beta.goskribe.com") and later seemingly relying on the `userService` to manage the base URL.  The commented-out `fetch` calls suggest a transition to using `axios` for making API requests which provides more robust error handling.

A significant change occurred around 4:25 PM, where the `handleSubmit` function was completely rewritten to use `axios` for making the API request.  This version includes an `Authorization` header with an access token retrieved from `localStorage` and a custom header "X-Source-App" set to "FrontendApp".  The error handling was also improved, providing more specific messages based on the structure of the axios error response.  Subsequent revisions further refined the error handling in the `handleSubmit` function, focusing on providing more informative error messages to the user based on the type of error encountered (403 Forbidden, backend error details, no server response, etc.). The final version at 4:37 PM reverted back to using `userService.postFormData` for simplicity instead of the `axios` implementation from 4:25 PM.

The `handleFileChange` function remained consistent throughout the revisions, performing basic CSV file validation.  No changes were made to the file's UI elements or presentation logic, only the backend communication methods were altered.  The `userService.ts` file was updated at 4:38 PM to include the `postFormData` method, which is likely used to send form data (including files) to the backend. This method consistently includes an `Authorization` header and other headers for proper backend interaction.


## 6:13:25 PM
The log shows modifications to two controller files within a Node.js backend application.

`superAdminController.js` underwent two revisions. The first revision (5:15:46 PM) contained commented-out code for super admin login, forgot password OTP sending, and OTP verification.  The second revision (5:32:33 PM) removed the commented-out code and added a `console.log` statement within the `superAdminLogin` function for debugging purposes.  This version also includes functional code for super admin creation, login, forgot password OTP, and password reset.  Significant changes involved replacing commented-out code with functional code, including bcrypt password hashing and JWT token generation for authentication. The `superAdminLogin` function was updated to include more robust input validation and logging.

`superadminDashboardController.js` (5:16:10 PM) contains a single revision.  This file defines a controller function (`getSuperAdminDashboard`) to retrieve various dashboard metrics.  These metrics include user counts, active psychologists, flagged content, new sign-ups, total and average session durations, revenue, positive feedback counts, support tickets, top mental health issues, and today's session schedule, showing a comprehensive overview of the platform's activity.  The data is fetched from multiple models (`User`, `Session`, `Report`, `Category`, `Psychologist`) using aggregation pipelines and other methods, and the results are formatted for the dashboard.


## 6:19:36 PM
The log shows a React component (`ArticleIngestion`) designed for CSV file uploads and processing.  The component undergoes significant revisions between 5:40 PM and 6:19 PM on September 2nd, 2025.

Initially, the component uses `userService` for API calls to a `/FileUpload` endpoint.  Error handling is implemented but lacks robustness.  The API response structure is then modified to include a more detailed `APIResponse` interface, separating the response status and message from the response body. This allows for more granular error handling. The `handleSubmit` function is heavily revised to handle this new API response structure, including explicit checks for "Ok" and "Error" statuses.  A helper function `parseErrorMessage` is added to improve error message parsing from the backend.  The error handling is improved to correctly display detailed error messages from the server.

Between 5:41 PM and 6:05 PM, the code is repeatedly commented out and then uncommented. This suggests a process of experimentation or debugging.  It does not show significant structural or functional changes during this period.

Finally at 6:19 PM, the API endpoint is changed from `/FileUpload` to `csv-to-array/pandas` and uses `fetch` directly instead of `userService`. This indicates a shift from potentially an internal user-service based API to a direct call to a backend server likely using Pandas for CSV processing, possibly a Python backend. The UI receives additions such as a section detailing CSV format requirements. The display of the upload results is improved by adding a record count, conditional display of an additional info section (showing the number of records that were not inserted), and truncating long URLs for better display within the table.  The Alert component's `success` method is replaced with the more appropriate `error` in error handling to enhance clarity.


The recurring pattern throughout the log is the iterative refinement of error handling and the API interaction logic.  The changes highlight a progression toward a more robust and user-friendly component.


## 9:19:36 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts` was updated on 9/2/2025 at 6:59:53 PM.  The update focuses on enhancing the Axios API client with robust token refresh functionality.  The code now includes interceptors to handle requests and responses.  On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response, it attempts to refresh the access token using a refresh token.  If the refresh fails, the user is redirected to the login page.  Error handling is improved, particularly for network errors and expired tokens.  The base URL for the API is configurable, with commented-out options for different environments (localhost, beta, and production). The Alert component is used for user feedback in case of errors.  The code utilizes `TokenService` for managing access and refresh tokens.  There is a mechanism to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh token requests.
