# Activity Summary for 9/2/2025

## 10:19:32 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `EditJournalist.tsx` between 9:19 AM and 9:25 AM on September 2nd, 2025.  The changes appear to be focused on refining the component's functionality, primarily involving asynchronous data fetching and handling of form data related to journalist profiles.  There are no substantive code changes between the revisions, only minor differences that are likely due to refactoring or formatting. The code consistently uses `userService` for API calls to fetch and update journalist information, including `outlet-search`, `/GetCitiesByStateIds`, and `/GetOutletMediaType`. A `debounce` function is implemented to manage asynchronous calls for outlet search.  The component heavily utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useDispatch`, `useParams`), Formik for form management, and React-Select for dropdown components.  The structure remains consistent across all revisions, indicating iterative improvements rather than a complete overhaul.  The commented-out `onOutletChange` function suggests a previous approach to handling outlet data that was later replaced or modified in the final version.  The file includes several interfaces defining data structures (`OutletMedia`, `FormValues`, `BeatItem`, `StateItem`, `CityItem`, `SelectOption`) for managing journalist information, suggesting a well-structured approach to data handling.


## 11:19:33 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `EditJournalist.tsx` between 10:27 AM and 10:33 AM on September 2nd, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the component's functionality and removing commented-out code.  There is no discernible pattern in the code itself across these revisions beyond iterative refinement.

Specifically, a significant change occurs between 10:31:53 AM and 10:32:41 AM where a large block of commented-out code related to `onOutletChange` is removed. This suggests a refactoring effort where the functionality was likely implemented differently.  The `onOutletChange` function's implementation is changed across the edits but remains consistent after 10:32:41 AM. The file consistently uses React, Formik, and various react-select components to manage a form for editing journalist data.  Data fetching from a `/userService` is extensively used for populating dropdowns and handling state changes, particularly the `onStateChange` function for fetching cities based on selected state IDs.  The component manages a substantial amount of state related to different aspects of journalist information.  The additions of `SupplementComponent`, `Title`, and `Shows` components suggest a modular design for adding supplemental information to the journalist profiles.
