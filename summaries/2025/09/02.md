# Activity Summary for 9/2/2025

## 10:19:32 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `EditJournalist.tsx` between 9:19 AM and 9:25 AM on September 2nd, 2025.  The changes appear to be focused on refining the component's functionality, primarily involving asynchronous data fetching and handling of form data related to journalist profiles.  There are no substantive code changes between the revisions, only minor differences that are likely due to refactoring or formatting. The code consistently uses `userService` for API calls to fetch and update journalist information, including `outlet-search`, `/GetCitiesByStateIds`, and `/GetOutletMediaType`. A `debounce` function is implemented to manage asynchronous calls for outlet search.  The component heavily utilizes React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useDispatch`, `useParams`), Formik for form management, and React-Select for dropdown components.  The structure remains consistent across all revisions, indicating iterative improvements rather than a complete overhaul.  The commented-out `onOutletChange` function suggests a previous approach to handling outlet data that was later replaced or modified in the final version.  The file includes several interfaces defining data structures (`OutletMedia`, `FormValues`, `BeatItem`, `StateItem`, `CityItem`, `SelectOption`) for managing journalist information, suggesting a well-structured approach to data handling.


## 11:19:33 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `EditJournalist.tsx` between 10:27 AM and 10:33 AM on September 2nd, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the component's functionality and removing commented-out code.  There is no discernible pattern in the code itself across these revisions beyond iterative refinement.

Specifically, a significant change occurs between 10:31:53 AM and 10:32:41 AM where a large block of commented-out code related to `onOutletChange` is removed. This suggests a refactoring effort where the functionality was likely implemented differently.  The `onOutletChange` function's implementation is changed across the edits but remains consistent after 10:32:41 AM. The file consistently uses React, Formik, and various react-select components to manage a form for editing journalist data.  Data fetching from a `/userService` is extensively used for populating dropdowns and handling state changes, particularly the `onStateChange` function for fetching cities based on selected state IDs.  The component manages a substantial amount of state related to different aspects of journalist information.  The additions of `SupplementComponent`, `Title`, and `Shows` components suggest a modular design for adding supplemental information to the journalist profiles.


## 1:13:26 PM
The log shows changes across several files in a backend system, primarily focused on user authentication and password reset functionality.

The `.env` file underwent multiple revisions between 12:17 PM and 12:53 PM on September 2nd, 2025,  primarily concerning email credentials.  The `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` values were modified several times, ultimately settling on `"test@webseeder.tech"` and `"Webseedertest@123"` respectively.  Other environment variables like `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, and the MongoDB connection string remained unchanged.

The `models/otp.js` file was modified twice within a short timeframe (12:48 PM and 12:49 PM).  The initial change removed the email sending functionality using `nodemailer`, replacing it with a simple console log of the OTP.  This change was quickly reverted.  The final version includes the email-sending functionality using nodemailer.

The `Controllers/superAdminController.js` file was updated at 1:02 PM. This update significantly altered the `superAdminLogin`, `sendForgotPasswordOtp`, and `verifyForgotPasswordOtp` functions. The changes involved improved error handling, removing commented-out code, and modifying how OTPs are handled;  instead of sending OTP via email, it logs the OTP to the console for testing purposes.

Finally, the `swagger-output.json` file was modified multiple times between 1:05 PM and 1:07 PM, reflecting additions and changes to API endpoints, but no substantial structural changes are evident.  The repeated updates suggest iterative refinements to the API documentation.  There appears to be endpoints for user and superadmin login, signup, password reset, and profile management, as well as  additional functionalities for managing user statuses and mental health responses.


## 2:13:26 PM
The log shows changes primarily focused on the `sendEmail.js` file within the `kidmantree-backend` project, reflecting adjustments to email sending functionality.  The `swagger-output.json` file, updated earlier (2:00:17 PM), details API endpoints for user signup, login, password reset, profile management, and dashboard access, along with those for handling user mental health responses and mood journaling.  These endpoints are categorized for superadmin and regular users.


The `sendEmail.js` file underwent multiple revisions between 2:00:46 PM and 2:07:38 PM.  Initially, it used Gmail as the email service. This was later changed to `smtp.hostinger.com` at 2:02:18 PM.  The change at 2:05:09 PM and 2:05:24 PM involved further refinements to the Hostinger SMTP configuration, specifying the port (465), security settings (`secure: true`), and handling potential certificate issues (`rejectUnauthorized: false`).   The final revision at 2:07:38 PM removed commented-out code, simplifying the file and explicitly setting the sender email address in `sendEmail` function to match the Hostinger email.  The  `sendOtpEmail` and `sendPsychologistRecommendationEmail` functions remained largely consistent throughout the updates,  primarily focusing on enhanced email formatting and clarity of the messaging. The email sending functions use a  templated HTML structure for improved readability and professionalism. The `sendPsychologistRecommendationEmail` function includes logic to send to both user and parent if the user is a minor.


The `.env` file update at 2:02:57 PM indicates a change of email credentials, moving away from a Gmail account ("hchanda2003@gmail.com") to a Hostinger account ("Prajapati.Govind@webseeder.tech").  This aligns with the changes observed in `sendEmail.js` where the email service was switched from Gmail to Hostinger's SMTP server.


## 3:13:25 PM
The log shows modifications to the `superAdminRoutes.js` and `superAdminController.js` files between 2:55 PM and 3:01 PM on September 2nd, 2025.

`superAdminRoutes.js` underwent several revisions focusing on the `/create` route for superadmin creation.  Initially,  `verifySuperAdmin` middleware was added to this route (2:55:59 PM), implying only existing superadmins could create new ones. However, this middleware was subsequently removed (2:57:44 PM and 3:01:10 PM), suggesting a change in requirements or access control strategy.  The other routes (`/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/profile`, `/dashboard`, and `/user/toggle-user-status/:id`) remained largely consistent throughout the log.

`superAdminController.js`  shows a complete replacement of commented-out code with a new implementation (2:58:36 PM and 2:58:55 PM). The commented-out code appears to be an older version of the controller's functionality. The new code includes a robust implementation of the `createSuperAdmin` function,  handling validation, password hashing using bcrypt, and returning a response without the password for security.  The `superAdminLogin`, `sendForgotPasswordOtp`, and `verifyForgotPasswordOtp` functions were also implemented in this version, providing the complete superadmin authentication and password reset flow.  Note that the `superAdminLogin` function includes hardcoded password comparison which should be removed in production environments.


## 4:19:31 PM
The file `ArticleInjestion.tsx` contains a React component for uploading and processing CSV files.  The component, `ArticleIngestion`, allows users to select a CSV file (only CSV files are accepted), upload it to a backend server (`https://beta.goskribe.com/API/v1/FileUpload`), and display the processing results.  The upload process uses `fetch` to send a POST request with `FormData`. Error handling is implemented to catch and display both backend and frontend errors.

The component displays a file selection input, a submit button (disabled while loading or no file is selected), a reset button, and a results section. The results section shows summary statistics (total records, inserted records, filename) and a table of the processed data.  The processed data includes columns from the uploaded CSV.  The timestamp of this code reflects a commit made on September 2nd, 2025 at 4:17:32 PM.  The component uses various React hooks (`useState`, `ChangeEvent`, `React.FormEvent`, `React.FC`) and includes custom styling.  The backend API response is parsed as a JSON object with fields like `status`, `filename`, `total_records`, `columns`, `inserted_records`, and an array of `ArticleData` objects, each containing `outlet`, `article_url`, and `brand` fields.  The UI provides visual feedback during loading and handles various error conditions with user-friendly messages.
