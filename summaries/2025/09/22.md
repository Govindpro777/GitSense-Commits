# Activity Summary for 9/22/2025

The log shows changes to server-side routing (`trustDeedRoutes.js`) and a frontend React component (`PropertyRegistrationForm.jsx`).

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\server\routes\trustDeedRoutes.js`**:  This file underwent two revisions within a short time frame (11:36:21 AM and 11:36:42 AM).  The key change was a significant refactoring of the route definitions. Initially, the routes were mostly commented out. The second revision implements authentication middleware (`passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false })`, `accessTokenAutoRefresh`, and `setAuthHeader`)  before all routes. The `multer` middleware for handling file uploads was also significantly modified to use `upload.fields(uploadFields)`  for specifying multiple file upload fields,  instead of `upload.any()`.  The commented-out authentication was removed from individual routes. A new route `/id/status` for updating status has been added.  The commented-out `initializePayment` route remains commented out.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\frontend\src\components\PropertyRegistrationForm.jsx`**: This file was updated multiple times between 11:39:10 AM and 11:42:50 AM. The component is a React form for property registration.  The changes primarily involved adding functionality for handling authentication and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Initially, there was only a form. The later revisions added functions `fetchAllRegistrations`, `fetchRegistrationById`, `handleDelete`, and `handleEdit` that interact with a backend API (`API_BASE`, which defaults to `http://localhost:4000`).  These functions now include `Authorization` headers with `Bearer` tokens retrieved from local storage. The form now displays success/error messages using `react-toastify`.  The `onSubmit` function sends POST requests to the backend, while the  `handleDelete` and `handleEdit` functions are for deleting and updating records (although the update appears to be a simplified status update).  The form itself is well-structured with validation using `formik` and `Yup`.
