# Activity Summary for 9/22/2025

## 12:34:55 PM
The log shows changes to server-side routing (`trustDeedRoutes.js`) and a frontend React component (`PropertyRegistrationForm.jsx`).

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\server\routes\trustDeedRoutes.js`**:  This file underwent two revisions within a short time frame (11:36:21 AM and 11:36:42 AM).  The key change was a significant refactoring of the route definitions. Initially, the routes were mostly commented out. The second revision implements authentication middleware (`passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false })`, `accessTokenAutoRefresh`, and `setAuthHeader`)  before all routes. The `multer` middleware for handling file uploads was also significantly modified to use `upload.fields(uploadFields)`  for specifying multiple file upload fields,  instead of `upload.any()`.  The commented-out authentication was removed from individual routes. A new route `/id/status` for updating status has been added.  The commented-out `initializePayment` route remains commented out.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\frontend\src\components\PropertyRegistrationForm.jsx`**: This file was updated multiple times between 11:39:10 AM and 11:42:50 AM. The component is a React form for property registration.  The changes primarily involved adding functionality for handling authentication and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Initially, there was only a form. The later revisions added functions `fetchAllRegistrations`, `fetchRegistrationById`, `handleDelete`, and `handleEdit` that interact with a backend API (`API_BASE`, which defaults to `http://localhost:4000`).  These functions now include `Authorization` headers with `Bearer` tokens retrieved from local storage. The form now displays success/error messages using `react-toastify`.  The `onSubmit` function sends POST requests to the backend, while the  `handleDelete` and `handleEdit` functions are for deleting and updating records (although the update appears to be a simplified status update).  The form itself is well-structured with validation using `formik` and `Yup`.


## 1:34:53 PM
The log shows multiple updates to a React frontend component (`PropertyRegistrationForm.jsx`) and its corresponding backend server-side code.  The frontend component, updated three times between 12:40:36 PM and 12:48:29 PM on September 22nd, 2025,  is a form for property registration.  It uses Formik for form handling, Yup for validation, and React-toastify for displaying messages.  The form fetches and displays all property registrations, allows creating new registrations, deleting existing ones, and (in a rudimentary way) editing them. The form interacts with a backend API located at `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` or `http://localhost:4000`.  Authentication appears to be handled using tokens stored in local storage.  The frontend code is heavily commented and uses Hindi for labels and error messages.

The backend (`propertyRegistrationRoutes.js` and `propertyRegistrationController.js`) handles API requests related to property registrations.  The `propertyRegistrationRoutes.js` file was updated once at 12:46:45 PM on September 22nd, 2025.  This update significantly refactored the code:  previously, authentication middleware was conditionally applied; now, authentication (`passport.authenticate('userOrAgent', { session: false })`), access token refresh (`accessTokenAutoRefresh`), and setting of auth headers (`setAuthHeader`) are consistently applied to all routes.  The `propertyRegistrationController.js`, updated once at 12:48:03 PM,  contains functions for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and getting stats for property registrations.  It uses `DOMPurify` to sanitize inputs, preventing potential XSS vulnerabilities.  The update adds a new `updateStatus` route for updating the status of property registrations and handles various statuses (`draft`, `submitted`, `approved`, `rejected`).  Error handling and logging (`logger`) are implemented throughout the controller.  The controller also validates that required fields are present before processing create requests.


## 4:51:18 PM
The log shows several revisions to two HTML files, `mailer1.html` and `mailer2.html`,  between 3:52 PM and 4:32 PM on September 22nd, 2025.

**mailer1.html:** This file underwent four revisions. The most significant change was the replacement of the logo image source. Initially, it pointed to `https://cloud.goskribe.com/V2_Images/logo.png`, then changed to `https://storage.googleapis.com/skribe-media-prod/mailer/logo.png`, and finally to `https://app.goskribe.com/mailer/logo.png`. A similar pattern was observed for the  `head-right-img1.png` image source, switching from `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/test/head-right-img1.png` to `https://storage.googleapis.com/skribe-media-prod/mailer/head-right-img1.png`, and ultimately  `https://app.goskribe.com/mailer/head-right-img1.png`.  The content of the email (news articles) remained unchanged throughout the revisions.


**mailer2.html:**  This file was modified five times. The changes primarily involved restructuring the layout and updating the contact information displayed.  Initially, the HTML included a user picture (`Jitender.jpg`) and displayed Jitender Malik's contact details and job title. Later revisions removed the picture and altered the displayed name to Dr. Meenakshi Rawani, along with updates to the email address and phone number.  The logo image source also shifted from `https://www.goskribe.com/images/Jitender.jpg` to `https://app.goskribe.com/mailer/logo_blue.png`, and  `https://app.goskribe.com/mailer/Jitender.jpg`  was also changed to `https://app.goskribe.com/mailer/logo_blue.png`.  The layout adjustments involved shifting the logo and contact information within the table structure to improve the visual presentation.  These changes were made within a short timeframe.
