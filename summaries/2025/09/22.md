# Activity Summary for 9/22/2025

## 12:34:55 PM
The log shows changes to server-side routing (`trustDeedRoutes.js`) and a frontend React component (`PropertyRegistrationForm.jsx`).

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\server\routes\trustDeedRoutes.js`**:  This file underwent two revisions within a short time frame (11:36:21 AM and 11:36:42 AM).  The key change was a significant refactoring of the route definitions. Initially, the routes were mostly commented out. The second revision implements authentication middleware (`passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false })`, `accessTokenAutoRefresh`, and `setAuthHeader`)  before all routes. The `multer` middleware for handling file uploads was also significantly modified to use `upload.fields(uploadFields)`  for specifying multiple file upload fields,  instead of `upload.any()`.  The commented-out authentication was removed from individual routes. A new route `/id/status` for updating status has been added.  The commented-out `initializePayment` route remains commented out.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\frontend\src\components\PropertyRegistrationForm.jsx`**: This file was updated multiple times between 11:39:10 AM and 11:42:50 AM. The component is a React form for property registration.  The changes primarily involved adding functionality for handling authentication and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Initially, there was only a form. The later revisions added functions `fetchAllRegistrations`, `fetchRegistrationById`, `handleDelete`, and `handleEdit` that interact with a backend API (`API_BASE`, which defaults to `http://localhost:4000`).  These functions now include `Authorization` headers with `Bearer` tokens retrieved from local storage. The form now displays success/error messages using `react-toastify`.  The `onSubmit` function sends POST requests to the backend, while the  `handleDelete` and `handleEdit` functions are for deleting and updating records (although the update appears to be a simplified status update).  The form itself is well-structured with validation using `formik` and `Yup`.


## 1:34:53 PM
The log shows multiple updates to a React frontend component (`PropertyRegistrationForm.jsx`) and its corresponding backend server-side code.  The frontend component, updated three times between 12:40:36 PM and 12:48:29 PM on September 22nd, 2025,  is a form for property registration.  It uses Formik for form handling, Yup for validation, and React-toastify for displaying messages.  The form fetches and displays all property registrations, allows creating new registrations, deleting existing ones, and (in a rudimentary way) editing them. The form interacts with a backend API located at `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` or `http://localhost:4000`.  Authentication appears to be handled using tokens stored in local storage.  The frontend code is heavily commented and uses Hindi for labels and error messages.

The backend (`propertyRegistrationRoutes.js` and `propertyRegistrationController.js`) handles API requests related to property registrations.  The `propertyRegistrationRoutes.js` file was updated once at 12:46:45 PM on September 22nd, 2025.  This update significantly refactored the code:  previously, authentication middleware was conditionally applied; now, authentication (`passport.authenticate('userOrAgent', { session: false })`), access token refresh (`accessTokenAutoRefresh`), and setting of auth headers (`setAuthHeader`) are consistently applied to all routes.  The `propertyRegistrationController.js`, updated once at 12:48:03 PM,  contains functions for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and getting stats for property registrations.  It uses `DOMPurify` to sanitize inputs, preventing potential XSS vulnerabilities.  The update adds a new `updateStatus` route for updating the status of property registrations and handles various statuses (`draft`, `submitted`, `approved`, `rejected`).  Error handling and logging (`logger`) are implemented throughout the controller.  The controller also validates that required fields are present before processing create requests.
