# Activity Summary for 9/15/2025

## 9:04:46 AM
The log shows two entries for `server.js`, both at 9/14/2025, with a minor time difference (6 seconds).  The code in both entries is identical.  The file `server.js` is a Node.js server setup that uses Express, connects to a database (via `connectDB`), integrates Swagger UI for API documentation, handles CORS, and implements graceful shutdown.  There are no substantive changes between the two entries.


## 10:04:46 AM
The log shows development of a mental health platform's backend API.  The `openapi.yaml` file, updated twice (9:26 AM and 9:32 AM), defines the API's structure, including schemas for users, posts, mood logs, psychologists, appointments, and polls.  The key change between the two `openapi.yaml` updates is the replacement of a localhost development server URL with  `https://backend-2mh6.onrender.com/api`.  The schema consistently uses JWT authentication (`BearerAuth`).

The `authController.js` file (9:38 AM) contains the API controllers for authentication and user registration, including features for email/contact verification, parent consent, and admin invitation.  The code is fully commented, indicating a well-documented approach but it's commented out in the log.

The `authService.js` file (9:44 AM)  contains the service layer for authentication, handling user registration, login, OTP generation and verification, parent consent initiation, and token generation.  Like `authController.js`, it's fully commented but commented out in the log.

Finally, the `authRoutes.js` file (9:45 AM) defines the API routes, separating public routes (signup, login, OTP verification, parent consent) from admin-only routes (admin invitation).  The use of middleware (`authenticate`, `authorize`) for authentication and authorization is evident.  There's a possible inconsistency in the admin routes as `/admin/verify-invite` is defined with both `GET` and `POST` methods.
