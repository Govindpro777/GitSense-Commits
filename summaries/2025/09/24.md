# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 12:51:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, a React component for a password reset functionality.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: users enter their email, and the component sends a reset link using a backend service (`userService.get`).  The changes are primarily focused on improving user experience and error handling.

Initially, simple `alert` boxes were used for feedback.  Around 12:17 AM, a loading state (`loading`) was introduced to provide visual feedback during the API call, and a `finally` block was added to ensure the loading state is always reset.  The `finally` block's syntax was slightly adjusted between 12:18:22 AM and 12:18:50 AM.  At 12:19:46 AM, the button text dynamically updates to reflect the loading state ("Sending reset link..." or "Send reset link"). Finally, at 12:20:56 AM and 12:21:13 AM, the component was updated to use a custom notification hook (`useNotification`) from `@/components/ErrorAlert/ErrorContextNotification`, suggesting a move towards a more sophisticated notification system, replacing the basic `alert` function.  The commented-out Redux-related code indicates a possible refactoring to remove Redux dependency.


## 8:34:55 AM
The log shows modifications to two React component files: `ForgotPassword.jsx` and `ChangePassword.jsx`.  Both components utilize a custom hook `useNotification` for displaying messages to the user.

`ForgotPassword.jsx` underwent several revisions between 12:52 AM and 1:16 AM on September 24, 2025.  The main change involved replacing alert boxes with the `showNotification` function for displaying success, warning, and error messages.  Initially, the code used `alert()` for all feedback.  The final version uses `showNotification` exclusively, improving user experience by providing better context through different notification types.  Redux integration (commented-out code) was removed during these changes.

`ChangePassword.jsx` was modified between 1:19 AM and 1:23 AM on September 24, 2025. The key change in this file was the replacement of a submit input with a button that is disabled while the `loading` state is true, providing feedback to the user during password change processing.  The `submitData` function was also updated to use `setLoading` to manage the loading state, improving user feedback during the API call. Similar to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, this component also removed its Redux integration, and utilizes the `useNotification` hook for feedback.  The button text was also refined from "Changing..." to "Changing Password...".


## 10:34:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, a React component for a password reset functionality.  The key changes center around the `genToken` function which handles sending password reset links.

Initially, the `genToken` function was heavily commented out.  Between 9:39:38 AM and 9:40:20 AM, the function was uncommented and a `console.log(output)` statement was added for debugging purposes.  Subsequent changes (9:41:05 AM, 9:41:15 AM, 9:45:14 AM, 9:45:50 AM) refined the error handling and message display within the `genToken` function. Specifically, the way the API response was handled changed:  accessing `output?.response?.status` and `output?.response?.message` was replaced with `output?.status` and `output?.message` respectively, simplifying the code and potentially reflecting a change in the API's response structure.  The way "Ok" and "NotExist" responses were handled was also adjusted. One change at 9:41:15 AM changed the "NotExist" response from showing a warning to a success message, which is likely a bug.  Finally, at 9:51:37 AM, the function was slightly restructured, improving readability.  The commented-out code consistently includes references to Redux, suggesting a migration away from a Redux-based state management to a more streamlined approach using React's built-in state management and a custom notification system (`useNotification`).  No significant changes were made to the UI elements of the component.


## 11:34:56 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Profile.jsx` between 10:58 AM and 11:29 AM on September 24, 2025.  The core component remains largely unchanged, displaying a journalist's profile and a list of articles.  The changes primarily focus on the presentation of the journalist's information in the left-hand section of the component.

Specifically, several edits involved updating the icons and labels related to location and outlets where the journalist has worked.  Initially, there was some redundancy in the "also seen in" section, which was subsequently refined.  The changes include replacing `/assets/tv-icon.svg` with `/assets/location5.png`,  then changing `/assets/location5.png` to `/mailer/location5.png`, and finally settling on `/assets/location1.svg` and `/assets/beat.svg` for location and beat information respectively, showing a clear effort to improve visual consistency and clarity. The size and style of the location icon also underwent several adjustments. The text associated with these icons also evolved, clarifying the meaning ("Outlets" replaced "also seen in").  No changes were made to the functionality or data structure of the article display section.  The frequent updates suggest iterative design improvements aimed at enhancing the user interface.
