# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 12:51:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, a React component for a password reset functionality.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: users enter their email, and the component sends a reset link using a backend service (`userService.get`).  The changes are primarily focused on improving user experience and error handling.

Initially, simple `alert` boxes were used for feedback.  Around 12:17 AM, a loading state (`loading`) was introduced to provide visual feedback during the API call, and a `finally` block was added to ensure the loading state is always reset.  The `finally` block's syntax was slightly adjusted between 12:18:22 AM and 12:18:50 AM.  At 12:19:46 AM, the button text dynamically updates to reflect the loading state ("Sending reset link..." or "Send reset link"). Finally, at 12:20:56 AM and 12:21:13 AM, the component was updated to use a custom notification hook (`useNotification`) from `@/components/ErrorAlert/ErrorContextNotification`, suggesting a move towards a more sophisticated notification system, replacing the basic `alert` function.  The commented-out Redux-related code indicates a possible refactoring to remove Redux dependency.


## 8:34:55 AM
The log shows modifications to two React component files: `ForgotPassword.jsx` and `ChangePassword.jsx`.  Both components utilize a custom hook `useNotification` for displaying messages to the user.

`ForgotPassword.jsx` underwent several revisions between 12:52 AM and 1:16 AM on September 24, 2025.  The main change involved replacing alert boxes with the `showNotification` function for displaying success, warning, and error messages.  Initially, the code used `alert()` for all feedback.  The final version uses `showNotification` exclusively, improving user experience by providing better context through different notification types.  Redux integration (commented-out code) was removed during these changes.

`ChangePassword.jsx` was modified between 1:19 AM and 1:23 AM on September 24, 2025. The key change in this file was the replacement of a submit input with a button that is disabled while the `loading` state is true, providing feedback to the user during password change processing.  The `submitData` function was also updated to use `setLoading` to manage the loading state, improving user feedback during the API call. Similar to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, this component also removed its Redux integration, and utilizes the `useNotification` hook for feedback.  The button text was also refined from "Changing..." to "Changing Password...".
