# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 12:51:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, a React component for a password reset functionality.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: users enter their email, and the component sends a reset link using a backend service (`userService.get`).  The changes are primarily focused on improving user experience and error handling.

Initially, simple `alert` boxes were used for feedback.  Around 12:17 AM, a loading state (`loading`) was introduced to provide visual feedback during the API call, and a `finally` block was added to ensure the loading state is always reset.  The `finally` block's syntax was slightly adjusted between 12:18:22 AM and 12:18:50 AM.  At 12:19:46 AM, the button text dynamically updates to reflect the loading state ("Sending reset link..." or "Send reset link"). Finally, at 12:20:56 AM and 12:21:13 AM, the component was updated to use a custom notification hook (`useNotification`) from `@/components/ErrorAlert/ErrorContextNotification`, suggesting a move towards a more sophisticated notification system, replacing the basic `alert` function.  The commented-out Redux-related code indicates a possible refactoring to remove Redux dependency.
