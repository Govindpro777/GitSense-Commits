# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 12:51:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, a React component for a password reset functionality.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: users enter their email, and the component sends a reset link using a backend service (`userService.get`).  The changes are primarily focused on improving user experience and error handling.

Initially, simple `alert` boxes were used for feedback.  Around 12:17 AM, a loading state (`loading`) was introduced to provide visual feedback during the API call, and a `finally` block was added to ensure the loading state is always reset.  The `finally` block's syntax was slightly adjusted between 12:18:22 AM and 12:18:50 AM.  At 12:19:46 AM, the button text dynamically updates to reflect the loading state ("Sending reset link..." or "Send reset link"). Finally, at 12:20:56 AM and 12:21:13 AM, the component was updated to use a custom notification hook (`useNotification`) from `@/components/ErrorAlert/ErrorContextNotification`, suggesting a move towards a more sophisticated notification system, replacing the basic `alert` function.  The commented-out Redux-related code indicates a possible refactoring to remove Redux dependency.


## 8:34:55 AM
The log shows modifications to two React component files: `ForgotPassword.jsx` and `ChangePassword.jsx`.  Both components utilize a custom hook `useNotification` for displaying messages to the user.

`ForgotPassword.jsx` underwent several revisions between 12:52 AM and 1:16 AM on September 24, 2025.  The main change involved replacing alert boxes with the `showNotification` function for displaying success, warning, and error messages.  Initially, the code used `alert()` for all feedback.  The final version uses `showNotification` exclusively, improving user experience by providing better context through different notification types.  Redux integration (commented-out code) was removed during these changes.

`ChangePassword.jsx` was modified between 1:19 AM and 1:23 AM on September 24, 2025. The key change in this file was the replacement of a submit input with a button that is disabled while the `loading` state is true, providing feedback to the user during password change processing.  The `submitData` function was also updated to use `setLoading` to manage the loading state, improving user feedback during the API call. Similar to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, this component also removed its Redux integration, and utilizes the `useNotification` hook for feedback.  The button text was also refined from "Changing..." to "Changing Password...".


## 10:34:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ForgotPassword.jsx`, a React component for a password reset functionality.  The key changes center around the `genToken` function which handles sending password reset links.

Initially, the `genToken` function was heavily commented out.  Between 9:39:38 AM and 9:40:20 AM, the function was uncommented and a `console.log(output)` statement was added for debugging purposes.  Subsequent changes (9:41:05 AM, 9:41:15 AM, 9:45:14 AM, 9:45:50 AM) refined the error handling and message display within the `genToken` function. Specifically, the way the API response was handled changed:  accessing `output?.response?.status` and `output?.response?.message` was replaced with `output?.status` and `output?.message` respectively, simplifying the code and potentially reflecting a change in the API's response structure.  The way "Ok" and "NotExist" responses were handled was also adjusted. One change at 9:41:15 AM changed the "NotExist" response from showing a warning to a success message, which is likely a bug.  Finally, at 9:51:37 AM, the function was slightly restructured, improving readability.  The commented-out code consistently includes references to Redux, suggesting a migration away from a Redux-based state management to a more streamlined approach using React's built-in state management and a custom notification system (`useNotification`).  No significant changes were made to the UI elements of the component.


## 11:34:56 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Profile.jsx` between 10:58 AM and 11:29 AM on September 24, 2025.  The core component remains largely unchanged, displaying a journalist's profile and a list of articles.  The changes primarily focus on the presentation of the journalist's information in the left-hand section of the component.

Specifically, several edits involved updating the icons and labels related to location and outlets where the journalist has worked.  Initially, there was some redundancy in the "also seen in" section, which was subsequently refined.  The changes include replacing `/assets/tv-icon.svg` with `/assets/location5.png`,  then changing `/assets/location5.png` to `/mailer/location5.png`, and finally settling on `/assets/location1.svg` and `/assets/beat.svg` for location and beat information respectively, showing a clear effort to improve visual consistency and clarity. The size and style of the location icon also underwent several adjustments. The text associated with these icons also evolved, clarifying the meaning ("Outlets" replaced "also seen in").  No changes were made to the functionality or data structure of the article display section.  The frequent updates suggest iterative design improvements aimed at enhancing the user interface.


## 12:35:14 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `Profile.jsx` component between 11:38 AM and 12:08 PM on September 24, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be on the styling and presentation of a journalist's profile, including social media links and articles.

The `Profile.jsx` component consistently displays a list of articles, each with a title, description, date, and a link. The description is truncated to 100 characters with an ellipsis.  The visual presentation heavily utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

Specific changes over time include:

* **11:38:39 AM:** Initial commit of the `Profile.jsx` component.  The component structure, including sections for profile details, social media links (placeholders), and articles, is established.

* **11:38:57 AM - 11:41:47 AM:** No significant changes are observed in the code during this time period.


* **11:41:47 AM:** A minor change is observed in the location icon's source (`/assets/location1.svg` to `/assets/location2.svg`).

* **11:45:56 AM:** A minor adjustment is made to the spacing of profile details by changing the `mb-4` class to `mb-3` in one of the divs.

* **11:47:25 AM - 11:49:27 AM:**  A second instance of the "Times of India" link and related information is added to the profile details section, duplicating existing information about the journalist's affiliation.

The frequent changes to the `Profile.jsx` component suggest iterative design and refinement, particularly regarding the visual presentation of social media links. The changes to the journalist's name indicate the component is being tested with different profile data.  The `Footer.jsx` update suggests parallel development work occurring on other parts of the application.


## 5:34:49 PM
The log shows development activity on a Next.js frontend application between 4:42 PM and 4:45 PM on September 24, 2025.  The main focus is on `page.js` and `globals.css`.

`page.js`:  Initially, the page contained styling using Tailwind CSS classes  (4:42 PM). These styles were then simplified (4:42 PM).  Later, a `Navbar` component was integrated (4:45 PM).

`globals.css`: This file defines a light and dark theme using CSS variables (4:43 PM). A later revision removed the light theme styling, leaving only the dark theme definition (4:43 PM).

`Navbar.jsx`: A simple `Navbar` component was created and added to the project (4:46 PM).  It currently only renders a `div` with the text "nav".

The changes show a rapid iterative development process, with styling adjustments and component additions within a short timeframe.  The styling in `page.js` evolved from detailed classes to a simpler approach, possibly reflecting design choices or refactoring.


## 6:03:33 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `Skribe365.html` and `check.html` between 5:13 PM and 5:59 PM on September 24, 2025.  The `Skribe365.html` file underwent substantial styling changes, transitioning from a dark background to a white background.  Font sizes, colors, and padding were adjusted throughout the newsletter's sections (Business & Economy, Technology, Legal & Administration, Health & Wellness, Politics, Education).  The logo was also updated, with a change in the alt text and dimensions.  Around 5:34 PM, the color scheme of links and headings within the news entries was standardized to a consistent shade of blue (`#39B0E3`).  Finally, around 5:42 PM, `check.html` was overwritten entirely with the content of `Skribe365.html` suggesting a potential merge or renaming operation.  The final edits to `check.html` involved minor adjustments to font sizes and addition of border-radius property to h2 tags.  The changes between 5:42 PM and 5:59 PM primarily involved tweaking the font sizes and padding, aiming for a more consistent visual layout.


## 10:25:57 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `check.html` between 6:03 PM and 6:08 PM on September 24, 2025.  The file is an HTML document that appears to be a newsletter template.  The content remains largely consistent across all revisions, with the core structure—a newsletter featuring journalist moves categorized by sections (Business & Economy, Technology, Legal & Administration, Sports, Defence & Security, Current Affairs, City & General, Health & Wellness)—unchanged.  Each section contains entries for different news outlets, including The Quint, Digit, The Print, Deccan Herald, NDTV India, India Today, and The Financial Express,  providing details about journalist appointments and contact information.  There are no discernible changes in the content itself across the different commits; only timestamps change. The minor variations in timestamps suggest iterative saves or minor adjustments possibly related to formatting or very minor code changes that are not visible in the provided diff.
