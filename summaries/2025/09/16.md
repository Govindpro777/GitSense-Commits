# Activity Summary for 9/16/2025

## 12:52:45 PM
The log shows development across a trust deed management system, with updates to server-side models, controllers, routes, and a frontend form component.

The most significant changes occurred between 11:37 AM and 12:48 PM on September 16th, 2025.  The `TrustDeed.js` model underwent a major revision, simplifying the schema and improving data validation and type handling.  Specifically, the schema was refactored to use `trim: true` for string fields and added validation for ensuring at least one trustee.  File uploads are now managed with filenames for ID cards and photos, improving organization and efficiency.

The `trustDeedController.js` file was updated to reflect the changes in the model. It now handles data more efficiently and includes detailed input validation and error handling.  The controller implements the creation, retrieval, and potential update/deletion of trust deeds.

The `trustDeedRoutes.js` file was modified to incorporate Multer for file uploads, defining specific upload fields for trustees and witnesses, and updating the route definitions for clarity and efficiency.  The changes streamline the handling of trust deed creation and management through defined API endpoints.

Lastly, the `TrustDeedForm.jsx` component went through multiple iterations, likely reflecting adjustments to match the backend changes.  The code suggests a form for creating trust deeds with detailed fields for trustees, witnesses, and other relevant information.  The component includes client-side validation using Formik and Yup, and handles form submission via a FormData object. The repeated commented-out code in the frontend suggests iterative development and testing.  The final version likely reflects the updated structure and handling of file uploads in the backend.

The overall pattern reveals a consistent effort towards refining the application's data structure and streamlining its functionality, focusing on improved data validation, more efficient file handling, and enhanced user experience.

The log shows updates to frontend and backend components of a real-estate application, focusing on sale deed and trust deed forms.

On **9/16/2025, 12:55:44 PM**, `TrustDeedForm.jsx` was updated. This component is a React form for creating trust deeds.  The code includes a comprehensive validation schema using Yup, handling various fields like trustee details, trust purpose, and witnesses. A noteworthy function `convertToIndianWords` converts numerical amounts into Indian words. The form manages state using `useState` and `useCallback` and submits data as a FormData object to a backend endpoint (`http://localhost:4000/api/trust-deed`). The code is heavily commented and uses Hindi for field labels and error messages.

Later, at **9/16/2025, 1:20:57 PM**, the backend model `SaleDeed.js` was updated. This update refactors the schema to use individual schemas for sellers, buyers, witnesses, rooms, and trees instead of using `mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed`. This change improves data structure and type safety.  The schema defines fields for various property details, including location, dimensions, facilities, and financial calculations.  It also includes provisions for file uploads.

The corresponding controller, `saleDeedController.js` (updated at **9/16/2025, 1:21:11 PM**), handles API requests for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting sale deeds.  It parses JSON data from requests, manages file uploads, and interacts with the `SaleDeed` model.  The controller includes functions for handling pagination and filtering in data retrieval and incorporates authentication checks.  The `create` function processes the request body and file uploads and saves the data to the database.  `getAll` retrieves and paginates the data. `getById` is used for getting details of a specific sale deed. `update` allows for updates to existing records.

The routing file, `saleDeedRoutes.js`, was updated twice.  The first update at **9/16/2025, 1:21:35 PM** and the second at **9/16/2025, 1:22:32 PM** show changes to the authentication middleware (`authMiddleware` or `passport.authenticate`). The initial version includes `setAuthHeader`, `accessTokenAutoRefresh`, and optional passport authentication for all routes. The second commit removed the authentication middleware suggesting a change in authentication approach. The routes are defined for creating, reading, updating, and deleting sale deeds using the `saleDeedController`.  Multer is used to handle file uploads, with a 10MB limit per file and a maximum of 10 files per request.  Only specific file types (PDF, images, and some document types) are allowed.

Finally, the `SaleDeedForm.jsx` component (updated at **9/16/2025, 1:23:19 PM**) is a React form for creating sale deeds. It manages a significant amount of form data, including dynamic arrays for sellers, buyers, witnesses, rooms, and trees, using the `useState` hook.  It includes utility functions for unit conversions (sq meters, meters) and handles file uploads, storing them in a state variable. Calculations are performed and displayed conditionally, and preview mode is supported.  The componentâ€™s state management reflects the complexity of the data model.
