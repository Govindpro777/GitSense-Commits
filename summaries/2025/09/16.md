# Activity Summary for 9/16/2025

## 12:52:45 PM
The log shows development across a trust deed management system, with updates to server-side models, controllers, routes, and a frontend form component.

The most significant changes occurred between 11:37 AM and 12:48 PM on September 16th, 2025.  The `TrustDeed.js` model underwent a major revision, simplifying the schema and improving data validation and type handling.  Specifically, the schema was refactored to use `trim: true` for string fields and added validation for ensuring at least one trustee.  File uploads are now managed with filenames for ID cards and photos, improving organization and efficiency.

The `trustDeedController.js` file was updated to reflect the changes in the model. It now handles data more efficiently and includes detailed input validation and error handling.  The controller implements the creation, retrieval, and potential update/deletion of trust deeds.

The `trustDeedRoutes.js` file was modified to incorporate Multer for file uploads, defining specific upload fields for trustees and witnesses, and updating the route definitions for clarity and efficiency.  The changes streamline the handling of trust deed creation and management through defined API endpoints.

Lastly, the `TrustDeedForm.jsx` component went through multiple iterations, likely reflecting adjustments to match the backend changes.  The code suggests a form for creating trust deeds with detailed fields for trustees, witnesses, and other relevant information.  The component includes client-side validation using Formik and Yup, and handles form submission via a FormData object. The repeated commented-out code in the frontend suggests iterative development and testing.  The final version likely reflects the updated structure and handling of file uploads in the backend.

The overall pattern reveals a consistent effort towards refining the application's data structure and streamlining its functionality, focusing on improved data validation, more efficient file handling, and enhanced user experience.

The log shows updates to frontend and backend components of a real-estate application, focusing on sale deed and trust deed forms.

On **9/16/2025, 12:55:44 PM**, `TrustDeedForm.jsx` was updated. This component is a React form for creating trust deeds.  The code includes a comprehensive validation schema using Yup, handling various fields like trustee details, trust purpose, and witnesses. A noteworthy function `convertToIndianWords` converts numerical amounts into Indian words. The form manages state using `useState` and `useCallback` and submits data as a FormData object to a backend endpoint (`http://localhost:4000/api/trust-deed`). The code is heavily commented and uses Hindi for field labels and error messages.

Later, at **9/16/2025, 1:20:57 PM**, the backend model `SaleDeed.js` was updated. This update refactors the schema to use individual schemas for sellers, buyers, witnesses, rooms, and trees instead of using `mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed`. This change improves data structure and type safety.  The schema defines fields for various property details, including location, dimensions, facilities, and financial calculations.  It also includes provisions for file uploads.

The corresponding controller, `saleDeedController.js` (updated at **9/16/2025, 1:21:11 PM**), handles API requests for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting sale deeds.  It parses JSON data from requests, manages file uploads, and interacts with the `SaleDeed` model.  The controller includes functions for handling pagination and filtering in data retrieval and incorporates authentication checks.  The `create` function processes the request body and file uploads and saves the data to the database.  `getAll` retrieves and paginates the data. `getById` is used for getting details of a specific sale deed. `update` allows for updates to existing records.

The routing file, `saleDeedRoutes.js`, was updated twice.  The first update at **9/16/2025, 1:21:35 PM** and the second at **9/16/2025, 1:22:32 PM** show changes to the authentication middleware (`authMiddleware` or `passport.authenticate`). The initial version includes `setAuthHeader`, `accessTokenAutoRefresh`, and optional passport authentication for all routes. The second commit removed the authentication middleware suggesting a change in authentication approach. The routes are defined for creating, reading, updating, and deleting sale deeds using the `saleDeedController`.  Multer is used to handle file uploads, with a 10MB limit per file and a maximum of 10 files per request.  Only specific file types (PDF, images, and some document types) are allowed.

Finally, the `SaleDeedForm.jsx` component (updated at **9/16/2025, 1:23:19 PM**) is a React form for creating sale deeds. It manages a significant amount of form data, including dynamic arrays for sellers, buyers, witnesses, rooms, and trees, using the `useState` hook.  It includes utility functions for unit conversions (sq meters, meters) and handles file uploads, storing them in a state variable. Calculations are performed and displayed conditionally, and preview mode is supported.  The componentâ€™s state management reflects the complexity of the data model.


## 2:52:49 PM
The log shows significant development activity on a sale deed application, encompassing both frontend and backend components.

**Frontend (SaleDeedForm.jsx):**  The frontend component underwent a single major update at 2:21:34 PM on September 16, 2025.  This update introduces a comprehensive React component for managing a sale deed form.  The component includes extensive state management for various form fields, dynamic arrays (sellers, buyers, witnesses, rooms, trees), file uploads, and local storage for draft saving and auto-saving functionality (every 5 seconds).  It utilizes utility functions for unit conversions (square meters and meters).

**Backend:** Multiple updates occurred on the backend between 2:28:12 PM and 2:50:47 PM on September 16, 2025, primarily focused on the `/saleDeedRoutes.js` and `saleDeedController.js` files.

* **Server (app.js):** The server code was updated at 2:28:12 PM to increase the JSON upload limit to 10MB, incorporate a health check endpoint, and add a global error handler, including handling of Multer errors (file size limits and unexpected files).


* **Sale Deed Routes (saleDeedRoutes.js):**  The `saleDeedRoutes.js` file saw multiple revisions. Initially, the file contained commented-out code using `multer` for file uploads and authentication middleware (`passport`, `accessTokenAutoRefresh`, `setAuthHeader`). Later revisions simplified the code, removing the `multer` configuration and authentication middleware, and using a more concise import style for the controller functions.  The final version (2:50:30 PM) shows direct importing and routing using `createSaleDeed`, `getAllSaleDeeds`, `getSaleDeed`, `updateSaleDeed`, and `deleteSaleDeed`.


* **Sale Deed Controller (saleDeedController.js):**  The controller underwent a single major update at 2:47:26 PM, closely following the changes in the routes file. This update provides the implementation details for handling the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of sale deed records. It also demonstrates robust error handling, JSON parsing, and file processing within the context of a sale deed object. The functions (`create`, `getAll`, `getById`, `update`) are well-structured and address common API operations.  The commented-out code suggests earlier versions likely handled more complex authentication and file upload mechanics.


* **Sale Deed Model (SaleDeed.js):** The SaleDeed model was updated at 2:49:30 PM and then again at 2:49:58 PM. The initial version uses a simpler schema with `mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed` for dynamic arrays. The second version (2:49:58 PM)  replaced the `mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed` type  with clearly defined schemas for `sellers`, `buyers`, `witnesses`, `rooms`, and `trees`, improving data structure and type safety.

* **Will Deed Routes (willDeedRoutes.js):** This file was updated at 2:50:47 PM to define routes for handling will deeds.  The code uses `multer` for file uploads, handling multiple files with dynamic field names.


The overall pattern indicates a refactoring of the sale deed API endpoint, moving towards a cleaner, more efficient, and possibly more secure implementation. The changes to the model suggest a focus on improving data integrity and schema design.  The introduction of the health check and enhanced error handling on the server side enhances the application's resilience and maintainability.
