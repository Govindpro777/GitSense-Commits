# Activity Summary for 9/16/2025

## 12:52:45 PM
The log shows development across a trust deed management system, with updates to server-side models, controllers, routes, and a frontend form component.

The most significant changes occurred between 11:37 AM and 12:48 PM on September 16th, 2025.  The `TrustDeed.js` model underwent a major revision, simplifying the schema and improving data validation and type handling.  Specifically, the schema was refactored to use `trim: true` for string fields and added validation for ensuring at least one trustee.  File uploads are now managed with filenames for ID cards and photos, improving organization and efficiency.

The `trustDeedController.js` file was updated to reflect the changes in the model. It now handles data more efficiently and includes detailed input validation and error handling.  The controller implements the creation, retrieval, and potential update/deletion of trust deeds.

The `trustDeedRoutes.js` file was modified to incorporate Multer for file uploads, defining specific upload fields for trustees and witnesses, and updating the route definitions for clarity and efficiency.  The changes streamline the handling of trust deed creation and management through defined API endpoints.

Lastly, the `TrustDeedForm.jsx` component went through multiple iterations, likely reflecting adjustments to match the backend changes.  The code suggests a form for creating trust deeds with detailed fields for trustees, witnesses, and other relevant information.  The component includes client-side validation using Formik and Yup, and handles form submission via a FormData object. The repeated commented-out code in the frontend suggests iterative development and testing.  The final version likely reflects the updated structure and handling of file uploads in the backend.

The overall pattern reveals a consistent effort towards refining the application's data structure and streamlining its functionality, focusing on improved data validation, more efficient file handling, and enhanced user experience.
