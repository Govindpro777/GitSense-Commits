# Activity Summary for 9/21/2025

## 5:34:19 PM
The log shows two entries for a `.env` file, both on September 21st, 2025, within a minute of each other (4:50:17 PM and 4:50:29 PM).  Both entries define environment variables for a server application, including port number, database connection strings, frontend host, password salt, email settings (host, port, user, password, from address), and JWT secret keys.

The key difference between the two entries lies in the `DATABASE_URL` variable. The first entry uses  `mongodb+srv://riturajgupta499:qUIICffFBUfBvZFz@rituraj.hadlokn.mongodb.net/...`, while the second entry includes this URL *and*  another one (`mongodb+srv://rakeskumarkumar0:8pfJv3Hv8oc2Tl9p@cluster0.vscbz.mongodb.net/property?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`), suggesting an addition of a second database connection or a temporary addition that was quickly revised.  All other environment variables remain consistent between the two entries.

On September 21st, 2025, at 6:33:21 PM, significant changes were made to `TrustDeedForm.jsx`.  This component, built using React, Formik, and Yup, handles a trust deed form.  The update includes comprehensive validation using Yup, supporting Hindi text for error messages and form labels.  The validation schema covers various fields, including trust details, trustee information (with support for multiple trustees), functional domains, purposes, terms, and witnesses.  A notable function, `convertToIndianWords`, converts numeric amounts into their Hindi word equivalents.

The component uses a custom `FormWorkflowProvider` for form management, allowing users to preview and submit the form.  The `onSubmit` function initially performs client-side validation before proceeding to a preview stage.  If validation fails, a temporary error message is displayed. The submission (`onSubmitDirect`) uses FormData to handle the submission of the form data, including file uploads for trustee IDs and photos.  The `handleAmountChange` function updates the starting amount in both numeric and Hindi word formats.  Initial values are populated from a `workflowFormData` object, likely providing a mechanism for resuming incomplete forms.  The code suggests a multi-step form process (potentially involving payment).  The code includes various checks ensuring mandatory fields are filled for trustees and witnesses.

This commit at 9/21/2025, 6:35:12 PM modifies `SaleDeedForm.jsx`, a React component for a sale deed form.  The component is significantly enhanced to manage a complex form with multiple sections. Key updates include:

* **Extensive Form State Management:** The component uses `useState` to manage a large amount of form data, including details about sellers, buyers, witnesses, property dimensions, various property features (rooms, trees, shops, mall floors, facilities), and uploaded files.  It also manages calculation results and draft saving functionality.

* **Dynamic Arrays:**  The component uses dynamic arrays for sellers, buyers, witnesses, rooms, trees, and shops, allowing users to add and remove entries as needed.  Each array element contains relevant fields (e.g., name, address, mobile).

* **File Upload Handling:**  The component includes functionality for uploading files, managing file previews, and removing files. Uploaded files are stored in an array with unique IDs.

* **Calculation Logic (partially visible):** Constants define rates for various property features (stamp duty, registration charges, etc.). Functions exist for unit conversions (sq meters, meters).  The code suggests a calculation feature (though the full calculation logic is not shown).

* **Draft Saving and Loading:** Functionality to save the form data to local storage as a draft and load it later is implemented, using `localStorage`.

* **Internationalization (i18n):** Uses `react-i18next` for translation, indicated by `{t}` function calls.

* **Form Workflow Integration:** The component interacts with a `FormWorkflowProvider` and `useFormWorkflow` hook, suggesting integration into a larger form workflow system.


The code is well-structured, utilizing functional components and hooks. The extensive state management reflects the complexity of the sale deed form, which requires handling diverse data types and dynamically updated arrays.  The inclusion of draft saving improves user experience by allowing users to save their progress and resume later.
