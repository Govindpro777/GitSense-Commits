# Activity Summary for 9/21/2025

## 5:34:19 PM
The log shows two entries for a `.env` file, both on September 21st, 2025, within a minute of each other (4:50:17 PM and 4:50:29 PM).  Both entries define environment variables for a server application, including port number, database connection strings, frontend host, password salt, email settings (host, port, user, password, from address), and JWT secret keys.

The key difference between the two entries lies in the `DATABASE_URL` variable. The first entry uses  `mongodb+srv://riturajgupta499:qUIICffFBUfBvZFz@rituraj.hadlokn.mongodb.net/...`, while the second entry includes this URL *and*  another one (`mongodb+srv://rakeskumarkumar0:8pfJv3Hv8oc2Tl9p@cluster0.vscbz.mongodb.net/property?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`), suggesting an addition of a second database connection or a temporary addition that was quickly revised.  All other environment variables remain consistent between the two entries.
