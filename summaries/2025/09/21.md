# Activity Summary for 9/21/2025

## 5:34:19 PM
The log shows two entries for a `.env` file, both on September 21st, 2025, within a minute of each other (4:50:17 PM and 4:50:29 PM).  Both entries define environment variables for a server application, including port number, database connection strings, frontend host, password salt, email settings (host, port, user, password, from address), and JWT secret keys.

The key difference between the two entries lies in the `DATABASE_URL` variable. The first entry uses  `mongodb+srv://riturajgupta499:qUIICffFBUfBvZFz@rituraj.hadlokn.mongodb.net/...`, while the second entry includes this URL *and*  another one (`mongodb+srv://rakeskumarkumar0:8pfJv3Hv8oc2Tl9p@cluster0.vscbz.mongodb.net/property?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`), suggesting an addition of a second database connection or a temporary addition that was quickly revised.  All other environment variables remain consistent between the two entries.

On September 21st, 2025, at 6:33:21 PM, significant changes were made to `TrustDeedForm.jsx`.  This component, built using React, Formik, and Yup, handles a trust deed form.  The update includes comprehensive validation using Yup, supporting Hindi text for error messages and form labels.  The validation schema covers various fields, including trust details, trustee information (with support for multiple trustees), functional domains, purposes, terms, and witnesses.  A notable function, `convertToIndianWords`, converts numeric amounts into their Hindi word equivalents.

The component uses a custom `FormWorkflowProvider` for form management, allowing users to preview and submit the form.  The `onSubmit` function initially performs client-side validation before proceeding to a preview stage.  If validation fails, a temporary error message is displayed. The submission (`onSubmitDirect`) uses FormData to handle the submission of the form data, including file uploads for trustee IDs and photos.  The `handleAmountChange` function updates the starting amount in both numeric and Hindi word formats.  Initial values are populated from a `workflowFormData` object, likely providing a mechanism for resuming incomplete forms.  The code suggests a multi-step form process (potentially involving payment).  The code includes various checks ensuring mandatory fields are filled for trustees and witnesses.
