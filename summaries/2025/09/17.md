# Activity Summary for 9/17/2025

## 12:59:43 AM
The log shows a series of changes primarily focused on the `openapi.yaml` file, which appears to be an OpenAPI specification for a backend API.  The file underwent multiple revisions between 12:09 AM and 12:52 AM on September 17th, 2025.  Initially, the file contained a full OpenAPI definition, detailing various API endpoints related to user authentication (`/auth/*`), including signup, login, OTP verification (email and contact), and parent consent verification.  The specification also describes schemas for users, posts, mood logs, psychologists, appointments, and polls, suggesting a mental health platform.

Around 12:27 AM, the entire content of `openapi.yaml` was commented out, resulting in an empty file (or a file with only commented-out code).  This was followed by further commits which kept the file commented-out.  This pattern suggests a possible temporary removal or disabling of the API documentation, perhaps during a refactoring or deployment process.

A separate file, `questionnaireRoutes.js`, was updated at 12:50 AM. This file contains code for an Express.js API route handling questionnaires.  The changes include adding functionality to submit questionnaire responses, retrieve a user's response history, and create questionnaires (with admin authorization).  The route uses middleware for authentication and authorization.  The code calculates a score based on the responses, assigns a category based on this score, and provides recommendations based on the determined category.  There's a helper function `getRecommendations` to map the category to a list of recommendations.  The file also handles error and success responses, logging errors using a logger function.


## 2:03:07 PM
The log shows two revisions of the `openapi.yaml` file, describing the API specification for KidManTree backend.  Both revisions are identical, indicating no actual code changes were made between 1:01:04 PM and 1:01:36 PM on September 17th, 2025. The file defines various API endpoints related to user authentication (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/verify-contact-otp`, `/auth/verify-email-otp`, `/auth/resend-otp`), and data models for Users, Posts, MoodLogs, Psychologists, Appointments, and Polls.  The API uses JWT authentication (`BearerAuth`).  There's a consistent structure for defining request bodies and response schemas (using `ApiResponse` and `ErrorResponse` schemas).
