# Activity Summary for 9/17/2025

## 12:59:43 AM
The log shows a series of changes primarily focused on the `openapi.yaml` file, which appears to be an OpenAPI specification for a backend API.  The file underwent multiple revisions between 12:09 AM and 12:52 AM on September 17th, 2025.  Initially, the file contained a full OpenAPI definition, detailing various API endpoints related to user authentication (`/auth/*`), including signup, login, OTP verification (email and contact), and parent consent verification.  The specification also describes schemas for users, posts, mood logs, psychologists, appointments, and polls, suggesting a mental health platform.

Around 12:27 AM, the entire content of `openapi.yaml` was commented out, resulting in an empty file (or a file with only commented-out code).  This was followed by further commits which kept the file commented-out.  This pattern suggests a possible temporary removal or disabling of the API documentation, perhaps during a refactoring or deployment process.

A separate file, `questionnaireRoutes.js`, was updated at 12:50 AM. This file contains code for an Express.js API route handling questionnaires.  The changes include adding functionality to submit questionnaire responses, retrieve a user's response history, and create questionnaires (with admin authorization).  The route uses middleware for authentication and authorization.  The code calculates a score based on the responses, assigns a category based on this score, and provides recommendations based on the determined category.  There's a helper function `getRecommendations` to map the category to a list of recommendations.  The file also handles error and success responses, logging errors using a logger function.


## 2:03:07 PM
The log shows two revisions of the `openapi.yaml` file, describing the API specification for KidManTree backend.  Both revisions are identical, indicating no actual code changes were made between 1:01:04 PM and 1:01:36 PM on September 17th, 2025. The file defines various API endpoints related to user authentication (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/verify-contact-otp`, `/auth/verify-email-otp`, `/auth/resend-otp`), and data models for Users, Posts, MoodLogs, Psychologists, Appointments, and Polls.  The API uses JWT authentication (`BearerAuth`).  There's a consistent structure for defining request bodies and response schemas (using `ApiResponse` and `ErrorResponse` schemas).


## 4:13:50 PM
The log shows a single entry for `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\frontend\src\components\PropertySaleCertificateForm.jsx` on September 17, 2025, at 4:08:35 PM.  This file contains a large, commented-out React component for a property sale certificate form.  The component utilizes Formik for form handling, Yup for validation, and react-toastify for feedback.  It includes extensive state management for various form sections (purchasers, witnesses, payments, floors),  initial values for numerous fields related to bank information, property details, boundary details, legal and agreement details, and calculated fields.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to helper functions, particularly `numberToWordsIndian` for converting numbers to Indian number words, and various data structures (`propertyData`, `legalData`, `locationData`) that appear designed for auto-populating form fields based on property category and location.  The commented-out nature suggests the component is under development or has been temporarily disabled.  The validation schema uses Hindi text for error messages.


## 5:14:51 PM
The log shows a series of code changes across several files within a Node.js (Express.js) backend and React frontend application for managing property sale certificates.  Significant changes are made to the file upload functionality, particularly within the `propertySaleCertificateRoutes.js` file.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\frontend\src\components\PropertySaleCertificateForm.jsx`:** This file appears to contain the React component for the form used to create property sale certificates.  Two nearly identical entries exist at 4:46 PM on September 17, 2025, suggesting a minor, insignificant code change or a simple save operation. The commented-out code shows a comprehensive form structure for capturing extensive property and owner details, including validation rules written in Hindi.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\server\models\PropertySaleCertificate.js`:** This file defines the Mongoose schema for a property sale certificate. The schema is extensive, reflecting the complexity of the form. It includes fields for Bank information, property details, legal information, agreement details, and dynamic arrays for purchasers, witnesses, payments, and floors.  The timestamp (4:48:21 PM on September 17, 2025) suggests this schema was defined or updated at that time. The data types, validation rules, and default values provide structure for the backend data storage of the property sale certificates.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\server\controllers\propertySaleCertificateController.js`:** This file contains the controllers for handling API requests related to property sale certificates. It includes functions for creating, retrieving (by ID and all), and likely updating and deleting certificates.  The creation controller handles file uploads, parsing JSON arrays from the request body, and creates a new certificate document in the database. The timestamp is 4:49:29 PM on September 17, 2025.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\server\routes\propertySaleCertificateRoutes.js`:**  This file defines the Express.js routes for handling requests related to property sale certificates (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).  Multiple revisions occurred between 4:49:53 PM and 4:56:01 PM on September 17, 2025.  The changes focus on refining the multer configuration for file uploads. Initially, it uses diskStorage to store files on the disk, but later it switches to memoryStorage to store files in memory before processing.  A recurring theme is the handling of multiple file uploads (images and documents), accompanied by validation using express-validator.  The file upload size limit is reduced from 10MB to 5MB across multiple updates.  The allowed file types are also narrowed to only jpg, jpeg, and png in the final version of this file.  Importantly, the controller import changes from the original `require` syntax to `import`.  This implies a shift in the module import system to the ES modules that are compatible with the newer Node.js versions.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Ayush\Johy\server\app.js`:**  This is the main application file which initializes the Express.js app, sets up middleware (CORS, JSON parsing, Passport), loads routes and sets up a static file server for the uploads folder.  Multiple revisions occurred between 4:50:35 PM and 4:51:50 PM on September 17, 2025.  The changes included an increase of the JSON body size limit and the addition of a health check endpoint and global error handler that specifically handles multer errors, making the application more robust. The most notable change was removing the route definition for `propertySaleCertificateRoutes`, suggesting a potential refactoring or temporary removal. The final version of the file re-includes the routes.


In summary, the code changes reflect the development and refinement of an API for managing property sale certificates.  A significant focus is on handling file uploads efficiently and securely, as well as implementing robust input validation and error handling.  The updates to the `propertySaleCertificateRoutes.js` file suggest an iterative improvement process, possibly driven by testing and feedback. The changes to the `server/app.js` file reflects a move toward improved error handling and performance optimization.
