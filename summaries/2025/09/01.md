# Activity Summary for 9/1/2025

## 11:21:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CampaignArticles.jsx` between 10:37 AM and 11:13 AM on September 1st, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is refining the component's article fetching and filtering logic.

Initially, the code included commented-out sections related to date range selection and a `getBrandData` function for managing selected keywords.  These sections were progressively removed in later commits.  The `getBrandData` function was eventually uncommented in the final commit but now triggers a warning alert instead of a notification.

A significant change was made to the `selectedFilters` state in the final commit (11:13:27 AM).  Its initialization was corrected to include default empty arrays for "Quoted Spokespeople" and "Topics," fixing a potential issue.  This is likely a bug fix addressing unexpected behavior related to filter handling.

The `articlesFetch` function consistently sends a request to an API endpoint defined by `ARTICLES_BY_ID` (which seems to derive its value from `ARTICLES_BY_JID` constant). This function handles different API response statuses ("Ok," "Failed," "No Keyword"), displaying appropriate notifications using the `showNotification` function. The response data is mapped into a format suitable for the `BrandArticle` component.

Several `useEffect` hooks manage state updates based on `brandKeywords`, `selectedFilters`, and other variables. One `useEffect` fetches articles when the `selectedKeyword`, `spokesPerson`, `topic`, `currentPage`, `startDate`, and `endDate` change; another effect sets the `startDate` and `endDate` based on `campCreatedDate`, calculating a range of 30 days.  A substantial portion of commented-out code was removed from the final version (11:13:27 AM commit).  The removal suggests a streamlining or simplification of the component's functionality to make it more concise and maintainable.  The final commit also refactors the warning for one selected keyword from a notification to an alert.


## 12:21:26 PM
The log shows multiple code changes across two files (`graphics.controller.js` and `UploadedFilesModal.jsx`) within a short timeframe on September 1st, 2025.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Backend\controller\graphics.controller.js`**: This file underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on the `createOrder` function.  Initially, this function was fully implemented but contained commented-out sections.  Later revisions  uncommented portions of the `createOrder` function, and added functionality for handling existing customers (`customerId`). A significant change involved making image and text files mandatory for order creation,  previously only images were mandated.  The overall pattern is iterative refinement of order creation, including error handling and customer management.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend\src\components\GraphicsOrder\UploadedFilesModal.jsx`**: This React component displays uploaded files.  Changes in this file introduced a search functionality (`handleImageSearch`) to search for similar images using a separate API (`IMAGE_SEARCH_API`).  The UI was also updated to clearly indicate mandatory text files, by adding a warning message in the "Text Files" section.  A minor update removed the percentage display from tab labels.  The file shows consistent development towards improved user experience and functionality related to file management.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend\src\components\GraphicsOrder\FileUploadModal.jsx`**: This React component handles file uploads. The most significant change was the enforcement of at least one text file for upload, previously optional.  This modification is consistent with the change made to the backend  `createOrder` function to make text files mandatory. The UI remained largely unchanged, mainly focusing on the validation logic for uploaded files.


## 12:21:51 PM
The provided code log shows two nearly identical versions of `CampaignArticles.jsx`  from 9/1/2025, differing only by a one-minute timestamp.  The file is a React component that fetches and displays articles based on various filters (keywords, spokespeople, topics, dates).

Key updates between the versions are minimal and don't appear to be functional changes in the code itself; the commit history would be necessary to determine the actual intention.  The code within the two timestamps is largely the same.

The component uses `userService.post` to fetch articles from an API endpoint defined by `ARTICLES_BY_JID`. The response is handled, mapping the API's data structure into a format suitable for the `BrandArticle` component.  Error handling is implemented using a custom notification system (`useNotification`).

A significant portion of the code is commented out, including a large section related to date range selection (`handleDateRangeChange`).  This suggests potential work-in-progress or refactoring.  The commented-out code suggests that date range functionality previously existed and may be re-implemented in the future.

The `articlesFetch` function is updated to use a `useRef` hook (`isFetching`) to prevent duplicate calls, enhancing efficiency.  The function now also handles the cases where no keyword is found or when an error occurs during the API call with a more robust error handling process than the commented out version.  The main change here is better error handling, and preventing multiple calls to the API.

A `generateUUID` function is present, used to generate a unique identifier (`trackingId`), though its exact purpose within the component isn't explicitly stated in this snippet.

The component uses several `useEffect` hooks to manage state updates based on various dependencies, including filtering criteria and API responses.  One `useEffect` hook initializes the `startDate` and `endDate` for a 30-day period from the campaign's creation date.

In summary, the changes between the two log entries are insignificant, but the file itself represents a React component for displaying campaign articles with features for filtering and handling API calls, error handling, and preventing duplicate API calls.  The commented-out code hints at past features or ongoing development.
