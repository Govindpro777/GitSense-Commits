# Activity Summary for 9/1/2025

## 11:21:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CampaignArticles.jsx` between 10:37 AM and 11:13 AM on September 1st, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is refining the component's article fetching and filtering logic.

Initially, the code included commented-out sections related to date range selection and a `getBrandData` function for managing selected keywords.  These sections were progressively removed in later commits.  The `getBrandData` function was eventually uncommented in the final commit but now triggers a warning alert instead of a notification.

A significant change was made to the `selectedFilters` state in the final commit (11:13:27 AM).  Its initialization was corrected to include default empty arrays for "Quoted Spokespeople" and "Topics," fixing a potential issue.  This is likely a bug fix addressing unexpected behavior related to filter handling.

The `articlesFetch` function consistently sends a request to an API endpoint defined by `ARTICLES_BY_ID` (which seems to derive its value from `ARTICLES_BY_JID` constant). This function handles different API response statuses ("Ok," "Failed," "No Keyword"), displaying appropriate notifications using the `showNotification` function. The response data is mapped into a format suitable for the `BrandArticle` component.

Several `useEffect` hooks manage state updates based on `brandKeywords`, `selectedFilters`, and other variables. One `useEffect` fetches articles when the `selectedKeyword`, `spokesPerson`, `topic`, `currentPage`, `startDate`, and `endDate` change; another effect sets the `startDate` and `endDate` based on `campCreatedDate`, calculating a range of 30 days.  A substantial portion of commented-out code was removed from the final version (11:13:27 AM commit).  The removal suggests a streamlining or simplification of the component's functionality to make it more concise and maintainable.  The final commit also refactors the warning for one selected keyword from a notification to an alert.
