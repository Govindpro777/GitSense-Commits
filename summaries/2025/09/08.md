# Activity Summary for 9/8/2025

## 10:37:22 AM
The code changes reflect the development of a React application with separate views for superadmins and psychologists.

**`MoodJournal.jsx` (9/8/2025, 10:11:03 AM):** This file introduces a mood tracking component.  It includes features for adding, editing, deleting, and toggling the active status of mood entries.  Data is stored in `localStorage` using `STORAGE_KEY_MOOD_TRACKER`, with fallback to `mockMoodTrackerInit` data if no local storage entry exists.  The component uses pagination, filtering (by user ID and mood), and a confirmation modal for deletion.


**`App.jsx` (9/8/2025, 10:11:43 AM & 9/8/2025, 10:12:25 AM):** This file defines the application's routing.  It uses `react-router-dom` to manage navigation between pages. A `ProtectedRoute` component ensures only authenticated users with appropriate roles (`superadmin` or `psychologist`) can access protected routes.  The initial version is missing a route for `/mood-journal`, which is added in the second commit at 10:12:25 AM. The application includes routes for login, password reset, a dashboard, user and category management, anonymous users, user details, settings, psychologist profiles, sessions, content management, reports, support, and a mood journal.  Routing is configured to redirect users to the appropriate dashboard based on their role.


**`Sidebar.jsx` (9/8/2025, 10:12:41 AM):** This file implements a sidebar component used in the application's layout.  It dynamically renders navigation items based on the user's role.  It also includes a notification panel with sample notifications and settings, and a logout functionality that removes user data from `localStorage`.  The navigation links are styled using tailwind CSS.  The sidebar includes a notification badge and a notification panel that is toggled by a button.  The notification panel lists unread and read notifications.

The provided code log shows two entries for the file `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Manmitar\kidmantree\src\Pages\MoodJournal.jsx`, both at timestamps 9/8/2025, with a difference of 34 seconds between them.  The code itself is identical in both entries.  The file contains React code for a mood tracker application.  The code includes components for displaying mood entries in a table (`MoodRow`), a form for adding or editing entries (`MoodForm`), a modal for confirming deletion (`ConfirmDeleteModal`), and the main application component (`AdminMoodTracker`).  `AdminMoodTracker` manages state using hooks such as `useState` and `useMemo`, fetching and saving data to local storage using `localStorage` with the key `"mock_mood_tracker"`.  The application supports filtering, pagination, and updating the active status of entries.  There are no apparent functional differences between the two log entries.
