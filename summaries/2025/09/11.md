# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 12:21:25 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `authController.js` file between 12:01:53 AM and 12:19:50 AM on September 11, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout—handling user signup, login, OTP verification, and admin invites—but there are several key changes:

* **JWT Token Generation:** The most significant change is the addition of JWT (JSON Web Token) generation and inclusion within the response of `verifyEmailOTP` and is likely added to `login` as well (though the final log entry is truncated).  Initially, the controller lacked token generation for email verification;  this was added using the `jsonwebtoken` library, configured via a `jwtConfig` module (imported at 12:18:41 AM).  This significantly improves security and enables proper authentication.

* **Minor Updates:** There are numerous minor edits throughout the log entries. These seem to primarily involve formatting and are not functionally significant.

* **`authController.js` Updates Summary:** The `authController.js` file consistently manages user authentication and authorization.  All its functions handle error responses using a consistent `errorResponse` function and success responses using `successResponse` function.  The file uses input validation (`signupSchema`, `loginSchema`, `otpSchema`) and logging (`logger`).  The addition of JWT token generation at 12:18:41 AM is the most substantial update.

* **`authRoutes.js` Update:** A single change at 12:11:17 AM to `authRoutes.js` defines Express.js routes for the authentication controller's methods, distinguishing between public and protected (authenticated) routes.  Admin routes are protected further by an authorization middleware.

* **`openapi.yaml` Update:**  A single update at 12:04:55 AM to `openapi.yaml` is an OpenAPI specification file describing the API endpoints. This update describes the API endpoints including user authentication (signup, login, OTP verification), parent consent flow, and admin invitation.  It details request and response structures, parameters, and authentication schemes.


The changes demonstrate iterative development, with the JWT integration being a crucial improvement to the authentication system.  The consistent use of helper functions and error handling indicates good coding practices.


## 9:52:38 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `ParentConsent.js` and `openapi.yaml`.

`ParentConsent.js` (9/11/2025, 12:22:25 AM): This file defines a Mongoose schema for `ParentConsent`.  The schema includes fields for `userId`, `parentEmail`, `parentContact`, verification statuses (`emailVerified`, `contactVerified`, `isVerified`), verification timestamps and OTP details with attempts for both email and contact verification.  This suggests the implementation of parent consent verification for users.


`openapi.yaml` (9/11/2025, 12:22:35 AM and 9/11/2025, 12:22:50 AM): This file is an OpenAPI specification for a Mental Health Platform API.  The two updates show the evolution of the API documentation. The first update details API endpoints for user authentication (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, OTP verification, and resend), parent consent initiation and verification (`/auth/parent/init`, `/auth/parent/verify-otp`), posts (`/posts`), mood logging (`/moods/log`).  The second update adds an endpoint for submitting a feeling (`/feelings/today`).  Both updates consistently define request bodies, responses (including success/error handling using `ApiResponse` and `ErrorResponse` schemas), and security using BearerAuth (JWT). The API models various data structures, including `User`, `Post`, `MoodLog`, `Psychologist`, `Appointment`, and `Poll`, demonstrating a comprehensive design.  The changes between the two `openapi.yaml` entries are minor; the second version simply adds a new endpoint (`/feelings/today`) for logging feelings.  Both versions extensively use references (`$ref`) for reusable schema definitions, improving maintainability.


## 10:13:40 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `WEEKLY_7.html`, a weekly newsletter's HTML code.  The main changes revolve around the content of the newsletter itself, specifically the titles and descriptions of featured blog posts.

The initial version (9:13:57 AM) featured a blog post titled "7 Press Release Types Every Brand Should Master (with Examples)".  Subsequent revisions (9:14:20 AM, 9:14:36 AM, 9:14:59 AM, 9:15:09 AM, 9:15:26 AM, 9:16:00 AM, 9:17:06 AM, 9:17:27 AM, 9:21:55 AM, 9:22:32 AM, 9:24:08 AM, 9:24:31 AM, 9:24:48 AM) modified this to "7 Newsletters Every PR & Comms Pro Should Subscribe To," refining its description over several iterations, adding more detail and context.  A second blog post, initially titled "Outreach Errors That Cost Brands Coverage" remained largely unchanged throughout the revisions but its description was improved.  Finally, another revision (9:30:39 AM, 9:31:01 AM, 9:32:03 AM)  changed the second blog post's title to "From Playing Catch-Up to Setting the Agenda: How to Shift From Reactive to Proactive PR",  and the  first blog post’s link was modified from `/blog/11` to `/blog/9`. A final minor edit at 9:32:03 AM added padding to a paragraph in the first blog post's description.

The HTML structure and styling remained consistent throughout all revisions; only the text content of the blog post descriptions changed. There's a clear pattern of iterative improvement to the newsletter's text, refining the blog post descriptions for better clarity and engagement. The majority of changes occurred within a relatively short timeframe between 9:14 AM and 9:17 AM.


## 11:09:58 AM
The log shows changes to two files within the `Skribe-Backend` project.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts`**

This file, modified at 10:10:46 AM on September 11, 2025, contains an Axios instance configuration for making API calls.  Key features include:

*   **Multiple Base URLs:** The code shows commented-out base URLs, suggesting experimentation with different environments (localhost, beta, production, and a temporary URL).  The final choice uses a dynamically determined base URL from the `config` module.
*   **Authentication Interceptors:**  The code implements request and response interceptors for handling authentication tokens.  It includes logic for refreshing access tokens when they expire, using a refresh token.  It also includes error handling for network errors and expired sessions, redirecting to the login page on session expiry.  `Alert.success` is used for displaying notifications to the user.
*   **Token Management:**  The code relies on a `TokenService` for managing access and refresh tokens stored locally.



**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\router\routes.tsx`**

This file was modified twice:  first at 10:13:42 AM and then at 10:31:36 AM on September 11, 2025.  It defines React Router routes for the application.  The updates are primarily additions of new routes, specifically for features related to:

*   **Extensive Application Features:** The file includes routes for a wide range of application features, including pages for analytics, finance, crypto, various application components (tabs, modals, etc.), data tables, user management (profiles, accounts, registration, customer management), settings, journalist management (adding, editing, auto-building), SkribeExtra and Skribe365 management, data dumps, outlets, monthly and client reports, blog management, career pages, and authentication.
*   **Roles and Permissions (Potential):**  The `Roles` enum suggests the potential for implementing role-based access control, although the commented-out `roles` attribute in some routes indicates this feature is incomplete or not fully implemented at the time of these commits.
*   **Code Changes Between Revisions:** The second commit to this file (at 10:31:36 AM) added `HR` to the `Roles` enum.  No other significant structural changes were detected between the two commits to this file.  This suggests that the main change was adding the HR role to the system.
