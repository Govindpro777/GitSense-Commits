# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 12:21:25 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `authController.js` file between 12:01:53 AM and 12:19:50 AM on September 11, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout—handling user signup, login, OTP verification, and admin invites—but there are several key changes:

* **JWT Token Generation:** The most significant change is the addition of JWT (JSON Web Token) generation and inclusion within the response of `verifyEmailOTP` and is likely added to `login` as well (though the final log entry is truncated).  Initially, the controller lacked token generation for email verification;  this was added using the `jsonwebtoken` library, configured via a `jwtConfig` module (imported at 12:18:41 AM).  This significantly improves security and enables proper authentication.

* **Minor Updates:** There are numerous minor edits throughout the log entries. These seem to primarily involve formatting and are not functionally significant.

* **`authController.js` Updates Summary:** The `authController.js` file consistently manages user authentication and authorization.  All its functions handle error responses using a consistent `errorResponse` function and success responses using `successResponse` function.  The file uses input validation (`signupSchema`, `loginSchema`, `otpSchema`) and logging (`logger`).  The addition of JWT token generation at 12:18:41 AM is the most substantial update.

* **`authRoutes.js` Update:** A single change at 12:11:17 AM to `authRoutes.js` defines Express.js routes for the authentication controller's methods, distinguishing between public and protected (authenticated) routes.  Admin routes are protected further by an authorization middleware.

* **`openapi.yaml` Update:**  A single update at 12:04:55 AM to `openapi.yaml` is an OpenAPI specification file describing the API endpoints. This update describes the API endpoints including user authentication (signup, login, OTP verification), parent consent flow, and admin invitation.  It details request and response structures, parameters, and authentication schemes.


The changes demonstrate iterative development, with the JWT integration being a crucial improvement to the authentication system.  The consistent use of helper functions and error handling indicates good coding practices.


## 9:52:38 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `ParentConsent.js` and `openapi.yaml`.

`ParentConsent.js` (9/11/2025, 12:22:25 AM): This file defines a Mongoose schema for `ParentConsent`.  The schema includes fields for `userId`, `parentEmail`, `parentContact`, verification statuses (`emailVerified`, `contactVerified`, `isVerified`), verification timestamps and OTP details with attempts for both email and contact verification.  This suggests the implementation of parent consent verification for users.


`openapi.yaml` (9/11/2025, 12:22:35 AM and 9/11/2025, 12:22:50 AM): This file is an OpenAPI specification for a Mental Health Platform API.  The two updates show the evolution of the API documentation. The first update details API endpoints for user authentication (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`, OTP verification, and resend), parent consent initiation and verification (`/auth/parent/init`, `/auth/parent/verify-otp`), posts (`/posts`), mood logging (`/moods/log`).  The second update adds an endpoint for submitting a feeling (`/feelings/today`).  Both updates consistently define request bodies, responses (including success/error handling using `ApiResponse` and `ErrorResponse` schemas), and security using BearerAuth (JWT). The API models various data structures, including `User`, `Post`, `MoodLog`, `Psychologist`, `Appointment`, and `Poll`, demonstrating a comprehensive design.  The changes between the two `openapi.yaml` entries are minor; the second version simply adds a new endpoint (`/feelings/today`) for logging feelings.  Both versions extensively use references (`$ref`) for reusable schema definitions, improving maintainability.
