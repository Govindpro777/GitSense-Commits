# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 9:43:14 AM
The primary change on September 25th, 2025, at 9:27:11 AM involved the `User.js` model file within the `kidmantree-backend` project.  This update significantly modified the `User` schema in the MongoDB database.  Key additions include fields for email and contact verification (`isEmailVerified`, `isContactVerified`), user roles with an enum (user, admin, superadmin, psychologist),  a `tempToken` field (likely for password resets or verification), and  references to `ParentConsent` and `NotificationPrefs` models via ObjectId.  The schema also incorporates a nested `profile` object containing avatar, bio, interests, and emergency contact details.  Validation rules were implemented for various fields (e.g., minimum length for name and password, age range).  Finally, a sparse index was created for the `tempToken` field for efficient lookups.
