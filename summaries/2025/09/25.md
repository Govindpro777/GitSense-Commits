# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 9:43:14 AM
The primary change on September 25th, 2025, at 9:27:11 AM involved the `User.js` model file within the `kidmantree-backend` project.  This update significantly modified the `User` schema in the MongoDB database.  Key additions include fields for email and contact verification (`isEmailVerified`, `isContactVerified`), user roles with an enum (user, admin, superadmin, psychologist),  a `tempToken` field (likely for password resets or verification), and  references to `ParentConsent` and `NotificationPrefs` models via ObjectId.  The schema also incorporates a nested `profile` object containing avatar, bio, interests, and emergency contact details.  Validation rules were implemented for various fields (e.g., minimum length for name and password, age range).  Finally, a sparse index was created for the `tempToken` field for efficient lookups.


## 9:43:18 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files, `check.html` and `check2.html`, between September 24th and 25th, 2025.

`check.html` was updated once on September 24th, 2025 at 10:54:55 PM. This file appears to be a newsletter template, displaying journalist moves and changes categorized by industry (Business & Economy, Technology, Legal & Administration, Sports, Defence & Security, Current Affairs, City & General, Health & Wellness).  Each entry includes the journalist's name, new role, organization, contact information, and date.

`check2.html` underwent several revisions on September 25th, 2025, between 9:09:10 AM and 9:39:34 AM.  This file seems to be a different newsletter, focusing on "Chai Time" updates including PR and communications news.  The content is presented in a shorter format than `check.html`, with articles linked to a "Read More" section.  The most significant changes in `check2.html` involved the source path of the logo image.  Initially, it points to `https://app.goskribe.com/mailer/logo_black.png`, then to `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/logo_black.png`,  `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/bulb2.png`,  `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/skribeNew.png`, and finally settles on `https://storage.googleapis.com/skribe-media-prod/mailerimages/logo_black.png`. There are also changes to the image source within the articles themselves, shifting from a Googleusercontent URL to a `beta-app.goskribe.com` URL, and then finally to a `.jpeg` rather than a `.png` file.  The content itself remains largely consistent across the revisions.


## 10:43:15 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ChaiTime.html` on September 25th, 2025.  The primary changes involve minor adjustments to the HTML structure and styling.

Specifically, between 9:53:45 AM and 9:54:37 AM, the margin style for the logo image was modified from `margin: 30px 20px` to `margin: 30px 20px 0px 20px`.  A subsequent change at 9:54:57 AM further refined the logo's margin to `margin: 30px 20px 10px 20px`. These modifications suggest iterative improvements to the visual layout of the logo within the email template.

The content of the email, featuring news snippets on PR and appointments within the communications industry, remained consistent across all revisions.  The email consistently uses similar styling for headlines, subheadings, and body text, indicating a consistent design language.  The links to "Read More" articles also remained unchanged.
