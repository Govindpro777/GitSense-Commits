# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 9:43:14 AM
The primary change on September 25th, 2025, at 9:27:11 AM involved the `User.js` model file within the `kidmantree-backend` project.  This update significantly modified the `User` schema in the MongoDB database.  Key additions include fields for email and contact verification (`isEmailVerified`, `isContactVerified`), user roles with an enum (user, admin, superadmin, psychologist),  a `tempToken` field (likely for password resets or verification), and  references to `ParentConsent` and `NotificationPrefs` models via ObjectId.  The schema also incorporates a nested `profile` object containing avatar, bio, interests, and emergency contact details.  Validation rules were implemented for various fields (e.g., minimum length for name and password, age range).  Finally, a sparse index was created for the `tempToken` field for efficient lookups.


## 9:43:18 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files, `check.html` and `check2.html`, between September 24th and 25th, 2025.

`check.html` was updated once on September 24th, 2025 at 10:54:55 PM. This file appears to be a newsletter template, displaying journalist moves and changes categorized by industry (Business & Economy, Technology, Legal & Administration, Sports, Defence & Security, Current Affairs, City & General, Health & Wellness).  Each entry includes the journalist's name, new role, organization, contact information, and date.

`check2.html` underwent several revisions on September 25th, 2025, between 9:09:10 AM and 9:39:34 AM.  This file seems to be a different newsletter, focusing on "Chai Time" updates including PR and communications news.  The content is presented in a shorter format than `check.html`, with articles linked to a "Read More" section.  The most significant changes in `check2.html` involved the source path of the logo image.  Initially, it points to `https://app.goskribe.com/mailer/logo_black.png`, then to `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/logo_black.png`,  `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/bulb2.png`,  `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/skribeNew.png`, and finally settles on `https://storage.googleapis.com/skribe-media-prod/mailerimages/logo_black.png`. There are also changes to the image source within the articles themselves, shifting from a Googleusercontent URL to a `beta-app.goskribe.com` URL, and then finally to a `.jpeg` rather than a `.png` file.  The content itself remains largely consistent across the revisions.
