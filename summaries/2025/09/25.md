# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 9:43:14 AM
The primary change on September 25th, 2025, at 9:27:11 AM involved the `User.js` model file within the `kidmantree-backend` project.  This update significantly modified the `User` schema in the MongoDB database.  Key additions include fields for email and contact verification (`isEmailVerified`, `isContactVerified`), user roles with an enum (user, admin, superadmin, psychologist),  a `tempToken` field (likely for password resets or verification), and  references to `ParentConsent` and `NotificationPrefs` models via ObjectId.  The schema also incorporates a nested `profile` object containing avatar, bio, interests, and emergency contact details.  Validation rules were implemented for various fields (e.g., minimum length for name and password, age range).  Finally, a sparse index was created for the `tempToken` field for efficient lookups.


## 9:43:18 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files, `check.html` and `check2.html`, between September 24th and 25th, 2025.

`check.html` was updated once on September 24th, 2025 at 10:54:55 PM. This file appears to be a newsletter template, displaying journalist moves and changes categorized by industry (Business & Economy, Technology, Legal & Administration, Sports, Defence & Security, Current Affairs, City & General, Health & Wellness).  Each entry includes the journalist's name, new role, organization, contact information, and date.

`check2.html` underwent several revisions on September 25th, 2025, between 9:09:10 AM and 9:39:34 AM.  This file seems to be a different newsletter, focusing on "Chai Time" updates including PR and communications news.  The content is presented in a shorter format than `check.html`, with articles linked to a "Read More" section.  The most significant changes in `check2.html` involved the source path of the logo image.  Initially, it points to `https://app.goskribe.com/mailer/logo_black.png`, then to `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/logo_black.png`,  `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/bulb2.png`,  `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/skribeNew.png`, and finally settles on `https://storage.googleapis.com/skribe-media-prod/mailerimages/logo_black.png`. There are also changes to the image source within the articles themselves, shifting from a Googleusercontent URL to a `beta-app.goskribe.com` URL, and then finally to a `.jpeg` rather than a `.png` file.  The content itself remains largely consistent across the revisions.


## 10:43:15 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ChaiTime.html` on September 25th, 2025.  The primary changes involve minor adjustments to the HTML structure and styling.

Specifically, between 9:53:45 AM and 9:54:37 AM, the margin style for the logo image was modified from `margin: 30px 20px` to `margin: 30px 20px 0px 20px`.  A subsequent change at 9:54:57 AM further refined the logo's margin to `margin: 30px 20px 10px 20px`. These modifications suggest iterative improvements to the visual layout of the logo within the email template.

The content of the email, featuring news snippets on PR and appointments within the communications industry, remained consistent across all revisions.  The email consistently uses similar styling for headlines, subheadings, and body text, indicating a consistent design language.  The links to "Read More" articles also remained unchanged.


## 2:43:14 PM
The OpenAPI specification file (`openapi.yaml`) was updated on September 25th, 2025, at 12:46:34 PM.  This update defines the API for a mental health platform, specifying various endpoints and data structures.  The API includes authentication (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`), OTP verification (`/auth/verify-contact-otp`, `/auth/verify-email-otp`, `/auth/resend-otp`), and likely data models for Users, Posts, Mood Logs, Psychologists, Appointments, and Polls.  The specification uses a comprehensive schema definition for each data structure, detailing properties, types, and constraints (e.g., enums for user roles, mood tags, and appointment statuses).  The file also includes details for various HTTP response codes (200, 201, 400) with descriptions and example responses using a consistent `ApiResponse` and `ErrorResponse` schema.  The API uses JWT authentication ("BearerAuth").  Two server URLs are defined, likely for development and production environments.


## 3:13:33 PM
The log shows several HTML email template updates on September 25th, 2025.

`Skribe365.html` was updated twice.  The first version (2:14:19 PM) is a newsletter showcasing journalist moves and changes categorized by industry sections (Business & Economy, Technology, Legal & Administration, Sports, Defence & Security, Current Affairs, City & General, Health & Wellness). Each entry includes the journalist's name, new role, publication, location, contact information, and X handle (if available). The second version (2:22:56 PM) appears to be identical to the first, suggesting no functional changes were made between the two commits.

`WEEKLY_7.html` (2:16:05 PM) contains a weekly newsletter template with a different design and content structure than `Skribe365.html`. It features a two-column layout, highlighting a "Blog of the week" section with links to two articles ("Track These 7 PR KPIs to Show Real Impact" and "Outreach Errors That Cost Brands Coverage"), a call to action for press release distribution, and a demo booking.  The styling is distinct, utilizing different fonts and color schemes.

`mailer2.html` (2:40:49 PM) is a simpler template, likely a contact card email. It displays contact information for Dr. Meenakshi Rawani, including her title, email, website, and phone number, and utilizes a different font style compared to the other files.


All HTML files utilize inline CSS for styling and include links to external Google Fonts.  There's a recurring use of tables for layout, a common practice in email design.  The timestamps indicate a period of active development and deployment of email templates within a short timeframe.


## 3:43:14 PM
The primary change on September 25th, 2025, at 3:12:04 PM involved the `app.js` file within the `kidmantree-backend` application.  This commit focused on enhancing security and improving CORS configuration.  Specifically, the hardcoded CORS origin was replaced with a function that dynamically checks if the origin is allowed, using an array `allowedOrigins`  containing `'http://localhost:3000'` and `'http://localhost:5173'`.  Rate limiting was also implemented using `express-rate-limit`, with configurable `windowMs` and `max` values based on environment variables.  The rest of the file shows standard middleware setup including `helmet`, `cors`, `morgan`, `compression`, body parsing, route definition (`/api`), swagger documentation setup, and error handling.  The health check endpoint was retained.


## 4:13:32 PM
On September 25th, 2025, at 4:11:08 PM, the `WEEKLY_7.html` file was updated.  This file is an HTML email newsletter. The update involved extensive styling using inline CSS to control the layout, fonts ("Poppins" and "League Spartan"), colors (#002b5b, #f5f5f5, #374151), and responsiveness using `clamp()` for various elements like text size and image widths.  The email features a two-column layout, uses images sourced from `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/`, and includes links to blog posts ("Track These 7 PR KPIs to Show Real Impact" and "Outreach Errors That Cost Brands Coverage") and scheduling links (`calendly.com`).  The content focuses on PR strategies, KPIs, outreach best practices, and promoting Skribe's services (press release distribution and free demo).  Media queries are implemented for better mobile responsiveness.  The overall structure relies heavily on nested tables for layout.


## 5:13:43 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several HTML files related to email newsletters from Goskribe, a media relations company.  The changes primarily focus on updating image source paths and, in one instance, slightly modifying the newsletter content.

`WEEKLY_7.html` (9/25/2025, 4:19:42 PM): This file contains the HTML code for a weekly newsletter. The initial revision establishes the overall structure and styling, using inline CSS and external stylesheets for fonts.  The content includes a blog summary section and promotional material for Skribe's services. No further updates are present in the log.

`Skribe365.html` (9/25/2025, 4:22:17 PM, 4:33:34 PM, 4:33:54 PM): This file underwent several revisions. The primary changes involved modifying the image source for the logo (`skribe365.png`) from `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/skribe365.png` to `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/skribe365.png`. The content of this newsletter showcases journalist updates categorized by industry (Business & Economy, Technology, Legal & Administration, Sports, Defence & Security, Current Affairs, City & General, and Health & Wellness).  The content itself remains largely unchanged across the revisions.

`Skribe4.html` (9/25/2025, 4:35:30 PM, 4:44:06 PM, 4:47:25 PM, 4:49:08 PM, 4:49:56 PM, 4:50:32 PM): This file was modified extensively. The most significant changes involved image source updates, similar to `Skribe365.html`, altering the paths from `beta-app.goskribe.com` to `www.goskribe.com/mailerimages`.  This newsletter focuses on comparing "Paid Distribution" and "Organic Articles" as media strategies, presenting their respective advantages and a comparison table. The content remained consistent across the numerous revisions, except for the image path changes.

`Skribe3.html` (9/25/2025, 4:45:29 PM, 4:46:13 PM, 5:08:21 PM, 5:08:58 PM):  Similar to `Skribe4.html`, this newsletter also experienced multiple revisions with the primary changes being the consistent updates to image paths. This newsletter centers on Skribe's media coverage solutions, promoting both paid distribution and organic placement options. The content remained unchanged beyond the image source adjustments.

`mailer1.html` (9/25/2025, 5:10:03 PM, 5:10:19 PM): This file also had its image paths updated from `app.goskribe.com` to `www.goskribe.com/mailerimages`. This newsletter displays news articles related to Biocon, separated into "Industry" and "Research and Treatment" categories. The content remained unchanged except for image path modifications.

A clear pattern emerges:  the most common changes involved consistently updating the image sources across all newsletters to a new centralized location (`www.goskribe.com/mailerimages`).  This suggests a reorganization of the company's image storage and asset management.  The content within each newsletter remained largely stable across revisions.
