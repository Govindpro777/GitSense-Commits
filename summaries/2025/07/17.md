# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 10:21:05 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Choose.jsx` between 9:55 AM and 10:05 AM on July 17, 2025.  These revisions primarily involve adjustments to the styling and dimensions of UI elements within the component.  Specifically, the heading sizes (`h1` and `p` tags) were reduced in several iterations.  There were also several changes to the `width` and `height` properties of the divs containing the Skribe and Socion logos, reducing their size over multiple commits.  The most significant change affecting the Socion logo section occurred around 10:05 AM, where the width of the containing div was drastically reduced from `200px` to `10px` and subsequently reverted back to `170px` within a minute.  The `ChooseLogin.jsx` file was modified once at 9:56 AM, implementing cookie-based role checks for redirection purposes.  This file uses Next.js's `cookies` and `redirect` functions to manage user access based on their role, redirecting users without the "Social" role to the "/dashboard" route.


## 2:28:15 PM
The log shows code changes in two files within the `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Socion\social` directory on July 17, 2025.


**`constants.js` (2:24:17 PM):** This file was updated to define numerous constants, primarily API endpoints.  The endpoints are categorized (AUTH, FREEBIES ACCOUNT, REPORTS API CALL, POST TRACKING API, ANNOUNCEMENT STRIP, and SOCIAL CAMPAIGN API).  All the API endpoints seem to be built using a base URL (`Url_V1`) retrieved from environment variables, suggesting a modular approach to managing API configurations.  Specific constants include URLs for login, user information retrieval, OTP generation, password reset, campaign creation, and various social campaign-related operations.  The `OUTLETPATH` constant is the only one not using the base URL from environment variables, suggesting it might point to a different service.


**`Summary.jsx` (2:24:29 PM and 2:24:40 PM):**  This React component displays a summary of social campaigns. The first commit was a commented-out version of the component. The second commit (2:24:40 PM) shows a fully functional component which was significantly refactored. Key improvements include:

* **Component Rename:** The component was renamed from `Summary` to `SocialSummary`.
* **Implementation of Row Expansion:** The component now allows expanding rows to show details, using the `expandedRows` state and `FiChevronDown`/`FiChevronRight` icons.
* **Improved Status Filtering:** The filtering logic changed from using `isSent` to using a dedicated `status` field in the campaign data.  Status options are now "All," "Draft," and "Sent."
* **Search Functionality Enhancement:**  Added client-side search with a debounce mechanism to prevent excessive API calls. A minimum of 3 characters is required for search.  An error message is shown if fewer than 3 characters are entered.
* **Pagination and Infinite Scroll:** Implemented infinite scrolling using `nextPageToken` to load more campaign data as the user scrolls.
* **Error Handling:** Includes error handling within the `getAllCampaignData` function, logging errors to the console.
* **Date Range Filtering:** Allows filtering campaigns by start and end dates.
* **UI Improvements:**  The UI was updated to include visual elements like icons (e.g., eye icon, search icon), creator image display, and better loading indicators.
* **Removal of unnecessary code:** The commented-out code from the initial commit was removed.


In summary, the changes reflect the development of a React component to display and filter social media campaign data, fetching data from various API endpoints defined in `constants.js`.  The `Summary.jsx` component underwent a major revision, enhancing functionality, UI, and user experience. The use of environment variables for API URLs in `constants.js` promotes maintainability and flexibility.


## 3:28:14 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Summary.jsx`, a React component displaying campaign summaries.  The primary changes revolve around the component's UI and data fetching logic.

The initial version (3:05:11 PM) is largely commented out, indicating a work-in-progress state. The subsequent versions (3:05:35 PM, 3:08:54 PM, 3:15:08 PM, 3:16:16 PM) progressively add functionality, primarily focusing on the visual presentation of campaign data within a table.  These versions refine the search functionality, adding client-side filtering based on status (All, Draft, Sent),  start and end dates, and a debounced search implementation to avoid excessive API calls.  They also include infinite scroll functionality to load more data as the user scrolls down.  Error handling is implemented using `useNotification` for insufficient search terms.


At 3:15:24 PM, a separate file, `constants.js`, is updated.  This file defines various API endpoints, including `GET_ALL_CAMPAIGN_SUMMARY` which is used by `Summary.jsx` to fetch campaign data.


The final significant change (3:21:30 PM) introduces expandable rows to the campaign summary table, allowing for more detailed view of child campaigns. The component is renamed from `Summary` to `SocialSummary` and the search input is styled using `border` properties.  The "No Results Found" message is improved to only appear if filters (search or dates) are used, otherwise it displays "No Campaigns Created Yet".  A final version with all the code commented out appeared at 3:23:18 PM.


Throughout the revisions, the core functionality remains consistent: fetching and displaying campaign data with filtering and pagination, but the UI and user experience have been iteratively enhanced. The use of functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`), and asynchronous operations (`async/await`) are prominent features of the code.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes suggests a focus on styling and responsiveness.
