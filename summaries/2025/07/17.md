# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 10:21:05 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Choose.jsx` between 9:55 AM and 10:05 AM on July 17, 2025.  These revisions primarily involve adjustments to the styling and dimensions of UI elements within the component.  Specifically, the heading sizes (`h1` and `p` tags) were reduced in several iterations.  There were also several changes to the `width` and `height` properties of the divs containing the Skribe and Socion logos, reducing their size over multiple commits.  The most significant change affecting the Socion logo section occurred around 10:05 AM, where the width of the containing div was drastically reduced from `200px` to `10px` and subsequently reverted back to `170px` within a minute.  The `ChooseLogin.jsx` file was modified once at 9:56 AM, implementing cookie-based role checks for redirection purposes.  This file uses Next.js's `cookies` and `redirect` functions to manage user access based on their role, redirecting users without the "Social" role to the "/dashboard" route.
