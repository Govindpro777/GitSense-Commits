# Activity Summary for 7/23/2025

## 10:13:57 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EmailPreview.jsx` between 9:29 AM and 10:05 AM on July 23, 2025.  The core functionality of `EmailPreview.jsx` remained consistent:  displaying and allowing editing of an email preview for a campaign.  The changes primarily centered around the `generateDeliverableTable` function within `EmailPreview.jsx`.

Initially, `generateDeliverableTable` was commented out. It was then uncommented and modified to create a Markdown-style table of deliverables, including a description field.  Subsequent revisions focused on refining the styling of horizontal lines within this table, adjusting the margin values in the `hr` tag's style attribute in several iterations,  trying different margin values (`margin: 8px 0;`, `margin: 2px 0;`, `margin: 2px -5px;`, `margin: 2px -10px 0 -10px;`, `margin: 2px -9px 0 -9px;`) and border colors (`#ccc`, `#FFFFFF`). The final version uses `margin: 2px -9px 0 -9px;` and `#ccc` for the border color.

The `htmlToPlainText.jsx` file was modified once at 9:25:56 AM, adding a function to convert HTML to plain text. This function is used in `EmailPreview.jsx` to convert the campaign brief from HTML to plain text for display and editing.  The `htmlToPlainText` function handles various HTML tags such as `<p>`, `<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<br>`, and `<div>`, converting them to plain text with appropriate line breaks and list formatting.

There is no significant pattern besides the iterative refinement of the `generateDeliverableTable` function's styling. The other file changes are all related to the same component (`EmailPreview.jsx`).


## 11:12:54 AM
The log shows multiple edits to two HTML files, `index3.html` and `index4.html`, between 10:25 AM and 11:08 AM on July 23, 2025.  Both files are email templates, likely for marketing purposes.

`index3.html` (Agency-focused):  The primary changes in `index3.html` involve refining the main heading and introductory paragraphs to better target a PR agency audience.  Early versions focused on "pricing transparency" and broad distribution, later iterations emphasized the speed and control offered for time-sensitive campaigns.  The final edits around 11:08 AM involved minor structural changes, moving an image to a different column and making slight adjustments to the paragraph styling and section headings.  The overall style and content remain consistent; changes are iterative refinements.

`index4.html` (Enterprise-focused): This file underwent similar refinement but with a different focus. Initial versions highlighted "guaranteed media coverage," "full control," and "transparent pricing."  Later versions, starting around 10:41 AM, shifted the emphasis to the speed and efficiency of the service, particularly for time-sensitive announcements like product launches and crisis communications. The edits at 10:45 AM and later iterations focus on using bullet points to highlight key features (indicated by âœ… checkmarks) and restructuring the paragraph and list order to enhance readability and impact.  The content consistently promotes the speed and control advantages of Skribe's paid PR service to enterprise clients.

Both files share the same basic structure, incorporating a header image, a main message section, a features section, a call to action (WhatsApp, Calendly, and a PDF link), example placements, and a footer with social media links. The consistent use of the same images and links across both files suggest a coordinated marketing strategy.  The unsubscribe link in the final version of both files utilizes a dynamic placeholder, `<%asm_group_unsubscribe_raw_url%>`, indicating email campaign automation.


## 11:13:52 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EmailPreview.jsx` between 10:16 AM and 10:19 AM on July 23, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent:  a React component for previewing and editing email content related to an Instagram campaign.  The component fetches draft data using `userService.get` and allows users to edit the campaign brief and email signature.  Changes are saved via `userService.put`.


The primary changes revolve around the `generateDeliverableTable` function and the styling/display of attachments.

* **10:16 AM:** Initial version of `generateDeliverableTable`.  It creates a markdown table of deliverables, but the description lacks proper formatting of line breaks within each item.

* **10:17 AM - 10:19 AM:** Several minor edits to `generateDeliverableTable`.  The most significant change is the addition of `.sort((a, b) => a.boxNumber - b.boxNumber)` within the `deliverables` processing. This sorts the descriptions by box number before rendering.  There are also minor refinements to the styling of the horizontal lines within the description section of the table (`<hr>`), attempting to consistently space the lines with adjustments to the `margin` property.  The changes between these timestamps are very minor and might reflect iterative debugging of the horizontal rule styling in the `generateDeliverableTable` function.

* **10:17 AM:**  The UI was updated to display attachments.  The component now renders attachments from `draftData?.draftData?.attachments`, providing a visual representation and a "close" icon to allow for removal using `handleRemoveAttachment`.

The component consistently uses the `userService` for API interactions, and error handling is implemented throughout using `try...catch` blocks and the `useNotification` hook.  The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS.


## 12:12:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `index3.html` and one version of `index4.html` between 11:53 AM and 11:57 AM on July 23, 2025.  `index4.html` is an email template focused on enterprise clients, while `index3.html` targets advertising agencies.  Both templates feature similar structures, using tables for layout,  consistent styling with imported Google Fonts (`Poppins`, `League Spartan`, `Work Sans`), and identical social media links in the footer.

The major changes in `index3.html` revolve around the main heading's `margin` values.  These were slightly adjusted in each revision between 11:54 AM and 11:57 AM, suggesting fine-tuning of the header's positioning within the email layout.  The content itself remained largely consistent across all versions of `index3.html`, focused on highlighting the speed and control offered by Skribe's Paid PR service.  No significant content changes were observed in the `index4.html` file.


## 12:13:50 PM
The `EmailPreview.jsx` component underwent several updates between 11:20:59 AM and 11:21:20 AM on July 23, 2025.  The primary changes involve the handling and display of email signatures and the success message after saving.

Specifically,  a new text area for email signature input was added within the editing section of the component.  The `updateDraftData` function was modified to include the email signature in the update request, and the success notification message was changed to reflect this, now indicating both the campaign brief and email signature were updated successfully.  These changes happened in rapid succession, with each commit only a few seconds apart.  No structural changes to the component's overall layout were observed. The component continues to fetch draft data, generate an email template based on campaign brief and deliverables, allow attachment removal, and manage an editing mode.  The core logic of fetching data, generating the email preview, and handling edits remains consistent across the revisions.


## 1:46:00 PM
The code in `TawkMessenger.jsx` (modified 7/23/2025, 1:18:07 PM) implements a Tawk.to live chat widget.  The component fetches user information from `localStorage` on mount. This information (`name`, `email`, `phoneNumber`) is then used to set attributes on the Tawk.to widget, allowing for pre-populated user details.  Error handling is included for both fetching user info and setting Tawk attributes.  Initially, commented-out code suggests an earlier attempt to fetch user info via a `userService`, which was later replaced by using `localStorage`. The current implementation relies on the existence of a `userInfo` object in `localStorage`.  The `onLoad` callback of the `TawkLiveChat` component sets a state variable `isTawkLoaded` to true, enabling conditional rendering and attribute setting.
