# Activity Summary for 7/23/2025

## 10:13:57 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EmailPreview.jsx` between 9:29 AM and 10:05 AM on July 23, 2025.  The core functionality of `EmailPreview.jsx` remained consistent:  displaying and allowing editing of an email preview for a campaign.  The changes primarily centered around the `generateDeliverableTable` function within `EmailPreview.jsx`.

Initially, `generateDeliverableTable` was commented out. It was then uncommented and modified to create a Markdown-style table of deliverables, including a description field.  Subsequent revisions focused on refining the styling of horizontal lines within this table, adjusting the margin values in the `hr` tag's style attribute in several iterations,  trying different margin values (`margin: 8px 0;`, `margin: 2px 0;`, `margin: 2px -5px;`, `margin: 2px -10px 0 -10px;`, `margin: 2px -9px 0 -9px;`) and border colors (`#ccc`, `#FFFFFF`). The final version uses `margin: 2px -9px 0 -9px;` and `#ccc` for the border color.

The `htmlToPlainText.jsx` file was modified once at 9:25:56 AM, adding a function to convert HTML to plain text. This function is used in `EmailPreview.jsx` to convert the campaign brief from HTML to plain text for display and editing.  The `htmlToPlainText` function handles various HTML tags such as `<p>`, `<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<br>`, and `<div>`, converting them to plain text with appropriate line breaks and list formatting.

There is no significant pattern besides the iterative refinement of the `generateDeliverableTable` function's styling. The other file changes are all related to the same component (`EmailPreview.jsx`).
