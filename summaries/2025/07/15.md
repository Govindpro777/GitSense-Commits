# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 9:04:34 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `SocialSummary.jsx` between 7:32 AM and 7:44 AM on July 15, 2025.  These edits appear to be minor and likely related to debugging or very small UI adjustments, as the code remains largely unchanged across all revisions. No substantial functional changes are visible in the provided snippets.

A separate file, `Insights.jsx`, was also modified. This file, updated at 7:51 AM and 7:52 AM on the same day, appears to be a React component displaying influencer campaign data.  The changes between these two timestamps appear to be a correction in spelling ("Analyse" changed to "Analyze"). The component includes features such as:

*   A dropdown to filter campaigns.
*   Tables to display engaged and shortlisted influencers.
*   Buttons to add deliverables and engage offline.
*   UI elements indicating campaign status and influencer verification.

The `Insights.jsx` component showcases a well-structured UI with interactive elements and clear data presentation.  The changes made were minimal and primarily focused on correcting a typographical error.
