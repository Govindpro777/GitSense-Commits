# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 9:04:34 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `SocialSummary.jsx` between 7:32 AM and 7:44 AM on July 15, 2025.  These edits appear to be minor and likely related to debugging or very small UI adjustments, as the code remains largely unchanged across all revisions. No substantial functional changes are visible in the provided snippets.

A separate file, `Insights.jsx`, was also modified. This file, updated at 7:51 AM and 7:52 AM on the same day, appears to be a React component displaying influencer campaign data.  The changes between these two timestamps appear to be a correction in spelling ("Analyse" changed to "Analyze"). The component includes features such as:

*   A dropdown to filter campaigns.
*   Tables to display engaged and shortlisted influencers.
*   Buttons to add deliverables and engage offline.
*   UI elements indicating campaign status and influencer verification.

The `Insights.jsx` component showcases a well-structured UI with interactive elements and clear data presentation.  The changes made were minimal and primarily focused on correcting a typographical error.

The log shows several code changes across frontend and backend components of an application dealing with graphics orders and image search.

**`FileUploadModal.jsx` (Frontend):**  The component underwent significant changes, primarily between the first and second timestamps.  The entire component was commented out at 11:30:18 PM,  then fully restored at 11:39:17 PM.  This suggests a potential temporary removal or testing phase. The component handles file uploads (CAD, image, and text files).  It features file preview, removal, and upload functionality, interacting with both a main API (`baseUrl/api/v1/admin/fileupload`) and a secondary API (FastAPI, `IMAGE_SEARCH_API`). The commented-out code block, between 11:01:40 PM and 11:30:18 PM, indicates that a secondary API upload was implemented to send the first image and CAD file to a FastAPI endpoint `/v2/add`. This secondary upload was later commented out in the restored code. File names are renamed sequentially using a fetch call to retrieve existing image count from `/list`.


**`graphics.controller.js` (Backend):** This controller manages graphics-related operations.  There's an `exports.createOrder` function which is heavily modified across multiple timestamps.  Initially, it appears to have handled order creation with image uploads via `localFileUpload`. Later versions added validation for required fields (`requirements`, `dimensions`, `images`), and the ability to specify an existing `customerId` or create a new customer if one isn't provided.  The controller also interacts with `User`, `Order`, `WorkQueue`, `Notification`, and other models.  The `sendAssignmentNotification` function sends assignment notifications to users via WebSockets. The code uses `mongoose` for database interactions, `Agenda` for scheduling tasks, and `multer` for handling file uploads.  Multiple versions show the evolution of order creation, including a commented out, full implementation, and ongoing refinement of handling customer creation within the order creation flow. The addition of the `changes` array suggests the possibility of a future change tracking mechanism.



**`admin.routes.js` (Backend):** This file defines backend routes.  The most significant change is the adjustment of authorization using middleware functions (`auth`, `isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isGraphics`, `isCutout`, etc.).  This file manages routes related to leads, customers, orders, graphics processing, cutout operations, accounts and notifications.  The `add-to-db` route is updated at 7:15:31 AM, changing its authorization from `auth` and `isGraphics` to `auth` and `isSuperAdmin`.

**`ImageSearch.jsx` (Frontend):** This component is an image search interface. The file had several commits where it was completely commented out and then restored, suggesting phases of development or debugging. The component has functions to handle image uploads, adding images to a database, image search, and downloading files.   It uses pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities. The component interacts with the `API_BASE_URL` (FastAPI) for loading images and search functionality.  Error handling and auto-clearing of success/error messages are implemented.  Multiple versions show ongoing refinement of file upload and image search logic.  The image search functionality uses a similarity threshold.


**`auth.js` (Backend):** This middleware handles authentication and authorization. The primary change is a refinement to the `auth` middleware which now handles token retrieval from `req.headers["authorization"]`, and includes logic to handle Bearer token formatting.  Various other middleware functions (`isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isGraphics`, etc.) define access control based on user roles.  The changes improve robustness of token handling.


In summary, the codebase shows a system for managing graphics orders, including file uploads, processing, assignment to users, and image search functionality with sequential naming. There is extensive use of asynchronous operations and error handling. Multiple files show a pattern of complete commenting-out followed by restoration, indicating an iterative development style with potential testing and refactoring phases.  Authorization is heavily emphasized, with multiple middleware functions controlling access to different resources based on user roles.
