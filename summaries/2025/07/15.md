A separate file, `Insights.jsx`, was also modified. This file, updated at 7:51 AM and 7:52 AM on the same day, appears to be a React component displaying influencer campaign data.  The changes between these two timestamps appear to be a correction in spelling ("Analyse" changed to "Analyze"). The component includes features such as:

*   A dropdown to filter campaigns.
*   Tables to display engaged and shortlisted influencers.
*   Buttons to add deliverables and engage offline.
*   UI elements indicating campaign status and influencer verification.

The `Insights.jsx` component showcases a well-structured UI with interactive elements and clear data presentation.  The changes made were minimal and primarily focused on correcting a typographical error.


## 10:04:13 AM
The log shows several code changes across frontend and backend components of an application dealing with graphics orders and image search.

**`FileUploadModal.jsx` (Frontend):**  The component underwent significant changes, primarily between the first and second timestamps.  The entire component was commented out at 11:30:18 PM,  then fully restored at 11:39:17 PM.  This suggests a potential temporary removal or testing phase. The component handles file uploads (CAD, image, and text files).  It features file preview, removal, and upload functionality, interacting with both a main API (`baseUrl/api/v1/admin/fileupload`) and a secondary API (FastAPI, `IMAGE_SEARCH_API`). The commented-out code block, between 11:01:40 PM and 11:30:18 PM, indicates that a secondary API upload was implemented to send the first image and CAD file to a FastAPI endpoint `/v2/add`. This secondary upload was later commented out in the restored code. File names are renamed sequentially using a fetch call to retrieve existing image count from `/list`.


**`graphics.controller.js` (Backend):** This controller manages graphics-related operations.  There's an `exports.createOrder` function which is heavily modified across multiple timestamps.  Initially, it appears to have handled order creation with image uploads via `localFileUpload`. Later versions added validation for required fields (`requirements`, `dimensions`, `images`), and the ability to specify an existing `customerId` or create a new customer if one isn't provided.  The controller also interacts with `User`, `Order`, `WorkQueue`, `Notification`, and other models.  The `sendAssignmentNotification` function sends assignment notifications to users via WebSockets. The code uses `mongoose` for database interactions, `Agenda` for scheduling tasks, and `multer` for handling file uploads.  Multiple versions show the evolution of order creation, including a commented out, full implementation, and ongoing refinement of handling customer creation within the order creation flow. The addition of the `changes` array suggests the possibility of a future change tracking mechanism.



**`admin.routes.js` (Backend):** This file defines backend routes.  The most significant change is the adjustment of authorization using middleware functions (`auth`, `isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isGraphics`, `isCutout`, etc.).  This file manages routes related to leads, customers, orders, graphics processing, cutout operations, accounts and notifications.  The `add-to-db` route is updated at 7:15:31 AM, changing its authorization from `auth` and `isGraphics` to `auth` and `isSuperAdmin`.

**`ImageSearch.jsx` (Frontend):** This component is an image search interface. The file had several commits where it was completely commented out and then restored, suggesting phases of development or debugging. The component has functions to handle image uploads, adding images to a database, image search, and downloading files.   It uses pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities. The component interacts with the `API_BASE_URL` (FastAPI) for loading images and search functionality.  Error handling and auto-clearing of success/error messages are implemented.  Multiple versions show ongoing refinement of file upload and image search logic.  The image search functionality uses a similarity threshold.


**`auth.js` (Backend):** This middleware handles authentication and authorization. The primary change is a refinement to the `auth` middleware which now handles token retrieval from `req.headers["authorization"]`, and includes logic to handle Bearer token formatting.  Various other middleware functions (`isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isGraphics`, etc.) define access control based on user roles.  The changes improve robustness of token handling.


In summary, the codebase shows a system for managing graphics orders, including file uploads, processing, assignment to users, and image search functionality with sequential naming. There is extensive use of asynchronous operations and error handling. Multiple files show a pattern of complete commenting-out followed by restoration, indicating an iterative development style with potential testing and refactoring phases.  Authorization is heavily emphasized, with multiple middleware functions controlling access to different resources based on user roles.


## 12:51:08 PM
The log shows multiple React component file updates between 10:57 AM and 11:53 AM on July 15, 2025.  The majority of changes involve styling and structural modifications to existing components, rather than significant functional alterations.

`BlogDetails.jsx`: This component displays blog post details.  The update extensively refactors the rendering of blog post content based on the `post.type` property.  It introduces conditional rendering for different content structures ("Case-Study" vs. other types), including sections for challenges, advantages, turning points, outcomes, and lists with nested items. The styling is heavily focused on color schemes (`#115FD6`, `#01438D`, `#000000`, etc.) and responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes. A Twitter sharing functionality is also added.

`CTASection.jsx`: This component renders a call-to-action section with a form for collecting user information (name, email, organization, mobile, password).  The update includes styling changes and the removal of commented-out radio buttons for organization type.

`Hero.jsx`: This component is part of the social landing page and displays hero section content. The update involves styling modifications and the addition of buttons linking to "Get Early Access" and "Login" functionalities, along with image assets for background and influencers.

`SocialLandingPage.jsx`: This component orchestrates the social landing page, integrating the `Hero`, `WhyThisProduct`, `UseCases`, `Testimonials`, `CTASection`, and `Footer` components.  The update primarily involves adding the `ctaRef` and `scrollToCTA` functionalities for smooth scrolling to the CTA section.

`Insights.jsx`: This component presents a dashboard for influencer campaign insights, including tables, dropdowns, and interactive elements for adding and managing deliverables and engagement data. The update involves significant additions of features to the component.  These include: a dynamic dropdown for filtering campaigns, adding and removing rows in deliverables and engagement tables, interactive table updates, and modal pop-ups for adding deliverables or handling offline engagement.  The component also displays lists of engaged and shortlisted influencers.

`Stats.jsx`: This component shows campaign statistics using charts (pie and line) and tables.  The update includes styling modifications, particularly related to chart and table presentation. There are no functional changes to the charting data or the table information shown. Two versions of this file are logged, implying iterative updates to styling.


`Hero.jsx` (Blog): This component renders the hero section for the blog page.  The update adds search and category filtering functionality, along with styling improvements to blog post display and responsiveness.  There are multiple versions of this file logged, with successive updates modifying the styling and the grid layout for blog post previews (from 1 column to 4).  The most significant change is enhancing the search functionality and refining the blog post display on different screen sizes.

`SocialSummary.jsx`: This component is commented out, indicating it may be under development or temporarily inactive. It appears to be designed to display a summary of social media campaigns, including filtering and pagination.


In summary, the code changes primarily focus on enhancing the user interface and user experience, particularly by improving responsiveness, styling, and adding new features such as search and filtering for blog posts, a more interactive dashboard for campaign insights, and a more visually appealing social landing page.  The frequent updates to `Hero.jsx` (Blog) suggest iterative improvements to the blog's layout and search functionality.  The commented-out `SocialSummary.jsx` hints at future development plans.


## 1:03:00 PM
The log shows updates to frontend and backend components of an application, likely related to image search and order management.

**`ImageSearch.jsx` (Frontend):**  The July 15th, 12:07 PM commit to `ImageSearch.jsx` is a comprehensive update to the image search page.  The code includes features for image upload, database addition, search functionality, pagination, and different view modes (grid/list). Error and success messages are handled with timeouts. The code fetches image data from an API (`import.meta.env.VITE_FAST_API`) and transforms the data before displaying it.  Image upload size and format validation is present.  The code appears to be commented-out, implying it might be a work in progress or undergoing testing.

**`admin.routes.js` (Backend):** The July 15th, 12:08 PM commit shows extensive additions to the backend API routes.  Many routes are added for various admin functionalities, including lead and customer management, order creation, update, and deletion, and integrating with different user roles (Admin, SuperAdmin, Graphics, Cutout, Viewer).  The routes use middleware for authentication (`auth`) and role-based access control (`isAdmin`, `isGraphics`, etc.).  Cloudinary integration (`multer`, `storage`) is evident for file uploads.

**`auth.js` (Backend):** The July 15th, 12:09 PM update introduces authentication and authorization middleware.  It verifies JWT tokens and checks user roles to restrict access to specific routes.  Multiple middleware functions are defined to handle different user roles (`isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isGraphics`, `isCutout`, `isViewer`, `isGraphicsCutout`, `isCutoutAndAdmin`).

**`graphics.controller.js` (Backend):**  This file has three commits between 12:10 PM and 12:19 PM.  The changes primarily focus on the `createOrder` function. Initially, this function had commented-out code and was incomplete. Subsequent commits progressively build the `createOrder` function, adding features for validation of required input fields, handling existing customer IDs, and potentially implementing new customer creation.  The controller also handles order assignment to graphics users, calculates order priority and estimated completion time, and includes notification sending functionality using Socket.IO.  The code extensively uses `mongoose` for database interactions and `Agenda` for scheduling tasks. The later commits demonstrate a focus on robust error handling within transactions.  The use of asynchronous functions and transactions is consistently implemented for database operations.


In summary, the code changes represent a significant development effort across frontend and backend components, primarily focusing on implementing an image search feature (frontend) and a comprehensive order management system with various user roles and robust security (backend). The backend heavily utilizes transactions for database integrity, and the frontend handles user interaction and display of data.  The consistent use of asynchronous functions suggests that performance and responsiveness were key considerations in the development.


## 1:21:58 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to two files within the `Skribe-Backend` project, focusing on the presentation of brand monthly reports.

**`api.ts` (7/15/2025, 12:25:26 PM):** This file, which defines the API service, underwent a single, substantial update.  The primary change involves enhancing the axios interceptor to handle token refresh.  The code now implements a robust mechanism to automatically refresh expired access tokens using a refresh token. Upon failure to refresh, it displays an error message and redirects to the login page. Multiple commented-out base URLs suggest ongoing development or testing across different environments (localhost, beta, and production). The `Alert` component is used for displaying toast messages for network errors and session expiry.

**`Narratives.tsx` (7/15/2025, 12:30:22 PM - 12:54:34 PM):** This file, responsible for the UI of the narratives section of the report,  saw multiple iterative changes between 12:30 PM and 12:54 PM.  The majority of these changes involved adjustments to the layout and styling using Tailwind CSS classes, particularly focusing on the styling of the displayed narratives and chart.  There's a recurring pattern of fine-tuning the chart (`ReactApexChart`)'s `legend` properties (position, size, text truncation),  `grid` styling, and overall component height and max-height for responsiveness. The `baseChartHeight` variable was adjusted several times, finally settling at 320.  There was a significant modification at 12:47 PM and 12:49 PM which resulted in the entire component being commented out, followed by its restoration at 12:51 PM.  This suggests potential debugging or temporary removal of the component. Finally, the `React.FC` type annotation was removed from the `FirstPage` component definition, simplifying the code.  The changes in this file are largely cosmetic and focused on improving the visual presentation of data.  At 1:02 PM, a header section was removed from the `NarrativePage` component, suggesting a change in the desired layout.


The overall pattern shows a phased approach to development: initial implementation of core functionality (API token refresh), followed by iterative refinements of the UI (layout and styling of the narratives report). The comments in `Narratives.tsx`  indicate a potential testing phase or temporary component removal for debugging. The changes across multiple timestamps for `Narratives.tsx` suggest an agile development approach involving continuous improvements and refinements.


## 2:02:58 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `graphics.controller.js` and `Gallery.js`.

**`graphics.controller.js` (7/15/2025, 1:27:11 PM):** This file underwent a significant update involving the `createOrder` function.  The original version was fully commented out and replaced with a new implementation. Key changes include:

*   **Improved Input Validation:** The new `createOrder` function explicitly validates that `requirements`, `dimensions`, and `images` are provided.
*   **Customer Handling:**  Added logic to handle both existing customers (using a provided `customerId`) and new customers. It verifies the existence of existing customers before proceeding.
*   **Changes Tracking:** Introduced a `changes` array (though its purpose isn't fully implemented in the provided snippet).
*   **Error Handling:** The error handling within the transaction management was improved.


**`Gallery.js` (7/15/2025, 1:27:44 PM and 7/15/2025, 1:32:50 PM):**  This file was modified twice within a short period. Both changes are nearly identical, focused on enhancing the `gallerySchema` and the `createGalleryEntries` static method.  The core change in both updates is:

*   **Relaxing Field Requirements:** The `required` fields for `cadFile`, `cadFileName`, and the `order` field within the `gallerySchema` were changed to `false`.  This allows for Gallery entries to be created with missing CAD file information, particularly to accommodate scenarios where only images are uploaded.

*   **Handling Missing CAD Files:** The `createGalleryEntries` method was updated to handle cases where `cadFiles` array is empty. It now gracefully creates gallery entries only with image data when no CAD files are provided.  The second update to this file (1:32:50 PM) appears to be a minor correction or clarification within the handling of the missing `cadFile` case in the `createGalleryEntries` function.  The overall functionality remains the same.

In summary, the changes reflect improvements in error handling, input validation, and flexibility in handling data within both the order creation process and the gallery data model. The changes to `Gallery.js` specifically address the need to accommodate scenarios with only image uploads.


## 2:21:46 PM
The provided code log shows iterative development of a React component (`BrandReport.tsx`) that generates and downloads PDF reports.  The primary focus of the changes is on the `downloadPDFWithLinks` function, which handles PDF generation using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`.

The initial versions (1:34:33 PM and 1:36:07 PM) implemented a method to create a PDF by rendering sections of the page to canvases, converting them to images, and adding them to the PDF document.  This version attempted to preserve links within the PDF using a complex calculation of link positions relative to the rendered image.  However, the image scaling and link positioning was not correctly implemented.


The version at 1:40:15 PM refactored the PDF generation. Instead of trying to maintain aspect ratio and scaling links, the code simplifies to fit the content to the page with the use of `canvas.width * 0.75` and `canvas.height * 0.75` to convert pixels to points. It added explicit scaling calculations to accurately place links on the PDF images. The output PDF filename changed from 'BrandReport_With_Links.pdf' to 'BrandReport_With_Links.pdf'.

The final version at 1:41:31 PM made a minor change, renaming the output PDF file to 'Brand-Report.pdf'.  The core PDF generation logic remains the same as in the previous revision.  Throughout the process, the commented-out `downloadPDF` function suggests an earlier, simpler approach to PDF generation that was replaced.  The `GenerateReport` function remained largely unchanged, consistently fetching data from various API endpoints (`/MonthlyReportDetails`, `/AIBrandReport`, `/BrandMention`) using `userService.get`.  The API calls fetch data based on selected customer, brand, start date, and end date, indicating a dynamic report generation capability. The date range calculation was refined to use UTC to ensure consistent results across time zones.


## 2:51:11 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `Insights.jsx` between 2:07 PM and 2:41 PM on July 15, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout:  managing a dashboard displaying engaged and shortlisted influencers, with features to add/remove rows for deliverables and offline engagements.  The component uses React, along with several icon libraries (`react-icons/fi` and `react-icons/fa`).

The primary changes observed are related to styling and UI improvements.  The early revisions show a progressively refined UI structure, using Tailwind CSS classes for styling.  Between 2:34 PM and 2:41 PM, several modifications focus on removing a "LIVE" status indicator and adding a `font-inter` class to the main div, suggesting a focus on improving the visual presentation and potentially aligning the font with design specifications.  There are also minor changes in commented-out code sections which are unlikely to impact functionality.  The core data structures and logic for handling state (e.g., `deliverableRows`, `engageRows`, `dropdownData`) remain unchanged across all revisions.  The timestamps show a pattern of frequent, relatively small changes, possibly indicating an iterative development process.


## 4:51:21 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `Stats.jsx` and `Insights.jsx`.  The changes span approximately one hour on July 15th, 2025.

**Stats.jsx:**

The primary changes in `Stats.jsx` involve modifications to the pie chart.  Initially, the pie chart displayed "Engaged" and "Not Engaged" data.  Later revisions (around 3:34:57 PM) updated the labels to reflect specific content types ("TikTok Videos," "IG Reels," etc.) and incorporated data percentages into the dataLabels. The colors of pie chart slices were also changed. The component also includes a line chart showing "Effective Followers Growth" and a table displaying various social media metrics ("Likes," "Views," etc.) for different content.  These elements remained relatively consistent across all revisions.  The code was also cleaned up by removing commented-out code in the final revision.  The addition of  ` "use client"`  suggests a change to the React component's rendering method.  The addition of `font-inter` class indicates a change in the font being used.


**Insights.jsx:**

The `Insights.jsx` file underwent extensive revisions between approximately 3:39 PM and 4:33 PM. The core functionality is a dashboard displaying engaged influencers.  Early versions included commented-out code and lacked a fully implemented dropdown menu.  Subsequent changes added a working dropdown with nested categories, allowing users to filter data.  A significant modification was the addition of  `useEffect`  to handle clicks outside the dropdown, closing it. This  `useEffect` hook is added at 3:40:30 PM. The final revisions (after 4:33 PM) commented out the entire component's code, suggesting it might have been temporarily disabled or replaced. The width of dropdown is changed from `min-w-[300px]` to `min-w-[180px]` at 4:32:38PM and  `LIVE` status was added to campaign title at 4:27:44PM.

In summary, the `Stats` component received a visual and data update to the pie chart, while the `Insights` component had a substantial rework of its dropdown functionality, followed by complete commenting-out.  Both files show a consistent use of React state management and lifecycle methods, and consistent use of tailwind CSS classes throughout the revisions. The pattern of commenting out large sections of code in `Insights.jsx` is noteworthy and indicates a potentially unstable or experimental phase of development.


## 9:23:35 PM
The provided code represents two React components: `Narratives` and `BrandSummary`, both part of a brand monthly report dashboard.  Significant changes were made on July 15th, 2025.

**`Narratives.tsx` (3:37:56 PM):** This component displays narratives with timeline charts.  The update focuses on improving the chart's legend and appearance.  Specifically, legend item margins were adjusted for better spacing (`itemMargin: { horizontal: 10, vertical: 5 }`), series names are no longer truncated in the legend, and the chart's overall styling was refined (e.g., grid lines, colors). The component renders a line chart visualizing narrative mentions over time, along with details for the first narrative, including sentiment (displayed with color-coded background), mentions count, authors, outlets, summary, and article links.


**`BrandSummary.tsx` (5:22:46 PM):** This component displays a brand summary with multiple charts and data visualizations.  The update involved restructuring data transformations and calculations. The code now handles data for top publications, journalists, sentiment scores, regional mentions, and brand mentions.  Key changes include:

*   **Data Transformation Functions:** Several functions (`transformPublicationsData`, `transformJournalistsData`, `transformRegionalData`, `transformBrandMentionData`) were implemented to pre-process data for chart rendering, including sorting, slicing, and formatting.
*   **Sentiment Score Calculation:**  The `calculateSentimentScore` function was updated to correctly compute the sentiment score from the new data structure (`Array<{ vchSentiment: string; count: number }>`) .
*   **Chart Rendering:** The component renders several charts using `react-apexcharts`: bar charts for top publications, donut charts for brand mentions (quality) and regional mentions.  The chart options are extensively configured to customize appearance and labels. The use of `useEffect` ensures that charts are updated when data changes.
*   **Data Handling:** The component efficiently handles cases where data might be missing or empty, displaying appropriate messages ("No data available").


Both components use a consistent design style with similar styling elements (e.g., consistent use of colors and fonts) and leverage `react-apexcharts` for data visualization.  The `Narratives` component displays a line chart, while `BrandSummary` employs bar and donut charts.  Both components incorporate images of a logo and handle data dynamically using `useEffect`.
