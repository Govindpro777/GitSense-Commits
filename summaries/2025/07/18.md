# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 1:00:13 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `CreateNewCourse.jsx` and `CourseDashboard.jsx`.  The changes primarily focus on adding course creation functionality to the application.

`CreateNewCourse.jsx` (7/18/2025, 12:23:13 AM and 7/18/2025, 12:59:05 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:59:30 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:59:41 AM): This file contains React code for a form to create new courses.  The initial commit at 12:23:13 AM establishes the basic form structure with input fields for course name, code, category, mode, teachers, description, images, level, type, duration, and specialization. It also includes functionality to add and remove learning objectives and lessons. The subsequent commits at 12:59:05 AM, 12:59:30 AM, and 12:59:41 AM appear to be minor edits or formatting changes without significant functional alterations.  There's no actual course creation logic implemented; the `handleCreateCourse` function only logs the form data.


`CourseDashboard.jsx` (7/18/2025, 12:23:31 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:23:50 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:24:06 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:24:54 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:53:15 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:56:14 AM): This file is a React component for displaying a dashboard of courses. It includes features for searching, filtering courses by status ("All", "public", "draft"), pagination, and deleting courses.  The initial commit at 12:23:31 AM shows a basic course dashboard with search and filter functionality.  The subsequent commits show a series of incremental changes.  The most notable change is the introduction of `CreateNewCoursePopup` at 12:23:50 AM, integrating the course creation functionality from the other file. Further commits at 12:24:06 AM, 12:24:54 AM, 12:53:15 AM and 12:56:14 AM refine the integration of the popup, notably by adding a `handleNewCourseCreated` callback function at 12:56:14 AM to handle the data from the newly created course.  The evolution suggests an iterative development process.  The commented-out sections within `CourseDashboard.jsx` suggest some UI elements might have been experimented with.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes is evident throughout.


## 12:34:13 PM
The `MediaList.jsx` component underwent two updates on July 18, 2025.  The first update at 9:47:51 AM primarily focused on the `downloadExcel` function, which was incomplete in its handling of the downloaded journalist data for Excel export.  The code was missing the creation of the Excel file itself using the `xlsx` library.

The second update at 9:49:27 AM completed the `downloadExcel` function.  This version now correctly processes the journalist data, mapping it to an array of objects suitable for export.  It uses `XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet` and `XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet` to create and populate the Excel workbook. The file is then saved with a name derived from the list name.  Error handling was also improved, with specific warnings for cases such as exceeding download limits and no journalist data being found.  Additionally, the code now includes state and city information in the exported data and displays a more informative warning message when the download limit is exceeded.  The core logic of the component, including data fetching, state management, and UI interactions, remained largely unchanged between the two revisions.


## 12:52:22 PM
The log shows primarily modifications to `CTASection.jsx`, a React component responsible for a call-to-action section on a landing page.  Initial versions (before 11:13 AM) were basic forms lacking server-side interaction.

Between 11:01 AM and 11:03 AM, `CTASection.jsx` was updated to include an import of `userService` and then also `GET_EARLY_ACCESS` from the `constants.js` file, indicating the addition of API interaction for early access.  The `constants.js` file itself was modified during this time, defining various API endpoints, including `GET_EARLY_ACCESS`. This endpoint's path was refined in multiple edits, eventually settling on `${Url_V1}Authenticate/SocialEarlyAccess`.

A significant change occurred at 11:13 AM in `CTASection.jsx`.  The component was refactored to implement OTP (One-Time Password) functionality. The form now handles OTP verification.  Error handling and notification (`useNotification`) were integrated using a `try...catch` block and a switch statement to manage different API response statuses (e.g., "OTP", "Ok", "DomainAlready", "OrganizationAlready", "NotWorkingEmailId").


Between 11:51 AM and 12:24 PM, further refinements to error handling and logging were added to `CTASection.jsx`.  The error messages are improved and more comprehensive logging is introduced. The commented-out code suggests iterative development and experimentation with different approaches. Notably, the status code check is changed from checking for status code 208 as a single conditional to a switch statement.

The `constants.js` file contains many API endpoints related to authentication, user information, and social campaign management. The file remains largely unchanged after its initial modifications, only the path in `GET_EARLY_ACCESS` changed.

Finally, at 12:28 PM and 12:29 PM minor changes were made to `layout.jsx`, shifting the `<ErrorAlerts />` component from outside to inside the `<ErrorContextNotification />` component. This is a small UI adjustment of error-handling elements.

The overall pattern is one of iterative development, with `CTASection.jsx` undergoing substantial changes to incorporate API calls, OTP verification, and improved error handling.  The `constants.js` file provides the API endpoints necessary for the functionality in `CTASection.jsx` and  `CreateCampaign.jsx`. The `CreateCampaign.jsx` component shows a form for creating social media campaigns, uses user information from localStorage, and handles API responses.  The code consistently uses a functional component style with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
