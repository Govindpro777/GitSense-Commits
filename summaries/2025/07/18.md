# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 1:00:13 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `CreateNewCourse.jsx` and `CourseDashboard.jsx`.  The changes primarily focus on adding course creation functionality to the application.

`CreateNewCourse.jsx` (7/18/2025, 12:23:13 AM and 7/18/2025, 12:59:05 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:59:30 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:59:41 AM): This file contains React code for a form to create new courses.  The initial commit at 12:23:13 AM establishes the basic form structure with input fields for course name, code, category, mode, teachers, description, images, level, type, duration, and specialization. It also includes functionality to add and remove learning objectives and lessons. The subsequent commits at 12:59:05 AM, 12:59:30 AM, and 12:59:41 AM appear to be minor edits or formatting changes without significant functional alterations.  There's no actual course creation logic implemented; the `handleCreateCourse` function only logs the form data.


`CourseDashboard.jsx` (7/18/2025, 12:23:31 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:23:50 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:24:06 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:24:54 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:53:15 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:56:14 AM): This file is a React component for displaying a dashboard of courses. It includes features for searching, filtering courses by status ("All", "public", "draft"), pagination, and deleting courses.  The initial commit at 12:23:31 AM shows a basic course dashboard with search and filter functionality.  The subsequent commits show a series of incremental changes.  The most notable change is the introduction of `CreateNewCoursePopup` at 12:23:50 AM, integrating the course creation functionality from the other file. Further commits at 12:24:06 AM, 12:24:54 AM, 12:53:15 AM and 12:56:14 AM refine the integration of the popup, notably by adding a `handleNewCourseCreated` callback function at 12:56:14 AM to handle the data from the newly created course.  The evolution suggests an iterative development process.  The commented-out sections within `CourseDashboard.jsx` suggest some UI elements might have been experimented with.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes is evident throughout.


## 12:34:13 PM
The `MediaList.jsx` component underwent two updates on July 18, 2025.  The first update at 9:47:51 AM primarily focused on the `downloadExcel` function, which was incomplete in its handling of the downloaded journalist data for Excel export.  The code was missing the creation of the Excel file itself using the `xlsx` library.

The second update at 9:49:27 AM completed the `downloadExcel` function.  This version now correctly processes the journalist data, mapping it to an array of objects suitable for export.  It uses `XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet` and `XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet` to create and populate the Excel workbook. The file is then saved with a name derived from the list name.  Error handling was also improved, with specific warnings for cases such as exceeding download limits and no journalist data being found.  Additionally, the code now includes state and city information in the exported data and displays a more informative warning message when the download limit is exceeded.  The core logic of the component, including data fetching, state management, and UI interactions, remained largely unchanged between the two revisions.


## 12:52:22 PM
The log shows primarily modifications to `CTASection.jsx`, a React component responsible for a call-to-action section on a landing page.  Initial versions (before 11:13 AM) were basic forms lacking server-side interaction.

Between 11:01 AM and 11:03 AM, `CTASection.jsx` was updated to include an import of `userService` and then also `GET_EARLY_ACCESS` from the `constants.js` file, indicating the addition of API interaction for early access.  The `constants.js` file itself was modified during this time, defining various API endpoints, including `GET_EARLY_ACCESS`. This endpoint's path was refined in multiple edits, eventually settling on `${Url_V1}Authenticate/SocialEarlyAccess`.

A significant change occurred at 11:13 AM in `CTASection.jsx`.  The component was refactored to implement OTP (One-Time Password) functionality. The form now handles OTP verification.  Error handling and notification (`useNotification`) were integrated using a `try...catch` block and a switch statement to manage different API response statuses (e.g., "OTP", "Ok", "DomainAlready", "OrganizationAlready", "NotWorkingEmailId").


Between 11:51 AM and 12:24 PM, further refinements to error handling and logging were added to `CTASection.jsx`.  The error messages are improved and more comprehensive logging is introduced. The commented-out code suggests iterative development and experimentation with different approaches. Notably, the status code check is changed from checking for status code 208 as a single conditional to a switch statement.

The `constants.js` file contains many API endpoints related to authentication, user information, and social campaign management. The file remains largely unchanged after its initial modifications, only the path in `GET_EARLY_ACCESS` changed.

Finally, at 12:28 PM and 12:29 PM minor changes were made to `layout.jsx`, shifting the `<ErrorAlerts />` component from outside to inside the `<ErrorContextNotification />` component. This is a small UI adjustment of error-handling elements.

The overall pattern is one of iterative development, with `CTASection.jsx` undergoing substantial changes to incorporate API calls, OTP verification, and improved error handling.  The `constants.js` file provides the API endpoints necessary for the functionality in `CTASection.jsx` and  `CreateCampaign.jsx`. The `CreateCampaign.jsx` component shows a form for creating social media campaigns, uses user information from localStorage, and handles API responses.  The code consistently uses a functional component style with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.


## 2:05:38 PM
The log shows two nearly identical commits to `AddTeacher.jsx` within a minute of each other on July 18, 2025.  The file is a React component for adding teachers, handling user input for first name, last name, email, mobile number, password, and branch (if the mode is offline). It uses `react-hook-form` for form validation with Yup schema,  `axios` for API calls to create a teacher, and Lucide-React and react-icons for icons.  The code includes client-side validation, input field styling based on validation status, a password visibility toggle, and a dropdown for selecting a branch.  No functional changes are apparent between the two commits; they appear to be duplicate commits.


## 2:34:26 PM
The `MediaList.jsx` component underwent several revisions on July 18, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes was the implementation and refinement of the `downloadExcel` function.

Initially, the `downloadExcel` function was commented out (1:01:13 PM).  Subsequent updates (starting 1:02:01 PM) progressively uncommented and developed this function.  These updates involved:

* **1:02:01 PM:** The `downloadExcel` function was uncommented. The function was still incomplete, with the core data transformation logic commented out.

* **1:22:04 PM - 1:24:43 PM:** Multiple revisions occurred within a short timeframe, focusing primarily on the data transformation within the `downloadExcel` function.  The key change here was  how outlet names were formatted to include media types ("Outlet Name": outletNamesWithMedia), significantly improving the output data.  Additional "N/A" placeholders were added for missing data fields (Mobile, Phone, Beats, City, State). Error handling was also improved, specifically for API response statuses ("limit exceed") and processing errors.

* **2:12:08 PM:** The final version of `downloadExcel` was completed. The data transformation logic was fully implemented, incorporating media types into outlet names and handling missing data gracefully.  Robust error handling was added to manage various API response scenarios and data processing issues. The function now generates an Excel file named after the list name and includes columns for Name, Outlet Name (with media types), Beats, City, State, Mobile, Phone, Work Email, and Personal Email.

Throughout all revisions, the component's state management and other functionalities (sharing lists, duplicating lists, deleting lists, etc.) remained largely unchanged.  The pattern shows iterative development of the `downloadExcel` function, incrementally adding features and improving error handling.  The frequent commits suggest an agile development approach with rapid iteration and testing.


## 2:52:32 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `CTASection.jsx`, a React component responsible for a form handling early access requests.  The changes primarily focus on improving the user experience and error handling within the component.

Between 1:54 PM and 1:57 PM, several minor updates occurred. The most significant of these was the addition of a `loading` state variable and its corresponding update within the `handleSubmit` function at 1:55:09 PM.  This was further refined at 1:56:05 PM, removing unnecessary console logs and at 1:56:30 PM and 1:56:41 PM  by adding and correcting a `finally` block to ensure the loading state is set to `false` after the API call, regardless of success or failure. At 1:57:08 PM, a loading indicator was implemented in the submit button, enhancing feedback to the user.


A more substantial change occurred at 2:03:30 PM.  Input validation was added to check for missing fields before submitting the form. If any required field is missing, a warning notification is displayed. The `required` attribute was also removed from the input fields.

Finally, between 2:04:24 PM and 2:08:26 PM, no functional changes were made; the only modification is the removal of some console log statements, simplifying the code.


Throughout the log, the component consistently interacts with a `userService` to make API calls using the `GET_EARLY_ACCESS` constant.  The response handling includes different notification types based on the API response status ("OTP", "Ok", "DomainAlready", "OrganizationAlready", "NotWorkingEmailId").  The form collects user data (name, email, organization, mobile, OTP) and updates the UI based on whether the OTP has been sent.


## 3:52:03 PM
The log shows edits to two React components: `CTASection.jsx` and `UseCases.jsx`.

`CTASection.jsx` underwent several revisions between 2:57 PM and 3:04 PM on July 18, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: a form for early access, handling user input, submitting data to a `/GET_EARLY_ACCESS` endpoint via `userService.post`, and displaying notifications based on API responses.  The most significant change during this period was the removal of `console.log` statements from within the `handleSubmit` function's `try` block, simplifying the error handling. The code handles different API response statuses ("OTP", "Ok", "DomainAlready", "OrganizationAlready", "NotWorkingEmailId") and shows appropriate notifications.  Input validation ensures that all required fields are filled and the mobile number format is correct.

`UseCases.jsx` was modified multiple times between 3:30 PM and 3:43 PM on July 18, 2025. These changes focused on styling and layout adjustments within the component, which renders three use cases for Socion.  The core data structure (`cases` array) remained unchanged, showcasing different use cases for brands, agencies, and startups. The styling modifications involved the addition of `items-center` class to the grid to center the content and tweaking the `mx-auto` and `md:mx-0` classes in the inner div to control horizontal alignment across different screen sizes.  Specifically, the bottom margin was adjusted in the `<div className="hidden md:block border-t ...">` section,  and the `mb-1` class was removed from the `<h3>` tag within the mapping function at 3:41 PM.  These changes suggest iterative refinements to the visual presentation of the use cases.


## 4:52:07 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CTASection.jsx` between 4:13 PM and 4:17 PM on July 18, 2025, focusing on input validation for a form.  The `UseCases.jsx` file was modified only once at 4:11 PM on the same day, and it contained a React component displaying use cases for different user groups (Brands, Agencies, Startups).

The `UseCases.jsx` file remained unchanged throughout the log.  It's a relatively static component displaying three use cases with images and descriptions.

The `CTASection.jsx` file underwent several revisions, all centered around improving the handling of the "mobile" input field within a form.  The initial versions had less robust validation.  Subsequent revisions introduced progressively more sophisticated validation:

* **4:13 PM and 4:13:36 PM:**  Initial versions of the form lacked specific input validation for the mobile number field beyond a basic length check.

* **4:14:30 PM:**  A significant change was made.  The `handleChange` function was updated to remove non-digit characters and limit the mobile number input to a maximum of 10 digits.

* **4:14:52 PM and 4:14:58 PM:** These revisions are practically identical and refine the mobile number validation by using `value.replace(/\D/g, "").slice(0, 10)` to ensure only digits are allowed and the length does not exceed 10.  These changes are functionally the same.

* **4:16:32 PM and 4:17:44 PM:** These final revisions further enhance the validation.  Now, a notification is displayed if non-numeric characters are entered into the mobile number field.  The code then proceeds to clean and limit the input.  The functional changes are minor.  The primary difference is using a regular expression `^[0-9]*$` to check if input is numeric before cleaning and limiting.

In summary, the major development activity involved refining the user experience and data integrity of a form by progressively enhancing mobile number input validation within the `CTASection.jsx` component.
