# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 1:00:13 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `CreateNewCourse.jsx` and `CourseDashboard.jsx`.  The changes primarily focus on adding course creation functionality to the application.

`CreateNewCourse.jsx` (7/18/2025, 12:23:13 AM and 7/18/2025, 12:59:05 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:59:30 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:59:41 AM): This file contains React code for a form to create new courses.  The initial commit at 12:23:13 AM establishes the basic form structure with input fields for course name, code, category, mode, teachers, description, images, level, type, duration, and specialization. It also includes functionality to add and remove learning objectives and lessons. The subsequent commits at 12:59:05 AM, 12:59:30 AM, and 12:59:41 AM appear to be minor edits or formatting changes without significant functional alterations.  There's no actual course creation logic implemented; the `handleCreateCourse` function only logs the form data.


`CourseDashboard.jsx` (7/18/2025, 12:23:31 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:23:50 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:24:06 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:24:54 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:53:15 AM, 7/18/2025, 12:56:14 AM): This file is a React component for displaying a dashboard of courses. It includes features for searching, filtering courses by status ("All", "public", "draft"), pagination, and deleting courses.  The initial commit at 12:23:31 AM shows a basic course dashboard with search and filter functionality.  The subsequent commits show a series of incremental changes.  The most notable change is the introduction of `CreateNewCoursePopup` at 12:23:50 AM, integrating the course creation functionality from the other file. Further commits at 12:24:06 AM, 12:24:54 AM, 12:53:15 AM and 12:56:14 AM refine the integration of the popup, notably by adding a `handleNewCourseCreated` callback function at 12:56:14 AM to handle the data from the newly created course.  The evolution suggests an iterative development process.  The commented-out sections within `CourseDashboard.jsx` suggest some UI elements might have been experimented with.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes is evident throughout.
