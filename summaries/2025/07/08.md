# Activity Summary for 7/8/2025

## 10:09:18 AM
The initial version of `SocialLandingPage.jsx` (7/8/2025, 9:12:54 AM) is a simple React component that renders a `Header` and a `Hero` component within a div.  The component uses the `font-inter` class and sets the minimum height to the screen.  No significant patterns or recurring elements are present in this initial commit.


## 10:43:19 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `CourseForm.jsx`, a React component for managing course forms.  The evolution reveals a focus on improving error handling, input management, and access control.

The earliest version (9:48:16 AM) establishes the component's structure, including input fields for course details (name, description, etc.),  a mode toggle (online/offline), branch selection (for offline courses), and teacher assignment.  It utilizes custom React components (`TeacherSearchDropdown`, `SelectOption`, `Button`, `Input`, `OnlineOfflineToggle`) and external libraries (`react-icons`, `react-toastify`).  Robust error handling is already present, using the `errors` state to display validation messages.  The code efficiently handles nested object updates within the `data` state.

A significant change occurs at 10:03:01 AM, where the entire component is commented out. This suggests a temporary removal or complete overhaul.

The next version (10:04:38 AM) reintroduces the component but adds logic to disable online course creation based on user roles and session storage data ("userData").  The `isOnlineDisabled` state controls this restriction. The error handling remains, and nested object updates are handled.


The version at 10:05:01 AM is almost identical to the previous one; the minor differences appear to be formatting changes.

The revision at 10:08:24 AM refactors the session storage access. Instead of using `userData`, it now reads  "user" from sessionStorage and separately extracts the `role` and `mode` which is then used to determine `isOnlineDisabled`.  The error message is refined to "Online courses are disabled for this user."

Finally, a version at 10:09:12 AM is nearly identical to the initial version (9:48:16 AM). The only difference appears to be a comment about passing the selected branch ID to `TeacherSearchDropdown` and some code comments being added to `handleBranchChange`. This suggests the version from 10:03:01 AM to 10:08:24 AM may have been an experimental branch or a temporary state before reverting back to a modification of the initial version, with session storage being addressed in the intermediate commits.  The final version likely incorporates the refined error messages and session storage handling from the intermediate edits, but lacks the online course restriction.

Throughout the changes, consistent use of functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef), and a clear separation of concerns are observed. The overall pattern is one of iterative development, with emphasis on improving user experience and access control.
