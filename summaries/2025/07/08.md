# Activity Summary for 7/8/2025

## 10:09:18 AM
The initial version of `SocialLandingPage.jsx` (7/8/2025, 9:12:54 AM) is a simple React component that renders a `Header` and a `Hero` component within a div.  The component uses the `font-inter` class and sets the minimum height to the screen.  No significant patterns or recurring elements are present in this initial commit.


## 10:43:19 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `CourseForm.jsx`, a React component for managing course forms.  The evolution reveals a focus on improving error handling, input management, and access control.

The earliest version (9:48:16 AM) establishes the component's structure, including input fields for course details (name, description, etc.),  a mode toggle (online/offline), branch selection (for offline courses), and teacher assignment.  It utilizes custom React components (`TeacherSearchDropdown`, `SelectOption`, `Button`, `Input`, `OnlineOfflineToggle`) and external libraries (`react-icons`, `react-toastify`).  Robust error handling is already present, using the `errors` state to display validation messages.  The code efficiently handles nested object updates within the `data` state.

A significant change occurs at 10:03:01 AM, where the entire component is commented out. This suggests a temporary removal or complete overhaul.

The next version (10:04:38 AM) reintroduces the component but adds logic to disable online course creation based on user roles and session storage data ("userData").  The `isOnlineDisabled` state controls this restriction. The error handling remains, and nested object updates are handled.


The version at 10:05:01 AM is almost identical to the previous one; the minor differences appear to be formatting changes.

The revision at 10:08:24 AM refactors the session storage access. Instead of using `userData`, it now reads  "user" from sessionStorage and separately extracts the `role` and `mode` which is then used to determine `isOnlineDisabled`.  The error message is refined to "Online courses are disabled for this user."

Finally, a version at 10:09:12 AM is nearly identical to the initial version (9:48:16 AM). The only difference appears to be a comment about passing the selected branch ID to `TeacherSearchDropdown` and some code comments being added to `handleBranchChange`. This suggests the version from 10:03:01 AM to 10:08:24 AM may have been an experimental branch or a temporary state before reverting back to a modification of the initial version, with session storage being addressed in the intermediate commits.  The final version likely incorporates the refined error messages and session storage handling from the intermediate edits, but lacks the online course restriction.

Throughout the changes, consistent use of functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef), and a clear separation of concerns are observed. The overall pattern is one of iterative development, with emphasis on improving user experience and access control.


## 11:09:29 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `Hero.jsx` component within a Next.js application (`Skribe-Frontend`).  Initially, the `Hero.jsx` component was relatively simple, importing necessary modules and rendering a `Header` and a `Hero` section (with a missing import of `WhyThisProduct` in the first entry, quickly corrected).

Significant changes occurred between **10:17:56 AM** and **10:59:25 AM**.  During this period, the `Hero` component underwent a complete overhaul.  The original design, featuring a background image and a two-column layout, was replaced by a design incorporating a header, a more prominent heading and paragraph, a list of features, and a flexible grid layout for showcasing multiple images.  The image assets also changed from `/assets/banner.png` to a series of SVGs with names like `/assets/social-1.svg`, `/assets/social-2.svg`, and so on.

Between **10:24:11 AM** and **10:29:54 AM**, there was experimentation with different layout structures for the image grid.  Initially a `grid grid-cols-2` layout was used, which then evolved into a  `grid grid-cols-3` layout to accommodate more images.

Between **10:28:09 AM** and **10:59:25 AM** the `Hero` component was completely replaced with `InfluencerDiscoveryPage`.  The `Hero` component was commented out, indicating a decision to move the component's content into a new component. The `InfluencerDiscoveryPage` component displays a background image, a header with a "Get Early Access" button, and a hero section with a prominent title, description, and a flexbox layout for images.  The styling also changed, with shifts in colors, font sizes, and rounded corners.   There were further adjustments to image sizing and positioning throughout this period and more images were added.  The final layout uses `flex flex-row` and `flex flex-col` to arrange the images within the hero section. The `SocialLandingPage.jsx` component demonstrates the integration of these changes. The `Header` component was eventually removed from `SocialLandingPage.jsx`, suggesting its functionality was incorporated directly into `InfluencerDiscoveryPage.jsx`.  Finally, between 11:00:15 AM and 11:03:09 AM, the imagesâ€™ rounded corners were adjusted.


## 1:09:26 PM
The log shows several modifications to React components within a Next.js application.  The most significant changes occurred between 11:33 AM and 11:38 AM, focusing on `EmailPreview.jsx`. These updates involved refining the UI, adding functionality for handling attachments (adding, removing, and displaying PDF previews), and implementing backend communication (`userService.put`) to update campaign briefs.  The changes to `EmailPreview.jsx`  also included adding loading and error states and improving the UI responsiveness.

Between 12:04 PM and 12:46 PM, multiple edits were made to `WhyThisProduct.jsx`.  These revisions centered on the component's visual presentation. Initially, the component utilized Font Awesome icons, but these were later replaced with images (`/assets/social-icon*.svg`).  Subsequent changes adjusted styling, including font sizes, colors, spacing, grid layouts, and component dimensions for improved responsiveness and visual appeal. The changes also involved replacing the text "target profile" with "buyer profile" in one of the feature descriptions.

From 12:20 PM to 12:46 PM, `UseCases.jsx` underwent extensive revisions. The primary focus was on updating the styling and layout of the component. This included modifications to the overall structure, image sizes, font styles, color schemes, and various class names to optimize the visual presentation and responsiveness.  The component's functionality remained largely consistent, though icons were removed, simplifying its structure.  The image paths within `UseCases.jsx` were updated to use specifically named SVGs for each use case, replacing a repeated image path.

Finally, at 12:57 PM, `Testimonials.jsx` was updated to change image paths to use SVGs and a section of the code was commented out.  This likely represents a temporary removal or disabling of a section of the component for testing or other development purposes. The overall structure and layout remained largely unchanged.  The `SocialLandingPage.jsx` component was also updated to include `UseCases` and `Testimonials` components.


## 2:09:22 PM
The log shows a series of rapid code modifications to the `Testimonials.jsx` component within a Next.js Scribes application.  Initially, the component displayed testimonials using a hardcoded array and `react-icons/fi` for star ratings.

Between 1:50 PM and 1:59 PM, the component was completely rewritten, replacing `react-icons/fi` with `lucide-react` for the star icons, updating testimonial content and speaker roles, and refining the styling (changing background color, image size, and text styles).

Subsequent changes (2:00 PM onwards) involved removing and re-adding sections of code, suggesting experimentation and iterative refinement.  These changes did not significantly alter the core functionality but involved small adjustments to styling and content.  Specifically, the star rating display was commented out and finally removed completely in these iterations.

Finally,  a `UseCases` component was introduced, replacing the `Testimonials` component, while still retaining much of the similar styling and structure using map functions and images.  This component displays three use cases ("For Brands," "For Agencies," "For Startups") with corresponding descriptions and images.  The `UseCases` component also undergoes several iterative changes, mostly concerning stylistic elements like spacing, font sizes, colors, and the way text is displayed in the component.  Importantly, the `rating` property is added to the `cases` array but remains unused until the very last revision at 2:08 PM, where it is used to display star ratings.  The final code displays the star ratings based on the `rating` property. The image assets seem to be reused across both components, suggesting potential for optimization.
