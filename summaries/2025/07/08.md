# Activity Summary for 7/8/2025

## 10:09:18 AM
The initial version of `SocialLandingPage.jsx` (7/8/2025, 9:12:54 AM) is a simple React component that renders a `Header` and a `Hero` component within a div.  The component uses the `font-inter` class and sets the minimum height to the screen.  No significant patterns or recurring elements are present in this initial commit.


## 10:43:19 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `CourseForm.jsx`, a React component for managing course forms.  The evolution reveals a focus on improving error handling, input management, and access control.

The earliest version (9:48:16 AM) establishes the component's structure, including input fields for course details (name, description, etc.),  a mode toggle (online/offline), branch selection (for offline courses), and teacher assignment.  It utilizes custom React components (`TeacherSearchDropdown`, `SelectOption`, `Button`, `Input`, `OnlineOfflineToggle`) and external libraries (`react-icons`, `react-toastify`).  Robust error handling is already present, using the `errors` state to display validation messages.  The code efficiently handles nested object updates within the `data` state.

A significant change occurs at 10:03:01 AM, where the entire component is commented out. This suggests a temporary removal or complete overhaul.

The next version (10:04:38 AM) reintroduces the component but adds logic to disable online course creation based on user roles and session storage data ("userData").  The `isOnlineDisabled` state controls this restriction. The error handling remains, and nested object updates are handled.


The version at 10:05:01 AM is almost identical to the previous one; the minor differences appear to be formatting changes.

The revision at 10:08:24 AM refactors the session storage access. Instead of using `userData`, it now reads  "user" from sessionStorage and separately extracts the `role` and `mode` which is then used to determine `isOnlineDisabled`.  The error message is refined to "Online courses are disabled for this user."

Finally, a version at 10:09:12 AM is nearly identical to the initial version (9:48:16 AM). The only difference appears to be a comment about passing the selected branch ID to `TeacherSearchDropdown` and some code comments being added to `handleBranchChange`. This suggests the version from 10:03:01 AM to 10:08:24 AM may have been an experimental branch or a temporary state before reverting back to a modification of the initial version, with session storage being addressed in the intermediate commits.  The final version likely incorporates the refined error messages and session storage handling from the intermediate edits, but lacks the online course restriction.

Throughout the changes, consistent use of functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef), and a clear separation of concerns are observed. The overall pattern is one of iterative development, with emphasis on improving user experience and access control.


## 11:09:29 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `Hero.jsx` component within a Next.js application (`Skribe-Frontend`).  Initially, the `Hero.jsx` component was relatively simple, importing necessary modules and rendering a `Header` and a `Hero` section (with a missing import of `WhyThisProduct` in the first entry, quickly corrected).

Significant changes occurred between **10:17:56 AM** and **10:59:25 AM**.  During this period, the `Hero` component underwent a complete overhaul.  The original design, featuring a background image and a two-column layout, was replaced by a design incorporating a header, a more prominent heading and paragraph, a list of features, and a flexible grid layout for showcasing multiple images.  The image assets also changed from `/assets/banner.png` to a series of SVGs with names like `/assets/social-1.svg`, `/assets/social-2.svg`, and so on.

Between **10:24:11 AM** and **10:29:54 AM**, there was experimentation with different layout structures for the image grid.  Initially a `grid grid-cols-2` layout was used, which then evolved into a  `grid grid-cols-3` layout to accommodate more images.

Between **10:28:09 AM** and **10:59:25 AM** the `Hero` component was completely replaced with `InfluencerDiscoveryPage`.  The `Hero` component was commented out, indicating a decision to move the component's content into a new component. The `InfluencerDiscoveryPage` component displays a background image, a header with a "Get Early Access" button, and a hero section with a prominent title, description, and a flexbox layout for images.  The styling also changed, with shifts in colors, font sizes, and rounded corners.   There were further adjustments to image sizing and positioning throughout this period and more images were added.  The final layout uses `flex flex-row` and `flex flex-col` to arrange the images within the hero section. The `SocialLandingPage.jsx` component demonstrates the integration of these changes. The `Header` component was eventually removed from `SocialLandingPage.jsx`, suggesting its functionality was incorporated directly into `InfluencerDiscoveryPage.jsx`.  Finally, between 11:00:15 AM and 11:03:09 AM, the imagesâ€™ rounded corners were adjusted.


## 1:09:26 PM
The log shows several modifications to React components within a Next.js application.  The most significant changes occurred between 11:33 AM and 11:38 AM, focusing on `EmailPreview.jsx`. These updates involved refining the UI, adding functionality for handling attachments (adding, removing, and displaying PDF previews), and implementing backend communication (`userService.put`) to update campaign briefs.  The changes to `EmailPreview.jsx`  also included adding loading and error states and improving the UI responsiveness.

Between 12:04 PM and 12:46 PM, multiple edits were made to `WhyThisProduct.jsx`.  These revisions centered on the component's visual presentation. Initially, the component utilized Font Awesome icons, but these were later replaced with images (`/assets/social-icon*.svg`).  Subsequent changes adjusted styling, including font sizes, colors, spacing, grid layouts, and component dimensions for improved responsiveness and visual appeal. The changes also involved replacing the text "target profile" with "buyer profile" in one of the feature descriptions.

From 12:20 PM to 12:46 PM, `UseCases.jsx` underwent extensive revisions. The primary focus was on updating the styling and layout of the component. This included modifications to the overall structure, image sizes, font styles, color schemes, and various class names to optimize the visual presentation and responsiveness.  The component's functionality remained largely consistent, though icons were removed, simplifying its structure.  The image paths within `UseCases.jsx` were updated to use specifically named SVGs for each use case, replacing a repeated image path.

Finally, at 12:57 PM, `Testimonials.jsx` was updated to change image paths to use SVGs and a section of the code was commented out.  This likely represents a temporary removal or disabling of a section of the component for testing or other development purposes. The overall structure and layout remained largely unchanged.  The `SocialLandingPage.jsx` component was also updated to include `UseCases` and `Testimonials` components.


## 2:09:22 PM
The log shows a series of rapid code modifications to the `Testimonials.jsx` component within a Next.js Scribes application.  Initially, the component displayed testimonials using a hardcoded array and `react-icons/fi` for star ratings.

Between 1:50 PM and 1:59 PM, the component was completely rewritten, replacing `react-icons/fi` with `lucide-react` for the star icons, updating testimonial content and speaker roles, and refining the styling (changing background color, image size, and text styles).

Subsequent changes (2:00 PM onwards) involved removing and re-adding sections of code, suggesting experimentation and iterative refinement.  These changes did not significantly alter the core functionality but involved small adjustments to styling and content.  Specifically, the star rating display was commented out and finally removed completely in these iterations.

Finally,  a `UseCases` component was introduced, replacing the `Testimonials` component, while still retaining much of the similar styling and structure using map functions and images.  This component displays three use cases ("For Brands," "For Agencies," "For Startups") with corresponding descriptions and images.  The `UseCases` component also undergoes several iterative changes, mostly concerning stylistic elements like spacing, font sizes, colors, and the way text is displayed in the component.  Importantly, the `rating` property is added to the `cases` array but remains unused until the very last revision at 2:08 PM, where it is used to display star ratings.  The final code displays the star ratings based on the `rating` property. The image assets seem to be reused across both components, suggesting potential for optimization.


## 2:24:09 PM
The primary change on July 8th, 2025, at 1:32:44 PM,  involved updating `api.ts` within the Skribe-Backend service. This file handles API calls, using axios.  The key update is a robust implementation of access token refresh logic.  The code now includes interceptors to handle both request and response errors.  On 401 errors (unauthorized), it attempts to refresh the access token using a refresh token.  If the refresh fails, the user is redirected to the login page.  Error handling includes a check for network errors, displaying a toast message, and managing concurrent refresh attempts to prevent race conditions.  The base URL for API calls is configurable and currently set to `https://beta.goskribe.com/API/v1`.  The code also uses a custom `Alert` component for displaying messages.  The `TokenService` is used to manage local access and refresh tokens.


## 3:09:23 PM
The log shows a series of code changes made between 2:35 PM and 3:08 PM on July 8, 2025, primarily focusing on the `src\components\BeforeLoginPages\SocialLanding` directory within a Next.js Scribes frontend application.


The `Testimonials.jsx` component underwent a major revision.  Initially, it was a commented-out component displaying testimonials using a hardcoded array and `react-icons/fi`. Later, it was replaced entirely with a `UseCases` component which displays similar information (testimonials), but with a different visual presentation and structure.  The UseCases component displays testimonials with images, titles, descriptions, and star ratings, making better use of styling, and uses a cleaner data structure.

The `SocialLandingPage.jsx` component saw several minor updates.  Initially, it only rendered `Hero`, `WhyThisProduct`, `UseCases`, and `Testimonials` components. It was subsequently modified to also include `CTASection` and `Footer` components, indicating the addition of a call to action and footer sections to the landing page. These modifications happened in quick succession (within a few minutes).


The `CTASection.jsx` component underwent extensive styling changes and refinements throughout the log. The initial version was a simple form with a gradient background.  Subsequent changes involved:

* Adding a background image (`/assets/social-formbg.png`).
* Modifying the background color from a gradient to `#FDF1D9`.
* Iterative adjustments to styling properties (font sizes, colors, rounded corners), using inline styles extensively.
* Changes to the `max-w` property of the form.
* Moving the submit button to be right-aligned within its container.
* Removing the `w-full` class from the submit button.


The changes to `CTASection.jsx` suggest a focus on visual improvements and responsiveness, with multiple small adjustments to fine-tune the form's appearance and layout.  The styling heavily utilizes Tailwind CSS.  The form itself remains functionally consistent, always collecting name, email, and organization data.  No backend integration for form submission is apparent in the log (it only logs to the console).


## 11:58:14 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React components within a Next.js application, specifically focusing on the styling and layout of a social landing page.  The changes span several hours on July 8th, 2025.

`CTASection.jsx`: This component, a call-to-action section, underwent several minor revisions between 3:14 PM and 11:43 PM.  The primary changes involved adjustments to button padding (`px-3` to `px-4`), text size (`text-md` addition), and minor styling tweaks.  No functional changes to the form submission logic were made.  A final revision at 11:43 PM significantly refactored the component to use Tailwind CSS responsive design classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`), resulting in a more responsive layout.

`Footer.jsx`:  This component was extensively reworked between 3:15 PM and 11:29 PM. Initially, it featured a grid-based layout for navigation links.  Between 3:15 PM and 3:29 PM, the entire Footer component was replaced with a simpler design.  Subsequent edits from 5:19 PM to 11:29 PM adjusted spacing (`space-x-8`, `space-x-10`, `space-x-12`, `space-x-18`, `space-x-24`) between navigation links and social media icons. Finally, the social media icons were replaced with images, and the layout was further refined using Tailwind CSS responsive design.  The final version uses images for social media instead of React icons.

`Testimonials.jsx`: This component displays testimonials.  Modifications between 3:38 PM and 11:48 PM mostly concentrated on refining the layout using Tailwind CSS's responsive design capabilities.  The most significant change involved switching from a three-column grid to a responsive grid that adjusts based on screen size, along with changes in text sizes and spacing.  The image for the star rating was also updated.

`Hero.jsx`: This component, the hero section of the landing page, saw numerous edits from 3:41 PM to 4:45 PM. These focused mainly on adjusting padding, text sizes, and the `grid` layout parameters for responsiveness across different screen sizes. The component name was also changed from `InfluencerDiscoveryPage` to `HeroPage` in the final commit at 4:45 PM.  There was also a large refactoring at 4:13 PM introducing responsive design using Tailwind classes and adjusting the size of the images.

`Navbar.jsx`: This component was updated only once, at 5:06 PM. This update involved implementing a dropdown menu for "Products" and "Resources" sections, creating a responsive navigation bar, and adding smooth scrolling behavior on link clicks.  The code also utilizes lazy loading for React icons.


`WhyThisProduct.jsx`: This component, showing product features, was updated multiple times between 5:08 PM and 5:13 PM.  The changes mostly involved adjusting the spacing (`gap-6`, `gap-2`, `gap-3`, `gap-4`) between the featured items on different screen sizes and minor adjustments to the padding and text size, all leveraging Tailwind CSS responsiveness.


A common pattern is the extensive use of Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.  Most changes involved iterative refinements to spacing, padding, and font sizes to optimize the visual presentation of the components, particularly for different screen sizes.  Many changes included commented-out code, suggesting a process of trial and error in achieving the desired design.
