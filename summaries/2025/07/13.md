# Activity Summary for 7/13/2025

## 12:42:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a React component (`Settings.jsx`) for changing passwords and a commented-out login controller (`loginController.js`).

`Settings.jsx` underwent several stylistic and functional updates between 5:24 PM and 5:27 PM on July 12, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on improving the UI/UX:

* **Icon Change:** The icon changed from `Key` to `KeyRound` from lucide-react library.
* **Styling Updates:**  Numerous CSS class updates were made, refining the component's visual appearance.  The changes involved adjustments to colors (`text-[#5A6ACF]`, `bg-[#5A6ACF]`, `bg-[#4A5AC0]`), padding, margins, font styles, and border styles. The `max-width` of the container was also adjusted to improve responsiveness.
* **Margin and Padding Adjustments:** Multiple `mt-*` and `p-*` class updates indicate refinements to the component's spacing.  The `mt-14` and later `mt-16` adjustments suggest fine-tuning vertical spacing around the main component.  Also, `max-w-[600px]` was added in the last revision to control the maximum width of the component.
* **Loading indicator:** A loading indicator was added to show that password change is in progress.  
* **Email Handling:** A significant functional change was the introduction of logic to retrieve the user's email from `sessionStorage`.  This email is then used in the password change request, improving security by eliminating the need to explicitly pass the email in the component props. Error handling was also improved for cases where user data is not found in `sessionStorage`.

The `loginController.js` file contains commented-out code for handling user logins using email, mobile number, and password. This suggests that there may have been alternative login methods being considered or updated at some point. The file primarily features a `shortcutWalalogin` function with no `role` parameter specified. There are commented-out functions (`login` and `verifyOtp`), likely representing older or alternative versions of login functionality, including OTP-based verification.  The commented-out code is extensive and suggests a significant refactoring or change in authentication strategy.
