# Activity Summary for 7/13/2025

## 12:42:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a React component (`Settings.jsx`) for changing passwords and a commented-out login controller (`loginController.js`).

`Settings.jsx` underwent several stylistic and functional updates between 5:24 PM and 5:27 PM on July 12, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on improving the UI/UX:

* **Icon Change:** The icon changed from `Key` to `KeyRound` from lucide-react library.
* **Styling Updates:**  Numerous CSS class updates were made, refining the component's visual appearance.  The changes involved adjustments to colors (`text-[#5A6ACF]`, `bg-[#5A6ACF]`, `bg-[#4A5AC0]`), padding, margins, font styles, and border styles. The `max-width` of the container was also adjusted to improve responsiveness.
* **Margin and Padding Adjustments:** Multiple `mt-*` and `p-*` class updates indicate refinements to the component's spacing.  The `mt-14` and later `mt-16` adjustments suggest fine-tuning vertical spacing around the main component.  Also, `max-w-[600px]` was added in the last revision to control the maximum width of the component.
* **Loading indicator:** A loading indicator was added to show that password change is in progress.  
* **Email Handling:** A significant functional change was the introduction of logic to retrieve the user's email from `sessionStorage`.  This email is then used in the password change request, improving security by eliminating the need to explicitly pass the email in the component props. Error handling was also improved for cases where user data is not found in `sessionStorage`.

The `loginController.js` file contains commented-out code for handling user logins using email, mobile number, and password. This suggests that there may have been alternative login methods being considered or updated at some point. The file primarily features a `shortcutWalalogin` function with no `role` parameter specified. There are commented-out functions (`login` and `verifyOtp`), likely representing older or alternative versions of login functionality, including OTP-based verification.  The commented-out code is extensive and suggests a significant refactoring or change in authentication strategy.


## 12:33:04 PM
The log shows code changes across several files in a Learning Management System (LMS) project, primarily between July 13th, 2025, 12:12 PM and 12:21 PM.

**`demoCoursesController.js`**: This file underwent updates to the `createDemoCourse` function, adding an `installmentPayment` field to handle installment payment options.  Input validation was enhanced to ensure that `installmentPayment` is a non-negative number, with an optional maximum installment limit of 12.  A new `bookCourseController` function was added to manage course bookings, including validation for course existence, seat availability, and duplicate booking prevention. The `getAllStudentInCourse` function was added to retrieve all students enrolled in a particular course.  The changes primarily improve functionality and input validation.  The most significant change occurred at 12:12:04 PM.

**`CourseForm.jsx`**:  This React component, a form for creating or editing courses, received significant modifications. The most substantial changes happened at 12:15:08 PM.  These changes involved integrating user role-based restrictions, specifically disabling branch selection for admin users.  Admin users will have their branch and mode automatically set based on their session data.  The changes enhance security and improve the user experience for different roles.

**`AllAdmins.jsx`**: This React component, displaying a list of admins, was updated at 12:15:20 PM and again at 12:15:40 PM, but the changes between the two commits appear minimal and only reflects comment updates. The component allows searching, filtering by mode, pagination, and exporting to Excel.  The major changes focus on improving the UI.


**`AllSales.jsx`**: This component, for managing sales persons, was updated at 12:16:01 PM, introducing functionality to change the status of sales persons (active/inactive) and handle loading states appropriately.  It utilizes the `axios` library for API calls.  The changes were focused on improving the UI and backend integration.

**`Profile.jsx`**: This component was updated multiple times (12:17:00 PM, 12:17:23 PM, 12:21:35 PM), adding a password change functionality.  The earlier revisions focused on displaying profile information based on user roles.  The final revision introduced a password change section and relevant handlers to update passwords securely.  This involved adding input fields for current, new, and confirm passwords, along with validation and loading states.


Throughout the changes, there's a consistent pattern of improving input validation, adding features based on user roles (admin, teacher, student), and enhancing UI elements for better user experience.  The use of React, Mongoose, and other libraries are prevalent across the code.  There is also evidence of using environment variables (e.g., `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL`), although the actual content isn't shown.
