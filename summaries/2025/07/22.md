# Activity Summary for 7/22/2025

## 12:35:32 AM
The log shows a React component (`EmailPreview.jsx`) undergoing significant revisions between 7/21/2025, 5:45 PM and 11:19 PM.  The core functionality remains consistent:  displaying a preview of an email related to an Instagram campaign, allowing editing of the campaign brief, and managing attached files.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Socion\social\src\components\Social\EmailPreview.jsx`**

* **Initial Changes (5:45 PM - 5:48 PM):**  Early commits focus on improving the email preview by removing an unused `extractCampaignBrief` function. There were also minor changes to how the attachment deletion updates the `draftData` state.

* **Significant Refactoring (5:48 PM - 5:55 PM):** A substantial change involved refactoring the `updateDraftData` function. Initially, it updated the campaign brief and then updated local state.  This was changed to first update the campaign brief on the backend using `userService.put`, then refetch the updated data using `userService.get` to ensure data consistency.  This three-step process (update, fetch, update local state) improves reliability.


* **HTML to Plain Text Conversion (5:55 PM - 6:02 PM):**  A new utility function, `htmlToPlainText`, was introduced and integrated into `EmailPreview.jsx`. This function converts HTML content to plain text, improving the handling of rich text in the campaign brief (`draftData?.draftData?.campBrief`). This addressed a potential issue with HTML tags in the brief causing problems.


* **Removal of commented out code (6:12 PM & 6:16 PM):**  Two commits completely commented out the entire `EmailPreview` component.


* **UI Enhancements and Email Signature (11:19 PM):** The final revision significantly altered the UI, separating the campaign brief and email signature into distinct textareas. It also added labels for clarity and improved the input placeholder text. The `generateEmailTemplate` function was modified to accept and include the email signature.  The length limit for the campaign brief was changed from 2000 characters to 3000.


**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Socion\social\src\components\Social\htmlToPlainText.jsx`**

* **Creation (5:56 PM):** A new file (`htmlToPlainText.jsx`) was added, containing a utility function for converting HTML to plain text.  This function handles various HTML elements like paragraphs, lists, and line breaks (`<br>`), creating well-formatted plain text output.

The overall pattern in the `EmailPreview.jsx` changes is a move towards robustness, improved data handling, and a more user-friendly interface. The addition of the `htmlToPlainText` utility shows a focus on solving potential data inconsistencies and ensuring that the application handles rich text data in campaign brief more reliably. The final commented-out state indicates a potential rollback or temporary removal of the component from the project, though the last commit shows an updated version.


## 12:50:37 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `AddTeacher.jsx`, a React component for adding teacher records.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions:  a form to collect teacher details (first name, last name, email, mobile number, password, branch, and mode), validation using Yup and React Hook Form, and submission via an API call to  `teacher/createTeacher`.

Early revisions (12:03 AM) show the component's initial structure, with commented-out code suggesting an earlier, perhaps incomplete, version.  The commented code includes imports and state variables, indicating a gradual build-up of the component's features.

A significant change occurred around 12:12 AM, where the commented-out code was replaced with complete, functional code.  This commit introduced a fully functional form with input fields, validation, a branch dropdown with pagination and a conditional rendering based on the selected 'mode', and input controls for password visibility.  The dropdown's functionality includes handling clicks outside the dropdown area and scrolling for pagination.

Subsequent modifications (12:14 AM - 12:34 AM) appear to be minor formatting adjustments and the addition of a loading indicator during submission.


The final significant update (12:44 AM - 12:47 AM) involves the addition of user role-based access control.  The component now fetches user role and branch information from session storage (`sessionStorage.getItem('roleBaseData')`). Based on whether the user is an "admin", "superadmin" or a regular user, the branch selection is handled differently.  Admins are pre-selected with their own branch, superadmins can choose any branch, and regular users can select a branch as before.  The branch dropdown is also disabled for admin and superadmin users and the conditional rendering for Branch selection in UI is also modified accordingly.  Error handling is improved.

Throughout the entire log, the file path remains the same, indicating that all changes were made within the same component.  The pattern of incremental development with small changes in between is apparent.
