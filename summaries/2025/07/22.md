# Activity Summary for 7/22/2025

## 12:35:32 AM
The log shows a React component (`EmailPreview.jsx`) undergoing significant revisions between 7/21/2025, 5:45 PM and 11:19 PM.  The core functionality remains consistent:  displaying a preview of an email related to an Instagram campaign, allowing editing of the campaign brief, and managing attached files.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Socion\social\src\components\Social\EmailPreview.jsx`**

* **Initial Changes (5:45 PM - 5:48 PM):**  Early commits focus on improving the email preview by removing an unused `extractCampaignBrief` function. There were also minor changes to how the attachment deletion updates the `draftData` state.

* **Significant Refactoring (5:48 PM - 5:55 PM):** A substantial change involved refactoring the `updateDraftData` function. Initially, it updated the campaign brief and then updated local state.  This was changed to first update the campaign brief on the backend using `userService.put`, then refetch the updated data using `userService.get` to ensure data consistency.  This three-step process (update, fetch, update local state) improves reliability.


* **HTML to Plain Text Conversion (5:55 PM - 6:02 PM):**  A new utility function, `htmlToPlainText`, was introduced and integrated into `EmailPreview.jsx`. This function converts HTML content to plain text, improving the handling of rich text in the campaign brief (`draftData?.draftData?.campBrief`). This addressed a potential issue with HTML tags in the brief causing problems.


* **Removal of commented out code (6:12 PM & 6:16 PM):**  Two commits completely commented out the entire `EmailPreview` component.


* **UI Enhancements and Email Signature (11:19 PM):** The final revision significantly altered the UI, separating the campaign brief and email signature into distinct textareas. It also added labels for clarity and improved the input placeholder text. The `generateEmailTemplate` function was modified to accept and include the email signature.  The length limit for the campaign brief was changed from 2000 characters to 3000.


**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Socion\social\src\components\Social\htmlToPlainText.jsx`**

* **Creation (5:56 PM):** A new file (`htmlToPlainText.jsx`) was added, containing a utility function for converting HTML to plain text.  This function handles various HTML elements like paragraphs, lists, and line breaks (`<br>`), creating well-formatted plain text output.

The overall pattern in the `EmailPreview.jsx` changes is a move towards robustness, improved data handling, and a more user-friendly interface. The addition of the `htmlToPlainText` utility shows a focus on solving potential data inconsistencies and ensuring that the application handles rich text data in campaign brief more reliably. The final commented-out state indicates a potential rollback or temporary removal of the component from the project, though the last commit shows an updated version.
