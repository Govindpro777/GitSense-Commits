# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 10:29:15 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `EmployeeManager.jsx` and `AddTeacher.jsx`.  `RadioBtn.jsx` also underwent changes, but the commented-out code suggests a complete rewrite rather than incremental changes.


`EmployeeManager.jsx` was updated twice within a minute (7/9/2025, 1:15:40 AM and 7/9/2025, 1:16:05 AM).  These changes seem minor, with the second commit potentially enabling the "Manage Branch" option in the `subMenusBranch` array which was commented out in the first commit. The core functionality of the component, which involves fetching user roles from localStorage and filtering navigation menus based on those roles, remains unchanged.


`AddTeacher.jsx` underwent several revisions between 7/9/2025, 10:07:20 AM and 7/9/2025, 10:18:29 AM.  All the revisions in this file are commented-out code, indicating a large-scale refactor or replacement of the component's implementation.  The commented code suggests a form for adding teachers with validation, including fields for name, email, mobile number, password, and branch selection, using react-hook-form and yup for validation.  There is also handling for loading states and password visibility.  The final version of this file lacks any code which can be summarized, meaning the final code for the file is empty.


`RadioBtn.jsx` was modified twice in quick succession (7/9/2025, 10:15:17 AM and 7/9/2025, 10:15:53 AM). The first version is entirely commented out, which suggests a complete replacement with the subsequent version. The final version shows a simplification of the radio button component, using a basic toggle switch instead of the more complex custom design initially present in the commented-out version.  The initial design used a highly customized toggle, this change might have been made due to performance issues or design preference change.


## 10:34:50 AM
The log shows modifications to `SocialLandingPage.jsx` and `SocialLogin.jsx` components between 9:37 AM and 10:18 AM on July 9, 2025.

`SocialLandingPage.jsx` initially rendered several other components (`Hero`, `WhyThisProduct`, `UseCases`, `Testimonials`, `CTASection`, `Footer`).  At 9:39 AM, a `SocialLogin` component was added to the render, integrating the login functionality into the landing page. No further changes were made to this file.

`SocialLogin.jsx` underwent extensive styling changes throughout the log.  The initial version (9:39 AM) was a basic login form.  Subsequent changes (9:41 AM - 9:51 AM) involved adjustments to background colors (`bg-[#F4BB3F33]`), opacity, border styles (`border border-red-500`),  container width (`max-w-md` to `max-w-xl` and back to `max-w-md`), and text styling (font sizes, colors, and weights).  Specifically, the `h2` element's styling was changed multiple times, experimenting with different font sizes and weights. The button's styling also received several updates, mostly in padding and background color. Finally, between 9:51 AM and 9:55 AM the border was removed from the main container and then from 9:55 AM to 10:18 AM the input fields and button were given more rounded corners.  The color of the placeholder text was also changed from grey to black at 9:55 AM.  The final changes, made around 10:18 AM, involved rounding the input fields' corners.  The overarching pattern in the modifications to `SocialLogin.jsx` is iterative styling adjustments, refining the visual appearance of the login form.


## 12:57:13 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `SocialLogin.jsx` between 11:57 AM and 12:26 PM on July 9, 2025, focusing primarily on styling and layout adjustments.  Early revisions involved significant restructuring of the component, transitioning from a simpler layout to one incorporating header, background images (`/assets/social-loginbg1.png`, `/assets/social-loginbg2.png`), a login form, and a footer with social media links.  The styling heavily uses Tailwind CSS classes.

Between 11:57 AM and 12:07 PM, changes centered on adjusting padding (`px-12`, `px-10`, `px-14`), adding background colors (`bg-[#F4BB3F33]`),  refining the form's visual aspects (button styles, input field borders), and adding a footer with social media icons and copyright information. The font size and weight were also adjusted in multiple revisions.

From 12:07 PM onwards, the focus shifted to the footer.  Social media icons were replaced with images, initially with `social1.svg`, `social2.svg`, `social3.svg` and later replaced with `socialblack-1.svg`, `socialblack-2.svg`, `socialblack-3.svg`.  The footer's layout and styling were refined, including the addition of `flex`, `justify-between`, `flex-wrap`, and `gap-4` classes.  The links in the footer remained mostly unchanged.  The file also had various margin adjustments (`mt-8`, `mt-10`, `mt-12`) and height settings (`min-h-[670px]`).  The `rounded` class values were changed several times. Finally, the input field text size was reduced to `text-sm` around 12:17 PM.

One noteworthy change occurred at 12:21 PM where two social media links in the footer were updated to direct to the X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram pages for "goskribe".

A separate component, `UseCases.jsx`, was also modified.  The most significant change made between 12:52 PM and 12:54 PM was the adjustment of image height within the `Use Cases` section from `h-full` to `h-[169PX]`, then reverted back to `h-full` in the final revision.  This component displays use cases with images and descriptions, using a responsive grid layout.


The overall pattern in the `SocialLogin.jsx` changes reflects iterative design improvements, focusing on visual appeal and responsiveness.  The changes to the `UseCases.jsx` are less frequent and less extensive.


## 2:56:18 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to components of a Next.js frontend for a social media influencer marketing platform, specifically focusing on the styling and layout of the `Hero`, `WhyThisProduct`, and `UseCases` sections of a social landing page.  Changes were made between 2:24 PM and 2:53 PM on July 9th, 2025.

**`Hero.jsx`**: This file, modified once at 2:24:58 PM, contains the main hero section of the landing page.  The code defines the styling and layout of the hero section including a background image, header with logo and "Get Early Access" button, and a main section with headline, description, features list and multiple influencer images. The styling uses Tailwind CSS.


**`WhyThisProduct.jsx`**: This component underwent substantial revision between 2:25:57 PM and 2:51:57 PM.  The initial version displayed key product features with icons and titles in a grid layout.  Subsequent changes focused primarily on refining the styling:  adjusting padding (`p-8` to `p-10`, then `p-4` and back to `p-10`), altering the `max-w` of the section container (from `1000px` to `1030px`), modifying the font sizes of headings (`text-[28px]` to `text-[24px]`, `text-[32px]`, `text-[36px]` depending on screen size), and adjusting the top padding (`py-20` to `pt-14` then `pt-20`).  The final change involved making the bottom border conditional based on screen size, using `hidden md:block`.


**`UseCases.jsx`**:  This file, representing the use cases section, was also heavily modified between 2:26:48 PM and 2:53:01 PM. Similar to `WhyThisProduct.jsx`, the changes concentrated on the styling, specifically padding (`p-8` to `p-6`), container width (`max-w-[1100px]` to `max-w-6xl`), heading font size (`text-[36px]` to `text-[28px]`, `text-[32px]`, `text-[36px]` ), and paragraph text size (`text-md` to `text-sm` then `text-md`). A border was added and later removed from the main section div.  Finally, the gap between grid items was adjusted for better spacing on different screen sizes.


**Recurring Patterns**:  The changes across all files consistently involved adjustments to padding, font sizes, and responsiveness (using Tailwind CSS's screen size modifiers like `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`).  This suggests iterative design refinements and responsiveness improvements during development.  The repeated use of specific color codes (`#E96D70`, `#1A0F0F`, `#FFF8EF`, `#F2EAD8`, `#00000033`) shows a consistent design language.
