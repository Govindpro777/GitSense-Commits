# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 10:29:15 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `EmployeeManager.jsx` and `AddTeacher.jsx`.  `RadioBtn.jsx` also underwent changes, but the commented-out code suggests a complete rewrite rather than incremental changes.


`EmployeeManager.jsx` was updated twice within a minute (7/9/2025, 1:15:40 AM and 7/9/2025, 1:16:05 AM).  These changes seem minor, with the second commit potentially enabling the "Manage Branch" option in the `subMenusBranch` array which was commented out in the first commit. The core functionality of the component, which involves fetching user roles from localStorage and filtering navigation menus based on those roles, remains unchanged.


`AddTeacher.jsx` underwent several revisions between 7/9/2025, 10:07:20 AM and 7/9/2025, 10:18:29 AM.  All the revisions in this file are commented-out code, indicating a large-scale refactor or replacement of the component's implementation.  The commented code suggests a form for adding teachers with validation, including fields for name, email, mobile number, password, and branch selection, using react-hook-form and yup for validation.  There is also handling for loading states and password visibility.  The final version of this file lacks any code which can be summarized, meaning the final code for the file is empty.


`RadioBtn.jsx` was modified twice in quick succession (7/9/2025, 10:15:17 AM and 7/9/2025, 10:15:53 AM). The first version is entirely commented out, which suggests a complete replacement with the subsequent version. The final version shows a simplification of the radio button component, using a basic toggle switch instead of the more complex custom design initially present in the commented-out version.  The initial design used a highly customized toggle, this change might have been made due to performance issues or design preference change.


## 10:34:50 AM
The log shows modifications to `SocialLandingPage.jsx` and `SocialLogin.jsx` components between 9:37 AM and 10:18 AM on July 9, 2025.

`SocialLandingPage.jsx` initially rendered several other components (`Hero`, `WhyThisProduct`, `UseCases`, `Testimonials`, `CTASection`, `Footer`).  At 9:39 AM, a `SocialLogin` component was added to the render, integrating the login functionality into the landing page. No further changes were made to this file.

`SocialLogin.jsx` underwent extensive styling changes throughout the log.  The initial version (9:39 AM) was a basic login form.  Subsequent changes (9:41 AM - 9:51 AM) involved adjustments to background colors (`bg-[#F4BB3F33]`), opacity, border styles (`border border-red-500`),  container width (`max-w-md` to `max-w-xl` and back to `max-w-md`), and text styling (font sizes, colors, and weights).  Specifically, the `h2` element's styling was changed multiple times, experimenting with different font sizes and weights. The button's styling also received several updates, mostly in padding and background color. Finally, between 9:51 AM and 9:55 AM the border was removed from the main container and then from 9:55 AM to 10:18 AM the input fields and button were given more rounded corners.  The color of the placeholder text was also changed from grey to black at 9:55 AM.  The final changes, made around 10:18 AM, involved rounding the input fields' corners.  The overarching pattern in the modifications to `SocialLogin.jsx` is iterative styling adjustments, refining the visual appearance of the login form.
