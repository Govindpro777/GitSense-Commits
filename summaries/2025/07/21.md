# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 12:36:55 AM
The `CreateCampaign.jsx` component was updated on July 20, 2025, at 11:42:39 PM.  This component is a React form for creating social media campaigns.  The update includes:

* **Form Handling:**  Improved form handling with `useState` for managing form data, button click state, and dropdown state.  Input validation ensures required fields (`title` and `description`) are filled before submission.

* **API Interaction:** Uses `userService.post` to send campaign data (including user information from `localStorage`) to an API endpoint (`SOCIAL_CAMPAIGN_CREATION`).  Error handling is implemented with a `try...catch` block and displays notifications using `useNotification`.  The response from the API determines whether the campaign creation was successful or if the campaign name already exists.  Successful creation redirects to `/discover-influencers/{id}`.

* **UI Enhancements:** The UI is built using a modern CSS framework (likely Tailwind CSS).  The form includes input fields for title, budget, brand name, brand goals (with a dropdown), start and end dates, and a description.  A visually appealing breadcrumb navigation is present at the top.  Clear visual feedback is provided for form validation and button states.  The character count for the description field is displayed.

* **Date Handling:**  Start and end dates are handled, with the end date minimum set dynamically based on the start date.

* **Brand Goals:**  A dropdown menu facilitates the selection of brand goals from a predefined list (`brandGoals`).


The code demonstrates a well-structured React component with robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.  The use of `localStorage` for retrieving user information suggests integration with a user authentication system.


## 1:36:55 AM
The log shows changes to two React components: `CreateCampaign.jsx` and `EmailPreview.jsx`.

`CreateCampaign.jsx` (7/21/2025, 12:55:57 AM): This component, updated at 12:55:57 AM, is a form for creating social media campaigns.  It includes fields for title, budget, brand name, brand goals (with a dropdown), start and end dates, and a description.  The form submits data to a backend service (`userService.post`) using a payload that includes user information from `localStorage`.  Error handling and success notifications are implemented using a `useNotification` hook.  The form uses Tailwind CSS for styling.  There are two almost identical `handleApi` and `handleButtonClick` functions, which differ very slightly.


`EmailPreview.jsx` (7/21/2025, 1:10:28 AM): This component, updated later at 1:10:28 AM, is commented out entirely. It appears to have been a component for previewing emails related to a campaign.  The commented-out code suggests functionality for displaying and editing email content, managing attachments, and interacting with a backend service (`userService`) for retrieving and updating draft data using constants like `GET_DRAFT_DATA` and `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`.  It also incorporates a loading indicator and error handling.  The component likely used a similar notification system to `CreateCampaign.jsx`.  The large amount of commented-out code suggests it may be undergoing significant changes or has been temporarily disabled.


## 11:27:35 AM
The log shows iterative changes to `index1.html`, a newsletter HTML file, over a short period on July 21, 2025.  The primary focus of the updates is refining the newsletter's visual design and structure.

Initial changes (10:35:58 AM) involved setting up the basic HTML structure, incorporating external stylesheets for fonts (`Typekit` and `Google Fonts`), and defining basic CSS styles for responsiveness and font consistency. The content at this stage was a placeholder June 2025 newsletter.

Subsequent changes (10:43:15 AM - 11:26:53 AM) focused on content updates and major layout improvements. The title changed from "June 2025 Newsletter" to "Skribe Newsletter," then to "Skribe Weekly".  The main headline and body copy were significantly revised to focus on Skribe's paid press release distribution service, highlighting its speed, guaranteed coverage, and transparent pricing. The newsletter transitioned from a monthly digest to a focus on this paid service.  The structure was reorganized into distinct sections (Header, Main Content, Features, Call to Action, Examples, Divider, Footer, and Unsubscribe).


Several changes involved minor tweaks to styling and layout elements like padding, margins, font sizes,  and the height of header sections (10:45:03 AM, 10:45:32 AM, 10:45:51 AM, 10:46:07 AM, 10:47:05 AM, 10:49:28 AM, 10:49:36 AM, 10:51:06 AM, 10:51:22 AM, 10:53:03 AM, 10:53:41 AM, 11:00:24 AM, 11:06:03 AM, 11:06:11 AM, 11:06:54 AM, 11:13:40 AM, 11:14:25 AM, 11:20:19 AM, 11:22:38 AM, 11:22:55 AM, 11:23:14 AM, 11:23:44 AM, 11:24:02 AM, 11:25:35 AM, 11:26:53 AM).  These iterations demonstrate a refinement process for the visual presentation of the newsletter's content.

A significant change occurred around 11:00:24 AM. The HTML structure was significantly simplified using inline styling and attributes, removing some nested tables. This  resulted in a cleaner and more concise code structure. The background color was moved from inline styling in the `<body>` tag to the main table's `bgcolor` attribute. The header image was also changed to use the `object-fit: cover;` style for better image scaling.  Finally the image source for the social media icons in the footer were changed to blue-themed versions at 11:25:35 AM.


The most substantial alterations were made to the content, transitioning the newsletter's purpose. The consistent use of the color codes (`#002B5B`, `#0A4C86`, `#374151`, `#f5f5f5`, `#ccc`) shows a deliberate color scheme throughout the design.  The final version, around 11:26:53 AM, represents a polished newsletter focusing on the paid press release service, reflecting a streamlined visual presentation and clear call-to-action elements.  `index2.html` shows a very similar final version created around 11:05:35 AM suggesting a branching approach to finalizing the newsletter design.


## 12:27:33 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `index1.html` between 11:27 AM and 12:23 PM on July 21, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes was refining the layout and styling of an email newsletter.

Initially, the HTML was a basic structure.  Subsequent changes involved:

* **Image additions:**  Multiple image sources (`https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/*`, `https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/*`) were added throughout the email for branding and visual appeal.  Specifically, images for social media icons, a logo, and a graphic element were introduced. One change included adding a 'newPress' image and experimenting with its placement within the email.

* **Styling adjustments:**  Numerous small modifications to the CSS styling were made to adjust font sizes, colors (`#002B5B`, `#374151`, `#0A4C86`, `#ccc`, `#f5f5f5`), margins, padding, font families (`Poppins`, `Canva Sans`, `Work Sans`), text alignment, and the use of underline styles in links. A new class, `.canva-sans-heading`, was added to specifically style headings using the 'Work Sans' font. The `font-weight` of the main heading was altered from 700 to 600. The `h1` tag's font-family was modified to include 'Canva Sans'.

* **Layout restructuring:** The initial layout used nested tables. The changes included shifting from a more linear structure to a side-by-side table layout for the greeting section and image, implying an improvement in visual presentation.  Further changes involved minor adjustments to spacing and the positions of various elements within the tables. The margin for different sections were modified between 20px and 6px.


* **Link modifications:**  Several placeholders (`href="#"`) were replaced with actual links to WhatsApp, Calendly, and a Google Drive file hosting an "Enterprise Deck". The links for the examples were updated with working links.


The majority of changes were made in a short burst between 11:30 AM and 11:41 AM, suggesting a period of intensive work on the layout and image integration.  Later edits, from 12:00 PM onwards, focused primarily on stylistic refinements and the addition of active links to external resources.  The consistent use of inline styles within the HTML suggests a focus on granular control over the email's appearance.


## 1:27:36 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `index1.html` and `index2.html`, both HTML files likely representing email templates.  The changes primarily focus on styling and layout adjustments, with a recurring theme of refining the visual presentation of the email content.

`index1.html` underwent the most revisions.  Early changes (around 12:37 PM) involved adjustments to the header's `margin` property for the main heading,  indicating a focus on spacing and alignment. Later revisions (between 12:40 PM and 1:00 PM) involved a significant restructuring of the header section, moving from a nested table structure to a simpler design using background images and reducing the number of nested tables.  A final change around 1:17 PM reverted to the initial heading structure and text, suggesting potential A/B testing or a decision to return to the original version.  The link to the "Enterprise Deck" was also updated to a different Google Drive link at 12:52 PM.

`index2.html`  shows a consistent effort to simplify the email structure, mirroring the changes made to `index1.html`.  The most significant changes involved removing commented-out code and modifying the header section to be more concise and visually appealing, similar to the transformations in `index1.html` but focused on a different headline.  Between 1:02 PM and 1:20 PM, the header was significantly altered, changing from using nested tables to a single header element with a background image. The headline was also changed multiple times, and the alignment of the logo and header text changed multiple times, before settling around 1:20 PM.  Another notable change was shifting the social media links to the center at 1:07 PM.

A common pattern across both files involves the consistent use of tables for layout, inline styling, and embedded image URLs for the header and icons. The color scheme (#002B5B, #374151, #f5f5f5) remains consistent throughout.  The changes suggest an iterative design process aiming for a cleaner and more effective email layout. The time period covered by the log is approximately one hour, indicating a period of intense work on refining the email templates.


## 2:27:42 PM
The log shows iterative changes to two HTML files, `index1.html` and `index2.html`,  both seemingly email templates for Skribe, a PR distribution service.  The modifications primarily involve adjustments to styling, content, and layout.

`index1.html`  underwent numerous revisions between 1:27 PM and 2:03 PM.  The main changes focused on the header's heading size and alignment, consistently reducing the `font-size` of the main heading (`<h1>`) from 26px to 20px, and shifting the text alignment from left to center. The changes also involved minor adjustments to margins within the `<h1>` element and the overall layout to improve formatting and responsiveness.  The  `<a>` tags within the `<ul>` elements were altered multiple times, with styling adjustments to underline links. There were also changes in the styling of the `<a>` tag in the "Prefer a quick chat?" section, changing the location of `text-decoration: underline;`

`index2.html` was modified between 1:29 PM and 2:05 PM. The most significant changes in this file were in the content.  The initial version focused on  "Distribute to 200+ publications..." while later versions switched to a message for agencies, mentioning "Running PR for multiple clients? We make launches easy."  The changes to `index2.html` also involved subtle modifications to the spacing (`margin`) in the heading (`<h1>`)  and the placement of the image (making the image move to a separate table inside the initial one). Similar to `index1.html`, the `<a>` tags within the call-to-action section also saw changes in the `text-decoration: underline;` styling. Finally, the link to the "Agency Deck" replaced the "Enterprise Deck" link in the call-to-action section.

A recurring pattern across both files is the use of nested tables for layout,  consistent styling choices (fonts, colors), and the inclusion of social media links in the footer.  The overall modification pattern suggests an effort to refine the email templates for clarity, readability, and better visual appeal.


## 3:27:23 PM
The log shows modifications to two HTML files, `index1.html` and `index2.html`, representing email templates, likely for different user segments (Enterprise vs. Agency).  The changes primarily involve text updates and minor styling adjustments.

`index1.html` (Enterprise): The initial version of `index1.html` (2:30:28 PM) is a newsletter-style email showcasing Skribe's paid press release service. A later version (2:59:18 PM) and a final version (3:15:26 PM) updates the `<title>` tag to "Enterprise Deck," suggesting a refocusing on presenting a deck instead of a standard newsletter format. The main content remains largely the same in subsequent versions.  The most noticeable change between the first and subsequent versions is the removal of commented-out code and a change in the header image and overall layout of the header section, moving it from a left-aligned to center-aligned layout.

`index2.html` (Agency): This file's initial version (2:55:44 PM) targets agencies, highlighting how Skribe streamlines press release distribution for multiple clients. A final version (3:15:51 PM) makes minimal alterations, primarily focusing on minor text adjustments and maintaining the structure of the agency-focused email.  The title is consistently "Agency Deck".  The main structural change is the removal of commented-out code, similar to the `index1.html` updates.

A recurring pattern is the consistent use of a table-based layout for structuring the email content, and a consistent use of the same social media links in the footer across both files.  The  `index1.html` file, however, undergoes more significant changes in layout compared to `index2.html`, reflecting a shift in its purpose from newsletter to a deck presentation.  The link to the Enterprise Deck in `index1.html` is corrected from a Google Drive link to a direct PDF link within the beta-app.  Similarly, the Agency Deck link is added in `index2.html`.


## 5:02:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EmailPreview.jsx` between 4:10 PM and 5:01 PM on July 21, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: fetching draft data using `userService.get`, generating an email preview based on that data, and allowing for editing of the campaign brief.  The edits primarily focus on the UI rendering of the component.

Initially, the code was largely commented out.  Between 4:10 PM and 4:14 PM, the commenting gradually decreased until the code was mostly uncommented, revealing a React component that displays email previews, allowing users to edit campaign briefs and remove attachments.  Significant changes around 4:39 PM and later involve adding a substantial UI rendering section with JSX to display a more detailed email preview with editable campaign brief section and attachment handling.  

A notable change at 4:42 PM involved the introduction of a `convertHtmlToPlainText` function, which replaces the simple regex used for converting HTML to plain text in previous versions, suggesting a more robust HTML sanitization approach was implemented.  The final change at 5:01 PM imports a function `htmlToPlainText` from a different file path, indicating that the HTML-to-plain-text conversion logic was likely refactored into a separate, reusable function for better code organization and maintainability.  The structure of the component and the core functions remain unchanged during the last edits.
