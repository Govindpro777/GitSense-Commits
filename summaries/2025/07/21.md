# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 12:36:55 AM
The `CreateCampaign.jsx` component was updated on July 20, 2025, at 11:42:39 PM.  This component is a React form for creating social media campaigns.  The update includes:

* **Form Handling:**  Improved form handling with `useState` for managing form data, button click state, and dropdown state.  Input validation ensures required fields (`title` and `description`) are filled before submission.

* **API Interaction:** Uses `userService.post` to send campaign data (including user information from `localStorage`) to an API endpoint (`SOCIAL_CAMPAIGN_CREATION`).  Error handling is implemented with a `try...catch` block and displays notifications using `useNotification`.  The response from the API determines whether the campaign creation was successful or if the campaign name already exists.  Successful creation redirects to `/discover-influencers/{id}`.

* **UI Enhancements:** The UI is built using a modern CSS framework (likely Tailwind CSS).  The form includes input fields for title, budget, brand name, brand goals (with a dropdown), start and end dates, and a description.  A visually appealing breadcrumb navigation is present at the top.  Clear visual feedback is provided for form validation and button states.  The character count for the description field is displayed.

* **Date Handling:**  Start and end dates are handled, with the end date minimum set dynamically based on the start date.

* **Brand Goals:**  A dropdown menu facilitates the selection of brand goals from a predefined list (`brandGoals`).


The code demonstrates a well-structured React component with robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.  The use of `localStorage` for retrieving user information suggests integration with a user authentication system.


## 1:36:55 AM
The log shows changes to two React components: `CreateCampaign.jsx` and `EmailPreview.jsx`.

`CreateCampaign.jsx` (7/21/2025, 12:55:57 AM): This component, updated at 12:55:57 AM, is a form for creating social media campaigns.  It includes fields for title, budget, brand name, brand goals (with a dropdown), start and end dates, and a description.  The form submits data to a backend service (`userService.post`) using a payload that includes user information from `localStorage`.  Error handling and success notifications are implemented using a `useNotification` hook.  The form uses Tailwind CSS for styling.  There are two almost identical `handleApi` and `handleButtonClick` functions, which differ very slightly.


`EmailPreview.jsx` (7/21/2025, 1:10:28 AM): This component, updated later at 1:10:28 AM, is commented out entirely. It appears to have been a component for previewing emails related to a campaign.  The commented-out code suggests functionality for displaying and editing email content, managing attachments, and interacting with a backend service (`userService`) for retrieving and updating draft data using constants like `GET_DRAFT_DATA` and `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`.  It also incorporates a loading indicator and error handling.  The component likely used a similar notification system to `CreateCampaign.jsx`.  The large amount of commented-out code suggests it may be undergoing significant changes or has been temporarily disabled.


## 11:27:35 AM
The log shows iterative changes to `index1.html`, a newsletter HTML file, over a short period on July 21, 2025.  The primary focus of the updates is refining the newsletter's visual design and structure.

Initial changes (10:35:58 AM) involved setting up the basic HTML structure, incorporating external stylesheets for fonts (`Typekit` and `Google Fonts`), and defining basic CSS styles for responsiveness and font consistency. The content at this stage was a placeholder June 2025 newsletter.

Subsequent changes (10:43:15 AM - 11:26:53 AM) focused on content updates and major layout improvements. The title changed from "June 2025 Newsletter" to "Skribe Newsletter," then to "Skribe Weekly".  The main headline and body copy were significantly revised to focus on Skribe's paid press release distribution service, highlighting its speed, guaranteed coverage, and transparent pricing. The newsletter transitioned from a monthly digest to a focus on this paid service.  The structure was reorganized into distinct sections (Header, Main Content, Features, Call to Action, Examples, Divider, Footer, and Unsubscribe).


Several changes involved minor tweaks to styling and layout elements like padding, margins, font sizes,  and the height of header sections (10:45:03 AM, 10:45:32 AM, 10:45:51 AM, 10:46:07 AM, 10:47:05 AM, 10:49:28 AM, 10:49:36 AM, 10:51:06 AM, 10:51:22 AM, 10:53:03 AM, 10:53:41 AM, 11:00:24 AM, 11:06:03 AM, 11:06:11 AM, 11:06:54 AM, 11:13:40 AM, 11:14:25 AM, 11:20:19 AM, 11:22:38 AM, 11:22:55 AM, 11:23:14 AM, 11:23:44 AM, 11:24:02 AM, 11:25:35 AM, 11:26:53 AM).  These iterations demonstrate a refinement process for the visual presentation of the newsletter's content.

A significant change occurred around 11:00:24 AM. The HTML structure was significantly simplified using inline styling and attributes, removing some nested tables. This  resulted in a cleaner and more concise code structure. The background color was moved from inline styling in the `<body>` tag to the main table's `bgcolor` attribute. The header image was also changed to use the `object-fit: cover;` style for better image scaling.  Finally the image source for the social media icons in the footer were changed to blue-themed versions at 11:25:35 AM.


The most substantial alterations were made to the content, transitioning the newsletter's purpose. The consistent use of the color codes (`#002B5B`, `#0A4C86`, `#374151`, `#f5f5f5`, `#ccc`) shows a deliberate color scheme throughout the design.  The final version, around 11:26:53 AM, represents a polished newsletter focusing on the paid press release service, reflecting a streamlined visual presentation and clear call-to-action elements.  `index2.html` shows a very similar final version created around 11:05:35 AM suggesting a branching approach to finalizing the newsletter design.
