# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 12:36:55 AM
The `CreateCampaign.jsx` component was updated on July 20, 2025, at 11:42:39 PM.  This component is a React form for creating social media campaigns.  The update includes:

* **Form Handling:**  Improved form handling with `useState` for managing form data, button click state, and dropdown state.  Input validation ensures required fields (`title` and `description`) are filled before submission.

* **API Interaction:** Uses `userService.post` to send campaign data (including user information from `localStorage`) to an API endpoint (`SOCIAL_CAMPAIGN_CREATION`).  Error handling is implemented with a `try...catch` block and displays notifications using `useNotification`.  The response from the API determines whether the campaign creation was successful or if the campaign name already exists.  Successful creation redirects to `/discover-influencers/{id}`.

* **UI Enhancements:** The UI is built using a modern CSS framework (likely Tailwind CSS).  The form includes input fields for title, budget, brand name, brand goals (with a dropdown), start and end dates, and a description.  A visually appealing breadcrumb navigation is present at the top.  Clear visual feedback is provided for form validation and button states.  The character count for the description field is displayed.

* **Date Handling:**  Start and end dates are handled, with the end date minimum set dynamically based on the start date.

* **Brand Goals:**  A dropdown menu facilitates the selection of brand goals from a predefined list (`brandGoals`).


The code demonstrates a well-structured React component with robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.  The use of `localStorage` for retrieving user information suggests integration with a user authentication system.
