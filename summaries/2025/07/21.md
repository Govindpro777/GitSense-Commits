# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 12:36:55 AM
The `CreateCampaign.jsx` component was updated on July 20, 2025, at 11:42:39 PM.  This component is a React form for creating social media campaigns.  The update includes:

* **Form Handling:**  Improved form handling with `useState` for managing form data, button click state, and dropdown state.  Input validation ensures required fields (`title` and `description`) are filled before submission.

* **API Interaction:** Uses `userService.post` to send campaign data (including user information from `localStorage`) to an API endpoint (`SOCIAL_CAMPAIGN_CREATION`).  Error handling is implemented with a `try...catch` block and displays notifications using `useNotification`.  The response from the API determines whether the campaign creation was successful or if the campaign name already exists.  Successful creation redirects to `/discover-influencers/{id}`.

* **UI Enhancements:** The UI is built using a modern CSS framework (likely Tailwind CSS).  The form includes input fields for title, budget, brand name, brand goals (with a dropdown), start and end dates, and a description.  A visually appealing breadcrumb navigation is present at the top.  Clear visual feedback is provided for form validation and button states.  The character count for the description field is displayed.

* **Date Handling:**  Start and end dates are handled, with the end date minimum set dynamically based on the start date.

* **Brand Goals:**  A dropdown menu facilitates the selection of brand goals from a predefined list (`brandGoals`).


The code demonstrates a well-structured React component with robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.  The use of `localStorage` for retrieving user information suggests integration with a user authentication system.


## 1:36:55 AM
The log shows changes to two React components: `CreateCampaign.jsx` and `EmailPreview.jsx`.

`CreateCampaign.jsx` (7/21/2025, 12:55:57 AM): This component, updated at 12:55:57 AM, is a form for creating social media campaigns.  It includes fields for title, budget, brand name, brand goals (with a dropdown), start and end dates, and a description.  The form submits data to a backend service (`userService.post`) using a payload that includes user information from `localStorage`.  Error handling and success notifications are implemented using a `useNotification` hook.  The form uses Tailwind CSS for styling.  There are two almost identical `handleApi` and `handleButtonClick` functions, which differ very slightly.


`EmailPreview.jsx` (7/21/2025, 1:10:28 AM): This component, updated later at 1:10:28 AM, is commented out entirely. It appears to have been a component for previewing emails related to a campaign.  The commented-out code suggests functionality for displaying and editing email content, managing attachments, and interacting with a backend service (`userService`) for retrieving and updating draft data using constants like `GET_DRAFT_DATA` and `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`.  It also incorporates a loading indicator and error handling.  The component likely used a similar notification system to `CreateCampaign.jsx`.  The large amount of commented-out code suggests it may be undergoing significant changes or has been temporarily disabled.
