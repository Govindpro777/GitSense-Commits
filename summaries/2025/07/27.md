# Activity Summary for 7/27/2025

## 11:45:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Register.jsx` file within the `ERP_FRONTEND` component of an ERP CRM application.  The key changes are focused on the  `handleSignupResponse` function.

The first entry (4:24:10 PM) includes a large `handleSignupResponse` function that processes responses from a signup API call.  This function uses the response status to determine actions like showing notifications, navigating to different pages (`/summary`, `/login`), and handling different signup scenarios (successful registration, user already exists, OTP related actions, etc.).  The function uses `localStorage` to store user information after a successful signup.

The second and third entries (4:25:59 PM and 4:32:49 PM) remove the `handleSignupResponse` function entirely. This suggests the function's logic might have been moved elsewhere or refactored, or perhaps a decision was made to remove the handling of various response codes from this component. The rest of the `Register.jsx` file remains consistent across all revisions, indicating no other substantial changes.  The core registration form using Ant Design components and Redux for state management remains unchanged.


## 11:45:57 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions of `Signup.jsx` between 4:21 PM and 4:26 PM on July 27, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and likely debugging or refining of the existing code rather than substantial feature additions.  The code implements a user signup component with OTP verification and early access functionality.  There's consistent use of `useState` hooks to manage component state, including user input, loading indicators, and error handling.  The `userService` is used for API calls to handle signup requests and fetching early access information.  Input validation checks are in place for organization name, name, email (disallowing public email providers unless early access is granted), phone number, and password complexity.  A commented-out `handleSignupResponse` function suggests that different response statuses from the signup API are handled, although the complete logic is not present in the final version.  The code removes any existing user data from local storage upon component mount.  The repeated identical code across revisions indicates the edits might have been in an unrelated part of the file that wasn't included in the log or there were some failed attempts which did not change the content of the file.
