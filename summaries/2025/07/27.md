# Activity Summary for 7/27/2025

## 11:45:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Register.jsx` file within the `ERP_FRONTEND` component of an ERP CRM application.  The key changes are focused on the  `handleSignupResponse` function.

The first entry (4:24:10 PM) includes a large `handleSignupResponse` function that processes responses from a signup API call.  This function uses the response status to determine actions like showing notifications, navigating to different pages (`/summary`, `/login`), and handling different signup scenarios (successful registration, user already exists, OTP related actions, etc.).  The function uses `localStorage` to store user information after a successful signup.

The second and third entries (4:25:59 PM and 4:32:49 PM) remove the `handleSignupResponse` function entirely. This suggests the function's logic might have been moved elsewhere or refactored, or perhaps a decision was made to remove the handling of various response codes from this component. The rest of the `Register.jsx` file remains consistent across all revisions, indicating no other substantial changes.  The core registration form using Ant Design components and Redux for state management remains unchanged.
