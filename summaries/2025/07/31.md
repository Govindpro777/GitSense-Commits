# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 12:22:52 AM
The log shows several code changes across frontend and backend `.env` files and the `Leads.jsx` and `errorHandler.js` files in the frontend.

On July 30th, 2025, the `index.jsx` file (10:23:59 PM) was updated to export five layout components (`CrudLayout`, `ErpLayout`, `DefaultLayout`, `DashboardLayout`, and `SettingsLayout`).  The `.env` files for both frontend and backend were modified multiple times between 10:44:04 PM and 11:12:31 PM, primarily updating environment variables related to the database connection string,  Resend API key, JWT secret, server port, and Cloudinary configuration. The port number in the backend `.env` file changed from 3000 to 8888 and back to 3000.  The frontend `.env` file shows changes in `VITE_FILE_BASE_URL` switching between `http://localhost:3000/` and `http://localhost:8888/`, suggesting testing with different local server ports.

On July 31st, 2025, the `Leads.jsx` file was modified multiple times between 12:16:13 AM and 12:16:35 AM. These changes appear to be minor and inconsequential, likely just commented-out code.

The `errorHandler.js` file underwent significant changes between 12:12:30 AM and 12:22:25 AM. The initial version had incomplete error handling and displayed redundant notifications.  The final version implements robust error handling, including checks for JWT validity and expiry. It now validates stored tokens (`auth` and `token`) using a helper function `validateStoredToken` and incorporates `isValidJWTFormat` for checking the correct JWT structure, clearing auth data upon detecting invalid or expired tokens, and redirecting to the login page.  The error handling is improved to provide more informative messages and better manage different error scenarios (network issues, server errors, JWT errors).  The structure of the errorHandler was significantly improved and became more efficient.
