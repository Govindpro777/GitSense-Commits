# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 12:22:52 AM
The log shows several code changes across frontend and backend `.env` files and the `Leads.jsx` and `errorHandler.js` files in the frontend.

On July 30th, 2025, the `index.jsx` file (10:23:59 PM) was updated to export five layout components (`CrudLayout`, `ErpLayout`, `DefaultLayout`, `DashboardLayout`, and `SettingsLayout`).  The `.env` files for both frontend and backend were modified multiple times between 10:44:04 PM and 11:12:31 PM, primarily updating environment variables related to the database connection string,  Resend API key, JWT secret, server port, and Cloudinary configuration. The port number in the backend `.env` file changed from 3000 to 8888 and back to 3000.  The frontend `.env` file shows changes in `VITE_FILE_BASE_URL` switching between `http://localhost:3000/` and `http://localhost:8888/`, suggesting testing with different local server ports.

On July 31st, 2025, the `Leads.jsx` file was modified multiple times between 12:16:13 AM and 12:16:35 AM. These changes appear to be minor and inconsequential, likely just commented-out code.

The `errorHandler.js` file underwent significant changes between 12:12:30 AM and 12:22:25 AM. The initial version had incomplete error handling and displayed redundant notifications.  The final version implements robust error handling, including checks for JWT validity and expiry. It now validates stored tokens (`auth` and `token`) using a helper function `validateStoredToken` and incorporates `isValidJWTFormat` for checking the correct JWT structure, clearing auth data upon detecting invalid or expired tokens, and redirecting to the login page.  The error handling is improved to provide more informative messages and better manage different error scenarios (network issues, server errors, JWT errors).  The structure of the errorHandler was significantly improved and became more efficient.


## 4:18:19 PM
The log shows several revisions to `ImageUploader.js` and `graphics.controller.js` on July 31st, 2025.

`ImageUploader.js` underwent multiple edits, primarily focusing on the `localFileUpload` function.  Initially, the function was complete, then commented out, then restored, and finally significantly enhanced. The most substantial change (4:13:09 PM) involved adding unique filename generation to prevent conflicts,  sanitizing filenames, adding file size warnings for files larger than 100MB, and improving error handling by verifying file creation.  Logging was also added to track the number of files uploaded and their total size.  The pattern shows a process of iterative development and improvement of the file upload functionality.


`graphics.controller.js` shows a long commented-out `createOrder` function and a partially visible, updated `createOrder` function. The commented-out code suggests an older version of the order creation logic. The new `createOrder` function, in progress across multiple timestamps (4:13:55 PM, 4:15:19 PM, 4:16:21 PM, 4:16:50 PM) is being developed to improve order creation.  It includes validation of required fields and handling of both existing and new customer IDs.  The function leverages the `localFileUpload` function from `ImageUploader.js` for image uploads.  There's also evidence of integrating user notifications using the `sendAssignmentNotification` function and managing order assignments with `findAvailableGraphicsUser`. This controller appears to handle order creation, assignment, and potentially notification workflows.


## 4:24:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `SPOTLIGHTAGENCY2.html` on July 31st, 2025, between 3:25 PM and 3:28 PM.  The file is an HTML email template.  The main changes are in the examples section near the bottom.

The initial version (3:25:15 PM) contained direct links to articles, while subsequent versions (starting 3:27:01 PM) replaced the links with more general descriptions. For example,  a link to a Smile Train India article on Hindustan Times was changed to simply "A leading non-profit was recently featured in Hindustan Times".  This pattern of changing the article links to summary descriptions continued in subsequent commits, with a further change  to one of the links in the last version (3:27:53 PM). One link to an article on Business Today was changed to a link to an article on Mid-Day.  The remaining content and styling of the email template remained consistent across all revisions.


## 5:18:19 PM
The log shows updates to two files within a Node.js backend application.

**`graphics.controller.js` (7/31/2025, 4:52:57 PM and later):** This file manages order creation and assignment to graphics users.  The initial commit includes functions for finding available graphics users, sending assignment notifications via websockets, calculating order priority and estimated completion time.  A significant change occurred later (the second entry is identical to the third, so only one meaningful update is present).  The `createOrder` function was significantly refactored.  The original version used a transaction to create an order and associated work queue item, handling order assignment and notifications. The revised `createOrder` function now includes more robust validation, specifically checking for mandatory fields (requirements, dimensions, and images), and adding error handling for missing or invalid customer IDs.  It also handles both creating new customers and using existing ones.


**`ImageUploader.js` (7/31/2025, 4:59:35 PM and 7/31/2025, 5:02:32 PM):** This file handles local file uploads. The first update introduces a basic local file upload function using `express-fileupload`. The second update improves the `localFileUpload` function by adding:

*   **Unique filename generation:**  Timestamps and random numbers are incorporated to prevent filename conflicts.
*   **File size warning:** A warning is logged for files larger than 100MB.
*   **Enhanced error handling:** More specific error messages are included during file movement and creation.
*   **Verification of file creation:** The function explicitly checks if the file was created after the `mv` operation.
*   **Logging of upload progress and total size:**  The function now logs the total number of files uploaded and the total size of the uploaded files.

The second update to `ImageUploader.js` is functionally identical to the third, and therefore represents a duplicate entry.  There is no meaningful change between them.  The updates to both files show a focus on improving error handling, logging, and overall robustness of the application.
