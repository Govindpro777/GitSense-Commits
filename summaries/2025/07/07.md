# Activity Summary for 7/7/2025

## 12:23:12 AM
The log shows two consecutive commits to `CoursePageStudent.jsx` at 11:50:06 PM and 11:51:03 PM on July 6th, 2025.  Both commits contain identical commented-out code representing a React component for displaying course details to students.  The code displays course information like name, description, price, mode (online/offline), and instructor details. It also includes components for displaying course statistics and handling payment and assignment redirection.  There are no functional differences between the two commits based solely on the provided code snippets.  The repetition suggests either an accidental duplicate commit or a temporary commenting out of the code for debugging or refactoring, followed by another commit which did not change the code.


## 12:23:14 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`.  Both files are React components involved in displaying and editing email content, specifically focusing on email previews within a campaign context.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent several updates between 12:11:04 AM and 12:16:05 AM,  primarily involving commented-out code.  The commented code suggests an initial implementation with features like loading states, fetching campaign data via a `userService`, and managing email content editing. The final version of the file seems to handle email previews, allowing users to view, and potentially edit, email content associated with a campaign.

`EmailContent.jsx` was modified extensively between 12:11:18 AM and 12:20:55 AM.  The main function, `formatEmailContent`, renders email content as JSX, handling various formatting elements like bold text (`**`), bullet points (`-`), italics (`*`), and tables (`|`). A significant change introduced the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`  to handle HTML within table cells. This addresses the issue of preserving line breaks (`\n`) in the description column of tables, improving the rendering.  The addition of `generateEmailHtmlString` at the end suggests a refactoring to separate the HTML generation logic.  The changes reflect an iterative process of improving the rendering and handling of rich text within the email preview, with a focus on correctly displaying tables and handling line breaks.  The `isEditing` prop controls the display of an "Editable Section" tag.  The final updates at 12:19:02 AM and 12:20:55 AM primarily focus on exporting the  `generateEmailHtmlString` function.  This function renders the email content to a static HTML string using `renderToStaticMarkup`.
