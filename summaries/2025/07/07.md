# Activity Summary for 7/7/2025

## 12:23:12 AM
The log shows two consecutive commits to `CoursePageStudent.jsx` at 11:50:06 PM and 11:51:03 PM on July 6th, 2025.  Both commits contain identical commented-out code representing a React component for displaying course details to students.  The code displays course information like name, description, price, mode (online/offline), and instructor details. It also includes components for displaying course statistics and handling payment and assignment redirection.  There are no functional differences between the two commits based solely on the provided code snippets.  The repetition suggests either an accidental duplicate commit or a temporary commenting out of the code for debugging or refactoring, followed by another commit which did not change the code.


## 12:23:14 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`.  Both files are React components involved in displaying and editing email content, specifically focusing on email previews within a campaign context.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent several updates between 12:11:04 AM and 12:16:05 AM,  primarily involving commented-out code.  The commented code suggests an initial implementation with features like loading states, fetching campaign data via a `userService`, and managing email content editing. The final version of the file seems to handle email previews, allowing users to view, and potentially edit, email content associated with a campaign.

`EmailContent.jsx` was modified extensively between 12:11:18 AM and 12:20:55 AM.  The main function, `formatEmailContent`, renders email content as JSX, handling various formatting elements like bold text (`**`), bullet points (`-`), italics (`*`), and tables (`|`). A significant change introduced the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`  to handle HTML within table cells. This addresses the issue of preserving line breaks (`\n`) in the description column of tables, improving the rendering.  The addition of `generateEmailHtmlString` at the end suggests a refactoring to separate the HTML generation logic.  The changes reflect an iterative process of improving the rendering and handling of rich text within the email preview, with a focus on correctly displaying tables and handling line breaks.  The `isEditing` prop controls the display of an "Editable Section" tag.  The final updates at 12:19:02 AM and 12:20:55 AM primarily focus on exporting the  `generateEmailHtmlString` function.  This function renders the email content to a static HTML string using `renderToStaticMarkup`.


## 3:45:07 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the email preview and content rendering.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent several modifications between 12:23:35 AM and 12:43:09 AM on July 7th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: fetching draft data using `userService.get`, generating an email template based on fetched deliverables and campaign brief,  and providing an editable preview. The most significant changes involved refining the display of attachments within the email preview.  Initially, the attachment display was rudimentary. Later versions improved this by adding a close button for individual attachments and correctly displaying PDF previews using a conditional image source (`item.vchattachmentid ?.toLowerCase() .endsWith(".pdf") ? pdf.src : item.attachmentUrl`).  There were also minor revisions to the `generateDeliverableTable` function;  the way the `content` array was joined changed from using `,` to `<br/>` to improve the formatting of the table's description column.


`EmailContent.jsx` was updated at 12:23:47 AM and again at 12:26:45 AM and 12:42:20 AM on July 7th, 2025. The main change involved enhancing the `formatEmailContent` function. This function now renders Markdown-like formatting (bold, italics, bullet points) within the email preview. A notable improvement was the addition of a table rendering capability.  The code parses tables from the input `content` string, represented by pipe-separated values (`|`), and renders them as properly formatted HTML tables. The use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`  is noteworthy in the latest revisions, directly rendering the cell content as HTML, allowing for `<br/>` tags to create line breaks within table cells.  This final version adds a `verticalAlign: "top"` style to ensure correct alignment within the cells.


## 10:20:44 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `BlogDetails.jsx` and `blogData.jsx`.  Both files were modified between 10:13 AM and 10:16 AM on July 7th, 2025.

`blogData.jsx` underwent two revisions (at 10:13:42 AM and 10:14:08 AM) and appears to contain data for a blog, including titles, authors, dates, content summaries ("excerpts"), and related posts.  The data structure suggests the blog post includes various sections like an introduction, paragraphs, lists, a final word, and a "last line."   The changes in these revisions seem minor, likely adjustments to the data itself rather than restructuring.


`BlogDetails.jsx` shows significant changes across four revisions (10:13:21 AM, 10:14:14 AM, 10:16:22 AM, and 10:16:46 AM).  The initial revision shows a component rendering blog details using data from `blogData.jsx`. Subsequent revisions involved iterative improvements and refinements.  Changes include:

* **Image Handling:**  An improvement was made to handle the display of blog images more robustly, using a fallback mechanism (`displayImage`) to ensure an image is shown even if one of the expected fields is missing. This occurred between the first and second revisions.
* **Conditional Rendering:** The structure of the blog post content rendering is adjusted to handle different blog types ("Case-Study", "PR-Tips", etc.) using conditional rendering. This major structural update happened between the second and third revisions.  The code is designed to render different sections for different blog post types based on the `type` field in the data.  
* **Additional Field:** A new field, `"example"`, seems to have been added to the `listItems` within the content of the `BlogDetails.jsx` component. This small addition occurred in the final revision.

The overall pattern in the `BlogDetails.jsx` changes suggests an iterative development process, adding features like conditional rendering and image fallback to enhance the component's robustness and flexibility. The final version supports multiple types of blog posts, each with unique structural needs.


## 11:20:50 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `BlogDetails.jsx` and `blogData.jsx`.  The changes span from 10:32 AM to 11:05 AM on July 7, 2025.

`BlogDetails.jsx` underwent several revisions primarily focused on improving the display of blog post content and handling image fallbacks.  Early revisions involved minor formatting adjustments. A key change (around 10:56 AM) introduced conditional rendering based on the `post.type` property, allowing for different layouts for "Case-Study" posts versus other blog post types ("PR-Tips").  This conditional rendering significantly alters the structure to display unique sections like "Challenge," "Advantage," "Turning Point," "Outcome," and "Result," specific to case studies.  The final revision at 11:05 AM added handling for a `paragraph3` within the content, although it seems there may be an error as it uses `post.content.paragraph2` instead of `post.content.paragraph3`.  Also, the code was simplified by removing some commented-out code.  Image handling was improved with the introduction of  `displayImage` which defaults to `post.featuredImage` if `post.image` is missing.

`blogData.jsx` was updated multiple times between 10:39 AM and 11:05 AM. These revisions appear to be additions or edits to the `blogPosts` array.  The changes seem to involve adding more detail or refining the existing blog post data (possibly adding more blog posts), but the core structure of the data remained the same across all revisions.  There's no clear pattern in these edits beyond data augmentation.
