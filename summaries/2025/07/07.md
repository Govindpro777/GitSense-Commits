# Activity Summary for 7/7/2025

## 12:23:12 AM
The log shows two consecutive commits to `CoursePageStudent.jsx` at 11:50:06 PM and 11:51:03 PM on July 6th, 2025.  Both commits contain identical commented-out code representing a React component for displaying course details to students.  The code displays course information like name, description, price, mode (online/offline), and instructor details. It also includes components for displaying course statistics and handling payment and assignment redirection.  There are no functional differences between the two commits based solely on the provided code snippets.  The repetition suggests either an accidental duplicate commit or a temporary commenting out of the code for debugging or refactoring, followed by another commit which did not change the code.
