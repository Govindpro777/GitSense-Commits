# Activity Summary for 7/3/2025

## 10:14:55 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `index2.html` over July 2nd and 3rd, 2025, primarily focused on refining the layout and styling of a weekly newsletter.  Changes were made iteratively, with minor adjustments to font sizes, margins, padding, and text color across various sections (Greeting, Blog of the Week, Newsletter Feature Box, PR Blunders, Did You Know, Upgrade).  The most significant changes were made between 5:52 PM and 10:57 PM on July 2nd, involving the header section's alignment (shifting from center to left),  and the positioning of the "Weekly" heading in the header using absolute positioning.  Later edits, starting around 12:13 AM on July 3rd, focused on further refinements in padding and column widths to improve the newsletter's visual appeal.  The consistent use of inline styles and table-based layouts is a recurring element throughout the code. A separate file, `index.html`,  was also edited once at 10:01:18 AM on July 3rd, creating a newsletter with a different design and font using Typekit and Google Fonts.  The content of this newsletter however, is largely different, suggesting different design and content iterations for different months.


## 11:14:47 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `index2.html`, a weekly newsletter HTML file, between 10:17 AM and 10:22 AM on July 3, 2025.  The main changes revolve around the newsletter's header section and the right-hand column.

Initially (10:17 AM), the header's "Weekly Newsletter" title was structured within nested tables.  A subsequent revision (10:18 AM) moved this title to a more simplified structure, placing "Weekly" and "Newsletter" as separate h2 and h1 elements respectively, improving readability and layout.  A further refinement (10:19 AM and 10:22 AM)  involved removing "Helvetica Neue" from the font families specified for h1 and h2 elements, simplifying the font declaration to just 'Poppins' and 'Arial'.  These changes to the header suggest an iterative process of design optimization.

The right-hand column, introduced around 10:18 AM, contains a list of journalists to pitch to. This section was added in the second revision and appears to be a consistent element in later revisions, with only minor updates to the list of journalists across those changes. The repeated use of horizontal lines (`<div>` elements with a black or dark grey background) is a consistent styling choice throughout the file, used for visual separation of sections.  The overall style of the newsletter consistently uses a dark blue (#002B5B) color scheme with  'Poppins' and 'League Spartan' fonts.
