# Activity Summary for 7/3/2025

## 10:14:55 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `index2.html` over July 2nd and 3rd, 2025, primarily focused on refining the layout and styling of a weekly newsletter.  Changes were made iteratively, with minor adjustments to font sizes, margins, padding, and text color across various sections (Greeting, Blog of the Week, Newsletter Feature Box, PR Blunders, Did You Know, Upgrade).  The most significant changes were made between 5:52 PM and 10:57 PM on July 2nd, involving the header section's alignment (shifting from center to left),  and the positioning of the "Weekly" heading in the header using absolute positioning.  Later edits, starting around 12:13 AM on July 3rd, focused on further refinements in padding and column widths to improve the newsletter's visual appeal.  The consistent use of inline styles and table-based layouts is a recurring element throughout the code. A separate file, `index.html`,  was also edited once at 10:01:18 AM on July 3rd, creating a newsletter with a different design and font using Typekit and Google Fonts.  The content of this newsletter however, is largely different, suggesting different design and content iterations for different months.
