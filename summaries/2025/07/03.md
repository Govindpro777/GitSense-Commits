# Activity Summary for 7/3/2025

## 10:14:55 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `index2.html` over July 2nd and 3rd, 2025, primarily focused on refining the layout and styling of a weekly newsletter.  Changes were made iteratively, with minor adjustments to font sizes, margins, padding, and text color across various sections (Greeting, Blog of the Week, Newsletter Feature Box, PR Blunders, Did You Know, Upgrade).  The most significant changes were made between 5:52 PM and 10:57 PM on July 2nd, involving the header section's alignment (shifting from center to left),  and the positioning of the "Weekly" heading in the header using absolute positioning.  Later edits, starting around 12:13 AM on July 3rd, focused on further refinements in padding and column widths to improve the newsletter's visual appeal.  The consistent use of inline styles and table-based layouts is a recurring element throughout the code. A separate file, `index.html`,  was also edited once at 10:01:18 AM on July 3rd, creating a newsletter with a different design and font using Typekit and Google Fonts.  The content of this newsletter however, is largely different, suggesting different design and content iterations for different months.


## 11:14:47 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `index2.html`, a weekly newsletter HTML file, between 10:17 AM and 10:22 AM on July 3, 2025.  The main changes revolve around the newsletter's header section and the right-hand column.

Initially (10:17 AM), the header's "Weekly Newsletter" title was structured within nested tables.  A subsequent revision (10:18 AM) moved this title to a more simplified structure, placing "Weekly" and "Newsletter" as separate h2 and h1 elements respectively, improving readability and layout.  A further refinement (10:19 AM and 10:22 AM)  involved removing "Helvetica Neue" from the font families specified for h1 and h2 elements, simplifying the font declaration to just 'Poppins' and 'Arial'.  These changes to the header suggest an iterative process of design optimization.

The right-hand column, introduced around 10:18 AM, contains a list of journalists to pitch to. This section was added in the second revision and appears to be a consistent element in later revisions, with only minor updates to the list of journalists across those changes. The repeated use of horizontal lines (`<div>` elements with a black or dark grey background) is a consistent styling choice throughout the file, used for visual separation of sections.  The overall style of the newsletter consistently uses a dark blue (#002B5B) color scheme with  'Poppins' and 'League Spartan' fonts.


## 12:14:51 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `index2.html` on July 3rd, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be modifying the header image and size.  Initially, the header included text elements ("Weekly Newsletter"), which were subsequently removed, and a smaller header image was replaced with a larger one (`removebg-preview.png`) progressively increasing its width from 80 to 250 pixels across several commits between 11:48 AM and 12:13 PM. The  `width` attribute of the image in the header was the primary change across these commits.  There is a consistent use of inline CSS styling throughout the HTML, creating a visually rich email newsletter layout.  The content itself remains largely unchanged, focusing on PR and communications news and services offered by Skribe.  No significant changes were observed outside these header image modifications.


## 1:14:49 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `index2.html`, an HTML file for a weekly newsletter,  between 12:15 PM and 12:17 PM on July 3rd, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the right-hand column of the newsletter layout.

The initial version (12:15:02 PM) contained a partially completed right column listing "Top 5 Journalists to Pitch Right Now," but the list of journalists was incomplete.

Subsequent edits (12:15:33 PM and 12:15:40 PM)  completed the list of journalists in the right-hand column, adding names and their affiliated publications.  The content of the rest of the HTML remained consistent across these revisions, suggesting the focus was solely on adding the journalist list.

The final revision (12:17:50 PM) shows no further changes to the code compared to the previous versions. The HTML structure remains consistent across all versions, using nested tables for layout and incorporating various styles for font, color, and spacing.  The consistent use of inline styles is a notable pattern.


## 2:14:50 PM
The log shows two revisions of `index2.html`, both on July 3rd, 2025.  The first revision (1:26:03 PM) is a complete HTML structure for a weekly newsletter,  featuring sections for greetings, a blog highlight, a newsletter recommendations section, PR blunder advice, a "Did You Know" section, an upgrade call-to-action, and social media links.  The styling uses Google Fonts ('Poppins' and 'League Spartan') and incorporates a two-column layout.  The second revision (1:28:01 PM) appears to be identical to the first.  No substantive changes are visible between the two commits.  The newsletter heavily utilizes nested tables for layout and contains numerous inline styles.  The content focuses on promoting Skribe, a media intelligence platform.


## 2:58:38 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts` was updated on 7/3/2025, 2:13:43 PM.  The update focuses on enhancing the `axios` instance used for API calls.  Key changes include:

* **Base URL Handling:** The code now uses a function `getBaseURL()` from the `../config` module to dynamically determine the base URL, offering flexibility across different environments (development, beta, production).  Previously, multiple hardcoded base URLs were present.

* **Improved Error Handling:** The `interceptors.response` section has been significantly improved to handle 401 (Unauthorized) errors more robustly. It implements a token refresh mechanism: If a request fails due to an expired access token, it attempts to refresh the token using `/Authenticate/refresh-token` endpoint.  If the refresh fails, the user is redirected to the login page (`/`).  Network errors are also handled with an alert.

* **Concurrency Control:** The code prevents multiple simultaneous token refresh attempts using `isRefreshing` and `refreshAccessTokenPromise`, ensuring that only one refresh process occurs at a time.

* **Alert Handling:**  The code now utilizes an `Alert` component (presumably a custom component) for displaying success and error messages, replacing simpler `alert` calls.  Specifically, network errors now trigger a toast message.


The changes demonstrate a clear improvement in the application's error handling and resilience, especially concerning authentication.  The use of a dynamic base URL improves maintainability and deployment flexibility.


## 3:14:53 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `index2.html`, a weekly newsletter HTML template,  made on July 3rd, 2025.  The main changes revolve around the overall width of the newsletter layout.

Between 2:39:31 PM and 2:39:44 PM, the `style="max-width: 700px"` attribute within the main table was altered to `style="max-width: 800px"`, increasing the newsletter's maximum width. This was reverted back to `style="max-width: 700px"` in the final revision at 2:40:09 PM.  No other content changes are apparent across the three revisions.  The code consistently uses nested tables to structure the layout, incorporating images, text, and links.  The styling is consistent throughout, applying specific font families, colors (#002B5B, #374151, etc.), and sizes to various HTML elements.  The newsletter features sections such as a header with a logo, blog highlights, featured newsletters, PR blunder discussions, a "Did You Know" section, an upgrade call-to-action, and social media links.
