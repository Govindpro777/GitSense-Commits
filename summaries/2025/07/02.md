# Activity Summary for 7/2/2025

## 10:32:03 AM
The log shows updates to two React components: `Discover.jsx` and `TrendingJournalists.jsx`.

`Discover.jsx` (7/2/2025, 9:35:23 AM): This component, used for discovering influencers, underwent significant changes.  It fetches data using `userService` and various API endpoints (`GET_CATEGORY_OPTIONS`, `GET_CITY_OPTIONS`, `GET_LANGUAGE_OPTIONS`, `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA`, etc.). The component handles filtering based on numerous criteria (categories, locations, languages, gender, follower count, engagement rates).  It also includes state management for search terms, pagination (`nextPageToken`), selected influencers, and loading states.  The `advanceFilterOptions` constant was modified, changing some label names. The component interacts with local storage to manage shortlisted creators and updates a draft URL using `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`.


`TrendingJournalists.jsx` (7/2/2025, 10:21:18 AM, 10:21:26 AM, 10:22:29 AM):  This component displays a list of trending journalists.  It fetches data from the `TRENDINGJOURNALISTS` endpoint using `userService.get()`.  The component renders a loading state using `react-loading-skeleton` and displays journalist information, including name, outlets, city, and status (`intShutShop`).  There were multiple minor updates to this component within a short time frame.  The most significant change between the first and last entries involved the display of the journalist's city.  Initially, it handled potential arrays of city names, later updates simplified this to display a single city name using `capitalizeFirstLetter`.


## 12:46:52 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `index.html` between 12:24 PM and 12:40 PM on July 2nd, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the header section and minor stylistic adjustments.

Initially, the header used a linear gradient background and a logo with inverted colors.  Around 12:29 PM, this was replaced with a background image (`https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/mailerHeader.png`).  A subsequent edit at 12:29:55 PM removed unnecessary padding styling from the header's background.

Between 12:37 PM and 12:39 PM, several edits focused on the color of the feature box, ultimately settling on `#0A4C86`.

Finally,  the newsletter title's alignment in the header was changed from right to center alignment around 12:39 PM. A further minor change at 12:40 PM added a top margin to the newsletter title within the header.  The content of the newsletter itself remained consistent throughout all revisions.


## 1:46:52 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `index.html` between 1:01 PM and 1:07 PM on July 2nd, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be styling the newsletter's header.

Specifically, the `h1` element containing "JUNE 2025 NEWSLETTER" underwent several modifications:

* **Font size:**  The font size was adjusted multiple times, settling on `40px`.
* **Font family:** The font family was changed from `"Inter", sans-serif` to `'Proxima Nova', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`, and then simplified to just `'Proxima Nova'`, before reverting back to the longer list.
* **Color:** The header color changed from `#1e3a8a` to `#002B5B`.

There were also minor changes, including extra spacing adjustments around the `h4` tags within the feature boxes, that are not reflected in the final revision.  The content of the newsletter itself remained consistent throughout the revisions.  The frequent changes to the header suggest iterative design adjustments were being made.  The final revision at 1:07 PM appears to represent the completed styling for the header.


## 2:47:06 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `index.html` on July 2nd, 2025, between 1:52 PM and 2:42 PM.  The changes primarily involve stylistic adjustments and minor content updates within the HTML structure of a newsletter.  There's a consistent use of tables for layout, indicating a focus on email-friendly design.

Initially, the code defines fonts using Google Fonts and inline styles for a newsletter.  Subsequent changes focused on:


* **Font Changes (2:39 PM):**  A significant change at 2:39 PM altered the font selection, switching from Google Fonts to Adobe Fonts ('proxima-nova') with Montserrat as a fallback. This update involved more comprehensively applying the selected font family across different HTML elements (h1-h6, p, td, th, div, span, a).  The change suggests a move towards a potentially more professionally designed or licensed font.

* **Padding Adjustments (2:27 PM and onward):**  Several revisions adjusted padding values, particularly in the main content section, eventually settling on `padding: 35px 35px` then `padding: 48px`. This fine-tuning indicates iterative improvements to the visual spacing of the newsletter content.

* **Minor Textual Alterations:** Small changes to text formatting, including font sizes (e.g., reducing some paragraph text sizes from 16px to 14px), text decoration, and the addition of a `span` element for bolding within the "Your Go-To Resources" section.  These changes improved visual presentation.

* **Hyperlink Updates (2:22 PM onwards):** The hyperlink for "Try it now" was initially a placeholder (`href="#" `) and later changed to point to `https://app.goskribe.com/`. A similar pattern was seen with the "Your Go-To Resources" section, which initially had a placeholder and then changed to a Google Docs link (`https://docs.google.com/document/d/....`). This change reflects the incorporation of functional links.

* **Structural Change (2:06 PM onward):**  The structure of the "Key Appointments & Industry Updates" section was modified, moving from within the two-column table to a separate table below it.



The overall pattern shows a gradual refinement of the newsletter's visual appeal and the addition of functional links, indicating a process of iterative design and finalization. The repeated updates within a short timeframe suggest an ongoing refinement process rather than major rewrites.


## 3:46:52 PM
The log shows iterative changes to two HTML files, `index.html` and `index2.html`, representing email newsletters.  The majority of changes in `index.html` (between 2:52 PM and 3:09 PM) focus on styling and minor content adjustments, primarily padding and alignment within the newsletter's table-based layout.  There's a consistent use of inline styles throughout the HTML.  A notable change at 2:53 PM adds social media icons (Instagram, X, LinkedIn) to the footer.  Later, around 3:05 PM, a call to action link ("try it now") is updated to include a specific path (`https://app.goskribe.com/pressrelease`).  The final modification at 3:09 PM refactors the call to action into an `<a>` tag, improving accessibility.

`index2.html`, created at 3:42 PM, introduces a new weekly newsletter design. This version uses a two-column layout, different styling (background color, font sizes, and section headers), and content focused on a "blog of the week," "PR blunders," and lists of top journalists and publications.  The overall style is cleaner and more concise compared to the `index.html` file.  This suggests the creation of a separate, potentially more modern-looking newsletter format.
