# Activity Summary for 7/2/2025

## 10:32:03 AM
The log shows updates to two React components: `Discover.jsx` and `TrendingJournalists.jsx`.

`Discover.jsx` (7/2/2025, 9:35:23 AM): This component, used for discovering influencers, underwent significant changes.  It fetches data using `userService` and various API endpoints (`GET_CATEGORY_OPTIONS`, `GET_CITY_OPTIONS`, `GET_LANGUAGE_OPTIONS`, `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA`, etc.). The component handles filtering based on numerous criteria (categories, locations, languages, gender, follower count, engagement rates).  It also includes state management for search terms, pagination (`nextPageToken`), selected influencers, and loading states.  The `advanceFilterOptions` constant was modified, changing some label names. The component interacts with local storage to manage shortlisted creators and updates a draft URL using `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`.


`TrendingJournalists.jsx` (7/2/2025, 10:21:18 AM, 10:21:26 AM, 10:22:29 AM):  This component displays a list of trending journalists.  It fetches data from the `TRENDINGJOURNALISTS` endpoint using `userService.get()`.  The component renders a loading state using `react-loading-skeleton` and displays journalist information, including name, outlets, city, and status (`intShutShop`).  There were multiple minor updates to this component within a short time frame.  The most significant change between the first and last entries involved the display of the journalist's city.  Initially, it handled potential arrays of city names, later updates simplified this to display a single city name using `capitalizeFirstLetter`.


## 12:46:52 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `index.html` between 12:24 PM and 12:40 PM on July 2nd, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the header section and minor stylistic adjustments.

Initially, the header used a linear gradient background and a logo with inverted colors.  Around 12:29 PM, this was replaced with a background image (`https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/mailerHeader.png`).  A subsequent edit at 12:29:55 PM removed unnecessary padding styling from the header's background.

Between 12:37 PM and 12:39 PM, several edits focused on the color of the feature box, ultimately settling on `#0A4C86`.

Finally,  the newsletter title's alignment in the header was changed from right to center alignment around 12:39 PM. A further minor change at 12:40 PM added a top margin to the newsletter title within the header.  The content of the newsletter itself remained consistent throughout all revisions.
