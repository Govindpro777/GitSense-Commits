# Activity Summary for 7/2/2025

## 10:32:03 AM
The log shows updates to two React components: `Discover.jsx` and `TrendingJournalists.jsx`.

`Discover.jsx` (7/2/2025, 9:35:23 AM): This component, used for discovering influencers, underwent significant changes.  It fetches data using `userService` and various API endpoints (`GET_CATEGORY_OPTIONS`, `GET_CITY_OPTIONS`, `GET_LANGUAGE_OPTIONS`, `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA`, etc.). The component handles filtering based on numerous criteria (categories, locations, languages, gender, follower count, engagement rates).  It also includes state management for search terms, pagination (`nextPageToken`), selected influencers, and loading states.  The `advanceFilterOptions` constant was modified, changing some label names. The component interacts with local storage to manage shortlisted creators and updates a draft URL using `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`.


`TrendingJournalists.jsx` (7/2/2025, 10:21:18 AM, 10:21:26 AM, 10:22:29 AM):  This component displays a list of trending journalists.  It fetches data from the `TRENDINGJOURNALISTS` endpoint using `userService.get()`.  The component renders a loading state using `react-loading-skeleton` and displays journalist information, including name, outlets, city, and status (`intShutShop`).  There were multiple minor updates to this component within a short time frame.  The most significant change between the first and last entries involved the display of the journalist's city.  Initially, it handled potential arrays of city names, later updates simplified this to display a single city name using `capitalizeFirstLetter`.
