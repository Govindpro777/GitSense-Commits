# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 12:10:19 AM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `EditBiographicalInfo.jsx` and `EditBasicInfo.jsx`, both part of a teacher management system within a larger LMS dashboard application.

`EditBiographicalInfo.jsx` underwent several revisions between July 9th and 10th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be around improving the user interface and handling of file uploads (photo, resume, intro video).  Specifically, the updates include improved error handling for file types, addition of preview functionality for uploaded images,  and clearer display of uploaded resume and video file names.  The "Teaching Mode" and "Branch" selection elements were also modified; the `select` elements for both were disabled and styled with a grey background to indicate they are not editable (`cursor-not-allowed` was added).  These changes happened in a series of small commits between 11:57 PM on July 9th and 12:02 AM on July 10th.

`EditBasicInfo.jsx` was modified twice on July 10th, 2025, around 12:00 AM. These minor changes involved refinements to the styling of input fields, specifically adding a grey background and disabling cursor interaction for the email field (`name === "email"`).  The changes involved adding a conditional class to the input element to apply the style only when the input's name is 'email'. This ensures that the email remains read-only.  There were no functional changes, only style improvements.


## 1:18:48 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `Choose.jsx` component, primarily focusing on styling and layout adjustments.  Initial versions (10:08 AM and 10:09 AM) displayed product cards for "Skribe" and "Socion" with placeholder text and images.  A significant restructuring occurred around 10:19 AM, transitioning from a gray background to white, changing card dimensions and styles, and simplifying the header.  Subsequent changes between 10:19 AM and 10:31 AM involved iterative refinements to the styling: adjusting text sizes, colors (especially moving towards black text on white background), adding separators, and fine-tuning the card dimensions and border-radius. The gap between card components was also adjusted multiple times during this period.

By 10:55 AM,  arrow icons were added to the buttons. The final modifications between 10:55 AM and 11:16 AM involved further layout adjustments,  introducing a vertical divider between the cards for larger screens and making minor text adjustments.  The component's name changed from `JangaMediaComponent` to `ChoosePage`.


The `Insights.jsx` component underwent a major overhaul starting at 11:38 AM and continuing until 12:55 PM.  Early versions showed tables for "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers" with placeholder data.  Between 11:53 AM and 12:55 PM the component changed significantly.  The older versions used `lucide-react` icons, which were removed later.  The component was completely rewritten, transitioning from simple tables to more sophisticated tables with better styling,  replacing placeholder data with more realistic sample data, and incorporating functionality for adding deliverables.  The component's name was changed from `InfluencerCampaignDashboard` to `SparksChocolateCampaign` and finally `InfluencerCampaignDashboard` again.  The styling was heavily modified to use Tailwind CSS classes for greater control and consistency. The most significant changes were introducing a responsive design and improved data representation through the use of more styled table components with additional features.  The final version features gradient backgrounds and improved responsiveness.  The code also shows a shift from using inline styles to using className attributes for styling.
Finally, the `SocialLandingPage.jsx` component was updated at 11:39 AM to include the newly modified `Insights` component.


## 2:14:16 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple files within the `Skribe-Frontend` project on July 10th, 2025.  The most significant changes relate to the implementation of a blog section.

**`Navbar.jsx`:** This component underwent multiple revisions throughout the afternoon.  The changes primarily involved refinements to the navigation bar's responsiveness and styling, particularly for dropdown menus under "Products" and "Resources". A link to "/blog" was added to the "Resources" section, replacing the previous link to "/skribe365".  These modifications occurred between 1:25 PM and 1:44 PM.


**`Blog.jsx`:** This file, representing the main blog page, went through several iterations. Initially, it included a `Navbar`, `Hero`, and `Footer` component, these components were then commented out, and the file contained only "Hello". Later, the components were re-added, and the "Hello" was removed.  The final version at 1:57 PM contains the Navbar, Hero, and Footer, indicating the blog section is being completed. This series of changes happened between 1:40 PM and 1:57 PM.

**`AppRoutes.js`:** This routing file shows addition of routes for various components in the application and changes happened between 1:43 PM and 2:05 PM. The primary change is  the addition of a route for a new `BlogDetails` component, which suggests a dynamic blog post display capability.

**`Hero.jsx`:** This component was responsible for rendering the blog's hero section and its related functionality. The final version at 2:07 PM  uses `react-router-dom`'s `Link` component to handle navigation, changing from using `next/link`. Before that, it contained a fully functional blog display component that included search functionality and blog post listing based on categories and search terms and changes occurred around 1:48 PM and 2:07 PM.  


**`blogData.jsx`:** This file contains sample data for blog posts.  It underwent changes to reflect the newly implemented blog sections which were added  around 1:49 PM and 1:53 PM.


**`BlogDetails.jsx`:** This component, for detailed blog posts, was added to the project.  The initial version used `next/link` for linking.  Changes at 2:11 PM to correctly utilize `react-router-dom`'s `useParams` hook to fetch the blog post slug from the URL for dynamic blog details.


In summary, the log documents the development of a blog section for the Skribe-Frontend application. This involved creating components for the main blog page (`Blog.jsx`), individual blog posts (`BlogDetails.jsx`), and a hero section (`Hero.jsx`), and updating routing (`AppRoutes.js`), alongside numerous smaller style and functionality adjustments to the `Navbar.jsx` and data updates to the `blogData.jsx`. The entire process appears to have taken approximately one and a half hours.


## 3:14:11 PM
The log shows multiple updates to React components for a blog section within a frontend application.  The most significant changes occurred between 2:31 PM and 2:36 PM on July 10, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `BlogDetails.jsx` and `Hero.jsx` files.

**`blogData.jsx` (7/10/2025, 2:16:56 PM):** This file contains data for blog posts, including their content, metadata (title, author, date, etc.), and related posts. The data is structured as an array of objects, each representing a blog post with nested objects for content and related posts.  Two blog posts are defined: "7 Newsletters Every PR & Comms Pro Should Subscribe To" and "7 Press Release Types Every Brand Should Master (with Examples)". The data structure is complex and includes extensive information for each blog post.

**`Hero.jsx` (Multiple Updates):** This component renders the hero section of the blog page. The initial version (2:30:13 PM) displays a featured blog post, allows filtering by category ("All", "PR-Tips By Skribe", "Skribe Insights", "Success Stories"), and includes a search functionality.  Subsequent updates (2:32:52 PM, 2:33:28 PM, 2:33:40 PM, 2:33:57 PM) consistently  replace the `window.location.href` method for navigation with `react-router-dom`'s `navigate` function for improved internal routing.


**`BlogDetails.jsx` (Multiple Updates):** This component displays individual blog posts.  The initial version (2:31:49 PM) renders blog post content based on the URL parameter (`slug`). It also includes a Twitter link and displays related blog posts. The crucial change between 2:31:49 PM and 2:36:35 PM involves the replacement of  `window.location.href` with the `navigate` function from `react-router-dom` for handling navigation to related blog posts. The component handles different blog post types ("Case-Study" and others) differently, rendering content accordingly. The code is highly structured and well-organized, using conditional rendering to adapt to different blog post types.


## 3:39:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Insights.jsx` component between 3:07 PM and 3:18 PM on July 10, 2025.  The component displays data in two tables: "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers".  Both tables consistently display information for the influencer "Bhuvan Bam"  (@bhuvan.bam22) throughout all revisions.

The initial revisions (3:07 PM - 3:08 PM) focused on adding a "Remove" column to the "Shortlisted Influencers" table, reflecting in changes to the `tableHeadings` array.  A minor visual styling change was made to the status indicator in the "Shortlisted Influencers" table (color changes around 3:08 PM).

Between 3:13 PM and 3:18 PM,  further modifications were made. The styling of some cells in the "Shortlisted Influencers" table was changed to a darker shade of gray (`text-[#00000080]`).  Around 3:15 PM, the layout of the "Name" and "Username" columns in the "Shortlisted Influencers" table were altered, consolidating both into a single column before reverting to two separate columns in a later revision.  Finally, the "Username" column in the "Engaged Influencers" table was removed  around 3:16 PM and then restored around 3:17 PM.  The final version at 3:18 PM appears to be a minor change from the previous revision and similar to the version at 3:16PM, with the "Username" column remaining.  The overall structure and data displayed in the component remained largely consistent throughout the revision process.


## 5:14:19 PM
The log shows multiple updates to blog-related components (`blogData.jsx` and `BlogDetails.jsx`) within a React frontend application, between 3:57 PM and 4:03 PM on July 10, 2025.  `blogData.jsx`, containing blog post data, was modified three times within this period.  These changes appear to be minor adjustments and additions to the blog post data, possibly refining content or adding an image to one of the related posts.  Specifically, the third update to `blogData.jsx` (4:03:12 PM) added an image path  `/assets/article-banner.png` to the related post with the slug "bandhan-amc-skribe-case-study."


`BlogDetails.jsx`, responsible for rendering individual blog posts, was also updated twice during this timeframe. The first update (3:57:29 PM) involved extensive code, suggesting a substantial initial implementation or a major restructuring. The second update (4:00:36 PM) included no visible changes. The final update (4:01:15 PM) modified the font size of the blog title (h1 element), reducing it from sizes 30px, 35px, and 40px to 24px, 28px, and 30px, respectively, across different screen sizes.  There are no other apparent changes in the code between those updates of BlogDetails.jsx.  The changes to both files suggest iterative development and refinement of the blog section of the application.


## 5:42:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Insights.jsx`, a React component likely displaying influencer campaign data.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout—displaying tables of "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers"—but the presentation and features evolve over time.

The initial commits (4:29 PM - 4:34 PM) focus on the visual styling of the component, using Tailwind CSS classes for layout, colors, and typography.  These commits show incremental changes in styling and formatting, with no major structural alterations to the component.  The data displayed remains consistent, featuring placeholder data for Bhuvan Bam.  The notable change during this period is the addition of a delete icon in the "Shortlisted Influencers" table around 4:31 PM.

Later commits (4:51 PM - 5:07 PM) refine the styling further and introduce a profile picture (`/assets/bb.svg`) and adjust the display of the influencer's name and username.  Around 5:02 PM, the "Engaged Influencers" table undergoes a significant reduction in size and complexity, removing the "Username" and "Action" columns. The button styling also changes during this phase.


A major change occurs at 5:19 PM, where the entire component is commented out. Then immediately after (5:22 PM onwards) a new version of the component is introduced. This version adds a modal/popup (`isPopupOpen` state) for adding deliverables, triggered by clicking the "Add Deliverables" button.  The popup includes input fields for link, type, duration, and cost of the deliverables. Functionalities like `handleAddDeliverables` and `closePopup` are introduced to manage the popup state.  The styling of the popup and buttons is further refined, with hover effects added around 5:23 PM.  Finally, the opacity of the overlay behind the popup is adjusted in subsequent commits, achieving the final version.

Throughout the entire process, the data used (`engagedInfluencers`, `shortlistedInfluencers`) remains largely static, serving primarily as placeholders for demonstration.  The main focus lies in improving the UI, especially through the addition of the deliverables popup and UI refinement using Tailwind CSS.
