# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 12:10:19 AM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `EditBiographicalInfo.jsx` and `EditBasicInfo.jsx`, both part of a teacher management system within a larger LMS dashboard application.

`EditBiographicalInfo.jsx` underwent several revisions between July 9th and 10th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be around improving the user interface and handling of file uploads (photo, resume, intro video).  Specifically, the updates include improved error handling for file types, addition of preview functionality for uploaded images,  and clearer display of uploaded resume and video file names.  The "Teaching Mode" and "Branch" selection elements were also modified; the `select` elements for both were disabled and styled with a grey background to indicate they are not editable (`cursor-not-allowed` was added).  These changes happened in a series of small commits between 11:57 PM on July 9th and 12:02 AM on July 10th.

`EditBasicInfo.jsx` was modified twice on July 10th, 2025, around 12:00 AM. These minor changes involved refinements to the styling of input fields, specifically adding a grey background and disabling cursor interaction for the email field (`name === "email"`).  The changes involved adding a conditional class to the input element to apply the style only when the input's name is 'email'. This ensures that the email remains read-only.  There were no functional changes, only style improvements.
