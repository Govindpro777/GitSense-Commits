# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 12:10:19 AM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `EditBiographicalInfo.jsx` and `EditBasicInfo.jsx`, both part of a teacher management system within a larger LMS dashboard application.

`EditBiographicalInfo.jsx` underwent several revisions between July 9th and 10th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be around improving the user interface and handling of file uploads (photo, resume, intro video).  Specifically, the updates include improved error handling for file types, addition of preview functionality for uploaded images,  and clearer display of uploaded resume and video file names.  The "Teaching Mode" and "Branch" selection elements were also modified; the `select` elements for both were disabled and styled with a grey background to indicate they are not editable (`cursor-not-allowed` was added).  These changes happened in a series of small commits between 11:57 PM on July 9th and 12:02 AM on July 10th.

`EditBasicInfo.jsx` was modified twice on July 10th, 2025, around 12:00 AM. These minor changes involved refinements to the styling of input fields, specifically adding a grey background and disabling cursor interaction for the email field (`name === "email"`).  The changes involved adding a conditional class to the input element to apply the style only when the input's name is 'email'. This ensures that the email remains read-only.  There were no functional changes, only style improvements.


## 1:18:48 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `Choose.jsx` component, primarily focusing on styling and layout adjustments.  Initial versions (10:08 AM and 10:09 AM) displayed product cards for "Skribe" and "Socion" with placeholder text and images.  A significant restructuring occurred around 10:19 AM, transitioning from a gray background to white, changing card dimensions and styles, and simplifying the header.  Subsequent changes between 10:19 AM and 10:31 AM involved iterative refinements to the styling: adjusting text sizes, colors (especially moving towards black text on white background), adding separators, and fine-tuning the card dimensions and border-radius. The gap between card components was also adjusted multiple times during this period.

By 10:55 AM,  arrow icons were added to the buttons. The final modifications between 10:55 AM and 11:16 AM involved further layout adjustments,  introducing a vertical divider between the cards for larger screens and making minor text adjustments.  The component's name changed from `JangaMediaComponent` to `ChoosePage`.


The `Insights.jsx` component underwent a major overhaul starting at 11:38 AM and continuing until 12:55 PM.  Early versions showed tables for "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers" with placeholder data.  Between 11:53 AM and 12:55 PM the component changed significantly.  The older versions used `lucide-react` icons, which were removed later.  The component was completely rewritten, transitioning from simple tables to more sophisticated tables with better styling,  replacing placeholder data with more realistic sample data, and incorporating functionality for adding deliverables.  The component's name was changed from `InfluencerCampaignDashboard` to `SparksChocolateCampaign` and finally `InfluencerCampaignDashboard` again.  The styling was heavily modified to use Tailwind CSS classes for greater control and consistency. The most significant changes were introducing a responsive design and improved data representation through the use of more styled table components with additional features.  The final version features gradient backgrounds and improved responsiveness.  The code also shows a shift from using inline styles to using className attributes for styling.
Finally, the `SocialLandingPage.jsx` component was updated at 11:39 AM to include the newly modified `Insights` component.
