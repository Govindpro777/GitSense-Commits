# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 12:10:19 AM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `EditBiographicalInfo.jsx` and `EditBasicInfo.jsx`, both part of a teacher management system within a larger LMS dashboard application.

`EditBiographicalInfo.jsx` underwent several revisions between July 9th and 10th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be around improving the user interface and handling of file uploads (photo, resume, intro video).  Specifically, the updates include improved error handling for file types, addition of preview functionality for uploaded images,  and clearer display of uploaded resume and video file names.  The "Teaching Mode" and "Branch" selection elements were also modified; the `select` elements for both were disabled and styled with a grey background to indicate they are not editable (`cursor-not-allowed` was added).  These changes happened in a series of small commits between 11:57 PM on July 9th and 12:02 AM on July 10th.

`EditBasicInfo.jsx` was modified twice on July 10th, 2025, around 12:00 AM. These minor changes involved refinements to the styling of input fields, specifically adding a grey background and disabling cursor interaction for the email field (`name === "email"`).  The changes involved adding a conditional class to the input element to apply the style only when the input's name is 'email'. This ensures that the email remains read-only.  There were no functional changes, only style improvements.


## 1:18:48 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `Choose.jsx` component, primarily focusing on styling and layout adjustments.  Initial versions (10:08 AM and 10:09 AM) displayed product cards for "Skribe" and "Socion" with placeholder text and images.  A significant restructuring occurred around 10:19 AM, transitioning from a gray background to white, changing card dimensions and styles, and simplifying the header.  Subsequent changes between 10:19 AM and 10:31 AM involved iterative refinements to the styling: adjusting text sizes, colors (especially moving towards black text on white background), adding separators, and fine-tuning the card dimensions and border-radius. The gap between card components was also adjusted multiple times during this period.

By 10:55 AM,  arrow icons were added to the buttons. The final modifications between 10:55 AM and 11:16 AM involved further layout adjustments,  introducing a vertical divider between the cards for larger screens and making minor text adjustments.  The component's name changed from `JangaMediaComponent` to `ChoosePage`.


The `Insights.jsx` component underwent a major overhaul starting at 11:38 AM and continuing until 12:55 PM.  Early versions showed tables for "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers" with placeholder data.  Between 11:53 AM and 12:55 PM the component changed significantly.  The older versions used `lucide-react` icons, which were removed later.  The component was completely rewritten, transitioning from simple tables to more sophisticated tables with better styling,  replacing placeholder data with more realistic sample data, and incorporating functionality for adding deliverables.  The component's name was changed from `InfluencerCampaignDashboard` to `SparksChocolateCampaign` and finally `InfluencerCampaignDashboard` again.  The styling was heavily modified to use Tailwind CSS classes for greater control and consistency. The most significant changes were introducing a responsive design and improved data representation through the use of more styled table components with additional features.  The final version features gradient backgrounds and improved responsiveness.  The code also shows a shift from using inline styles to using className attributes for styling.
Finally, the `SocialLandingPage.jsx` component was updated at 11:39 AM to include the newly modified `Insights` component.


## 2:14:16 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple files within the `Skribe-Frontend` project on July 10th, 2025.  The most significant changes relate to the implementation of a blog section.

**`Navbar.jsx`:** This component underwent multiple revisions throughout the afternoon.  The changes primarily involved refinements to the navigation bar's responsiveness and styling, particularly for dropdown menus under "Products" and "Resources". A link to "/blog" was added to the "Resources" section, replacing the previous link to "/skribe365".  These modifications occurred between 1:25 PM and 1:44 PM.


**`Blog.jsx`:** This file, representing the main blog page, went through several iterations. Initially, it included a `Navbar`, `Hero`, and `Footer` component, these components were then commented out, and the file contained only "Hello". Later, the components were re-added, and the "Hello" was removed.  The final version at 1:57 PM contains the Navbar, Hero, and Footer, indicating the blog section is being completed. This series of changes happened between 1:40 PM and 1:57 PM.

**`AppRoutes.js`:** This routing file shows addition of routes for various components in the application and changes happened between 1:43 PM and 2:05 PM. The primary change is  the addition of a route for a new `BlogDetails` component, which suggests a dynamic blog post display capability.

**`Hero.jsx`:** This component was responsible for rendering the blog's hero section and its related functionality. The final version at 2:07 PM  uses `react-router-dom`'s `Link` component to handle navigation, changing from using `next/link`. Before that, it contained a fully functional blog display component that included search functionality and blog post listing based on categories and search terms and changes occurred around 1:48 PM and 2:07 PM.  


**`blogData.jsx`:** This file contains sample data for blog posts.  It underwent changes to reflect the newly implemented blog sections which were added  around 1:49 PM and 1:53 PM.


**`BlogDetails.jsx`:** This component, for detailed blog posts, was added to the project.  The initial version used `next/link` for linking.  Changes at 2:11 PM to correctly utilize `react-router-dom`'s `useParams` hook to fetch the blog post slug from the URL for dynamic blog details.


In summary, the log documents the development of a blog section for the Skribe-Frontend application. This involved creating components for the main blog page (`Blog.jsx`), individual blog posts (`BlogDetails.jsx`), and a hero section (`Hero.jsx`), and updating routing (`AppRoutes.js`), alongside numerous smaller style and functionality adjustments to the `Navbar.jsx` and data updates to the `blogData.jsx`. The entire process appears to have taken approximately one and a half hours.


## 3:14:11 PM
The log shows multiple updates to React components for a blog section within a frontend application.  The most significant changes occurred between 2:31 PM and 2:36 PM on July 10, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `BlogDetails.jsx` and `Hero.jsx` files.

**`blogData.jsx` (7/10/2025, 2:16:56 PM):** This file contains data for blog posts, including their content, metadata (title, author, date, etc.), and related posts. The data is structured as an array of objects, each representing a blog post with nested objects for content and related posts.  Two blog posts are defined: "7 Newsletters Every PR & Comms Pro Should Subscribe To" and "7 Press Release Types Every Brand Should Master (with Examples)". The data structure is complex and includes extensive information for each blog post.

**`Hero.jsx` (Multiple Updates):** This component renders the hero section of the blog page. The initial version (2:30:13 PM) displays a featured blog post, allows filtering by category ("All", "PR-Tips By Skribe", "Skribe Insights", "Success Stories"), and includes a search functionality.  Subsequent updates (2:32:52 PM, 2:33:28 PM, 2:33:40 PM, 2:33:57 PM) consistently  replace the `window.location.href` method for navigation with `react-router-dom`'s `navigate` function for improved internal routing.


**`BlogDetails.jsx` (Multiple Updates):** This component displays individual blog posts.  The initial version (2:31:49 PM) renders blog post content based on the URL parameter (`slug`). It also includes a Twitter link and displays related blog posts. The crucial change between 2:31:49 PM and 2:36:35 PM involves the replacement of  `window.location.href` with the `navigate` function from `react-router-dom` for handling navigation to related blog posts. The component handles different blog post types ("Case-Study" and others) differently, rendering content accordingly. The code is highly structured and well-organized, using conditional rendering to adapt to different blog post types.
