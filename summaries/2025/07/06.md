# Activity Summary for 7/6/2025

## 12:39:44 PM
The log shows updates to a React frontend component (`EditTeacher.jsx`) for editing teacher details and a Node.js backend controller (`teacherController.js`) handling teacher data.

**`EditTeacher.jsx` (7/6/2025, 11:50:05 AM):** This component allows editing teacher information in a multi-step form.  It fetches teacher data based on `roleBaseData._id`, handles form input, validation, and submission using `useTeacherStore` for data management and `react-router-dom` for navigation.  The form is broken into sections ("Basic Info," "Biographical Info," "Bank Details," "Login Info") using a tabbed interface. Significant changes include the implementation of form validation,  handling of file uploads (photo, resume, intro video), and error handling using `react-hot-toast`.  The component efficiently updates the UI and data based on user interactions and API responses.  Data is handled to maintain data integrity.  It also uses Cloudinary for image and file storage (implied by the file naming convention in the backend code).

**`teacherController.js` (7/6/2025, 12:18:26 PM):**  This controller handles various teacher-related API endpoints.  A significant change is the revision of the `createTeacher` function. The original commented-out version appears to have been replaced with a more concise and efficient version that uses a `$or` query to check for duplicate email or phone numbers and handles error using `next()`. The controller also includes endpoints for getting all teachers (`getTeachers`), getting a single teacher by ID (`getTeacherById`), and updating a teacher (`updateTeacher`). The `getTeachers` function now optionally filters teachers by branch based on the authenticated user's branch.  Error handling is consistent across all functions, returning appropriate status codes and messages.  Cloudinary is used for file storage, as evident from the `uploadImageToCloudinary`, `uploadResumeToCloudinary`, and `uploadVideoToCloudinary` function calls.  The use of Mongoose for database interactions is clearly shown. The function for creating teacher now sends password reset link to teacher's mail after successful teacher creation.


## 1:39:44 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `EditBasicInfo.jsx` and `EditBiographicalInfo.jsx`.  Both are located in the `LMS_dashboard` project.

`EditBasicInfo.jsx` underwent several edits between 1:31 PM and 1:32 PM on July 6th, 2025.  The main change was the addition of a prop, `isTeacher`, which controls the disabling of certain input fields ("First Name", "Last Name", "Email", and "Mobile Number") when the component represents a teacher's profile.  Minor text changes also occurred in "Alternative Number" field label within these commits. The final version at 1:32:54 PM removed the `isTeacher` conditional logic and disabled fields.  The earlier versions, containing the `isTeacher` logic, are commented out.


`EditBiographicalInfo.jsx` was modified between 1:37 PM and 1:38 PM on the same day. This component handles biographical information, including date of birth, marital status, religion, citizenship, teaching mode, branch selection (conditional on teaching mode), gender, profile photo, resume, and an intro video.  The changes involved improvements to the UI, specifically adding error handling using `react-hot-toast` for file uploads (image, resume, video) and branch selection validation.  The component fetches branches using a custom hook `useTeacherStore`, and the state management for file previews is enhanced using the `useEffect` hook.  The file upload sections were significantly refactored to provide better UX with file preview and removal functionality. The minor change was the removal of "oii" in intro video label.


## 3:39:14 PM
The log shows several modifications to `EditBiographicallInfo.jsx` between 1:40 PM and 1:43 PM on July 6th, 2025, primarily focusing on UI adjustments and disabling form fields.  The `maritalStatus` and `teachingMode` select fields were disabled. The `branch` select field was also disabled if the `teachingMode` is "offline".  There were no functional changes to the code logic during this period; only visual changes to the UI elements were made.  Around 1:45 PM, modifications were made to  `EditLoginInof.jsx` (in both `src\components` and `src\page`) changing the email field label and briefly removing the `bg-gray-100` class from the email input before re-adding it and disabling it. The  `EditBasicInfo.jsx` file was modified at 1:49 PM to disable certain input fields ("First Name", "Last Name", "Email", "Mobile Number"). Finally, a `Sidebar.jsx` file was updated at 1:51 PM, but the content of this change is truncated. The `CoursePageStudent.jsx` file shows a fully functional React component for displaying and managing course details for students, including instructor selection and payment processing. This component was updated at 2:04 PM.  The changes across multiple files suggest a potential effort towards improving the UI consistency and potentially disabling editing certain fields in the teacher profile.


## 10:23:13 PM
The provided log shows two nearly identical commits to `CoursePageStudent.jsx` within a short time frame (8 seconds apart).  Both commits contain the same React component code rendering a student's course page.  The code displays course details, instructor selection, session times (if the course is booked), and a payment modal.  No functional changes are apparent between the two commits; they appear to be a duplicate or unintended double commit.  The timestamps are 7/6/2025, 9:26:43 PM and 7/6/2025, 9:26:51 PM.


## 11:23:12 PM
The commit on July 6th, 2025, at 11:14:59 PM, modified `CoursePageStudent.jsx`.  This component renders a course page for students. The changes appear to be primarily focused on UI enhancements and feature additions rather than core logic alterations.  The code shows a React component displaying course details (name, description, price, mode, duration, category, etc.), teacher information (name, contact details, address, teaching mode), and course statistics (number of sessions).  The component also handles teacher selection, payment processing (using a modal which is hinted at but not fully shown in this snippet), and redirects to assignments upon successful course purchase.  There's substantial commented-out code, suggesting features might be under development or have been temporarily removed. The component uses several external libraries including `lucide-react` for icons, and utilizes custom hooks for data fetching from a store (`useDemoCourseStore`, `useSessionStore`).  The `useAuth` hook manages authentication context.  Error handling and loading states are implemented, displaying appropriate messages to the user.
