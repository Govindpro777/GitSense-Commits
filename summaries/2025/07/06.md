# Activity Summary for 7/6/2025

## 12:39:44 PM
The log shows updates to a React frontend component (`EditTeacher.jsx`) for editing teacher details and a Node.js backend controller (`teacherController.js`) handling teacher data.

**`EditTeacher.jsx` (7/6/2025, 11:50:05 AM):** This component allows editing teacher information in a multi-step form.  It fetches teacher data based on `roleBaseData._id`, handles form input, validation, and submission using `useTeacherStore` for data management and `react-router-dom` for navigation.  The form is broken into sections ("Basic Info," "Biographical Info," "Bank Details," "Login Info") using a tabbed interface. Significant changes include the implementation of form validation,  handling of file uploads (photo, resume, intro video), and error handling using `react-hot-toast`.  The component efficiently updates the UI and data based on user interactions and API responses.  Data is handled to maintain data integrity.  It also uses Cloudinary for image and file storage (implied by the file naming convention in the backend code).

**`teacherController.js` (7/6/2025, 12:18:26 PM):**  This controller handles various teacher-related API endpoints.  A significant change is the revision of the `createTeacher` function. The original commented-out version appears to have been replaced with a more concise and efficient version that uses a `$or` query to check for duplicate email or phone numbers and handles error using `next()`. The controller also includes endpoints for getting all teachers (`getTeachers`), getting a single teacher by ID (`getTeacherById`), and updating a teacher (`updateTeacher`). The `getTeachers` function now optionally filters teachers by branch based on the authenticated user's branch.  Error handling is consistent across all functions, returning appropriate status codes and messages.  Cloudinary is used for file storage, as evident from the `uploadImageToCloudinary`, `uploadResumeToCloudinary`, and `uploadVideoToCloudinary` function calls.  The use of Mongoose for database interactions is clearly shown. The function for creating teacher now sends password reset link to teacher's mail after successful teacher creation.
