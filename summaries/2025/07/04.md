# Activity Summary for 7/4/2025

## 12:14:04 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the React components of a blog section within a Next.js application.  The primary files modified are `Hero.jsx`, `BlogCard.jsx`, `BlogPost.jsx`, and `blogData.jsx`.

**`Hero.jsx`**: This file underwent several changes between 12:00:37 AM and 12:12:23 AM.  The most significant change involved removing imports for `lucide-react` icons (`ArrowLeft`, `Calendar`, `User`, `Twitter`) between 12:00:37 AM and 12:02:09 AM, simplifying the hero section's visual elements. Further modifications at 12:09:50 AM transformed this file into a `BlogList` component, iterating through blog posts from `blogData.jsx` and rendering them using `BlogCard` components. The final version at 12:12:23 AM corrected the import path for `blogPosts` to the correct file location.

**`BlogCard.jsx`**: This component, responsible for displaying individual blog posts, was created around 12:09:31 AM and later updated at 12:11:57 AM with a minor fix to the import statement. It uses data from `blogData.jsx` to render blog post previews with images, date, read time, title, author, and excerpt.  The component uses `react-router-dom` for linking.

**`BlogPost.jsx`**: This file, displaying individual blog posts, saw considerable changes.  Initially (12:10:13 AM and 12:11:42 AM), it contained several `lucide-react` icons, richer content display formatting, and included "You might also like" section. Subsequent edits at 12:12:44 AM and 12:13:03 AM removed many of these icons, resulting in a more streamlined and minimalist layout, likely reflecting a design change.  The import of `blogPosts` was also corrected to match the updated `blogData.jsx` location. A crucial bug was present in versions of `BlogPost.jsx` at 12:10:13 AM, 12:11:42 AM, 12:12:44 AM where `blogPosts.find(p => p === id)` was used instead of the proper `blogPosts.find(p => p.id === id)`, resulting in a failure to fetch the correct post.

**`blogData.jsx`**:  This file, containing the blog post data, was updated at 12:11:06 AM.  The structure of the `blogPosts` array changed; the `content` property moved from a nested object to a simple array of strings.  The date was updated in the first post from July 2nd, 2025 to November 2nd, 2024.  The author was changed from "Team Skribe" to "Team Scribe". The `category` changed from "PR & Communications" and "PR Strategy" to "Public Relations".  New blog posts were also added.

In summary, the codebase underwent a redesign focusing on a cleaner UI by removing unnecessary icons, and the introduction of a `BlogList` component to manage displaying multiple posts.  There was a noticeable shift in the structure and content of the blog post data (`blogData.jsx`), and the `BlogPost` component went through multiple revisions, with the corrected use of the `find` method being the most important change.  There's also a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
