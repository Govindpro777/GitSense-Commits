# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 11:20:46 AM
The codebase underwent significant changes related to a signup page (`Signup.jsx`) and its associated constants (`constants.js`).  The initial `page.jsx` file simply imported and rendered the `Signup` component.

Between 10:38 AM and 11:20 AM, `Signup.jsx` evolved substantially.  Early revisions (10:42 AM) featured a comprehensive signup form with extensive validation for organization name, name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password (requiring at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character).  The component used local storage to manage user information and implemented OTP verification.

The `constants.js` file (multiple revisions between 10:43 AM and 10:46 AM) contains API endpoints for various functionalities, including authentication (`LOGINAPI`, `USERINFO`, etc.), free signup (`FREESIGNUP`), and social campaign management.  A notable change was the addition of `SOCIAL_SIGNUP` and `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO`  around 10:46 AM, indicating the introduction of a new social signup flow.

Further revisions of `Signup.jsx` (from 10:56 AM onwards) integrated early access functionality.  The component now uses `useSearchParams` to obtain an early access token, fetches early access information using `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO`, and conditionally renders either a free or social signup form based on the presence of this token (around 11:08 AM).  The final version (11:20 AM) appears to be commented out entirely. This suggests a possible temporary removal or rollback. The import of several modules (`useMetadata`, `SkribeLite`, etc.) was removed in the final revision.  The structure of the import paths for `Navbar` and `Footer` also changed, indicating refactoring of the project's file structure.


## 12:20:55 PM
The `Signup.jsx` component underwent several revisions on July 24, 2025.  The initial version (11:20:49 AM) was heavily commented-out, suggesting it was a work in progress.  Subsequent commits (11:22:39 AM, 11:26:54 AM, 11:44:38 AM, 11:46:05 AM, 11:48:13 AM) progressively removed commented-out code, added functionality, and improved error handling.

Key changes include:

* **Error Handling:**  Significant improvements were made to error handling throughout the signup process.  The code now checks for various error conditions returned by the backend (`BadRequest`, `Error`, `DomainAlready`, `NotWorkingEmailId`, `OrganizationAlready`, `EmailIdAlready`) and displays user-friendly messages.  Alerts are used for some errors.

* **Early Access Flow:** The component now handles early access users using a token obtained from the URL parameters (`searchParams.get('id')`).  The `fetchEarlyAccessInfo` function retrieves user details based on the token.  Successful retrieval of this information now results in a success message.

* **Input Validation:**  Enhanced input validation for the regular signup process was implemented.  Checks were added for organization name length (minimum 3 characters), name length (minimum 3 letters), email validity, and whether the email is a public email domain (using a predefined list), phone number length (minimum 10 digits), and password strength (using a regular expression).

* **API Calls:** The code uses `userService` for API interactions, employing `userService.get` and `userService.post` for retrieving and submitting data, respectively.  Constants (`SOCIAL_SIGNUP`, `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO`, `FREESIGNUP`, `USER_INFO`) are used to define API endpoints. The `constants.js` file, updated at 12:19:50 PM, defines numerous API endpoints for various functionalities. The addition of `USER_INFO` constant in `constants.js` and its corresponding use in `Signup.jsx` at 12:20:26 PM also showcases the consistent use of API calls.

* **OTP Handling:**  The code efficiently manages the OTP input using an array of states and `useRef` hooks to manage focus.

* **Code Cleanup:**  The final versions (11:44:38 AM onwards) are significantly cleaner and more readable, with unnecessary comments removed.

The consistent pattern throughout the updates is the iterative refinement of the signup functionality, adding features, improving error handling, and refining the user experience.  The use of functional components and React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) is consistent across all versions.


## 1:20:51 PM
The log shows a React component (`Signup.jsx`) undergoing significant changes between 12:42 PM and 1:19 PM on July 24, 2025.  The primary focus of the modifications is refining the signup process, handling both regular and early access signups.

Initially, the component had extensive state variables and numerous useEffect hooks for handling OTP input and various aspects of the signup flow.  Around 12:48 PM, a large portion of the code was commented out, suggesting a major refactoring effort.

Subsequent commits (1:01 PM onwards) introduced a unified `handleSignup` function, simplifying the signup logic for both early access and free accounts.  The earlier separate functions (`createSocialAccount`, `createFreeAccount`) were removed.  The API endpoint `SOCIAL_SIGNUP` is now used for both types of signups. The  `handleSignupResponse` function was enhanced to handle a broader range of API responses, providing specific notifications for each case (success, failure reasons).

The use of `showNotification` from  `useNotification` hook (introduced around 1:07 PM) replaces earlier direct message handling, indicating improved error and success message management. Validation logic was also consolidated within `handleSignup`.


Between 1:07 PM and 1:19 PM, the primary changes involved refining the UI rendering.  The most significant updates involve the styling and structure of the signup form, adding background images and adjusting the layout (max-width changes are notable, going from `1170px` to `1270px` in the final commit), as well as removing the second background image (`/assets/social-loginbg1.png`) at 1:17 PM.  The component now uses images for visual enhancements.  These are purely cosmetic changes to the UI.  The core logic remains largely consistent across these final commits.


## 2:20:44 PM
The log shows multiple edits to two React components: `Signup.jsx` and `Navbar.jsx`.

The `Signup.jsx` component underwent substantial changes.  Initially (1:21:34 PM and 1:22:26 PM), it was a comprehensive signup form handling both regular signup and early access signup via a token.  The form validated various fields (organization name, name, email, phone number, password) and handled different responses from the server (`userService.post(SOCIAL_SIGNUP, requestPayload)`), showing appropriate notifications using a custom hook (`useNotification`).  A crucial aspect was the differentiation between early access signup (using a token) and regular signup, with differing validations applied.  The UI included a loading state for early access information retrieval and  used placeholders images (`/assets/social-loginbg2.png`).

A minor but important change occurred between 1:22:26 PM and 2:18:03 PM in `Signup.jsx`.  The entire component's code was commented out. This suggests a temporary removal or disabling of the signup functionality, possibly for debugging or maintenance.

The `Navbar.jsx` component had a minor correction (between 1:23:39 PM and 1:24:23 PM). The link for "Signup" was changed from `/login` to `/signup`, fixing an incorrect route.  The navbar consistently displayed "Signup" and "Login" links.  It used a logo image (`/assets/logo.png`).

The timestamps indicate a period of active development and debugging around 1:21 PM â€“ 1:24 PM, followed by a significant change around 2:18 PM where the Signup component was entirely commented out.  The recurring theme in `Signup.jsx` is extensive input validation and detailed handling of various server responses, demonstrating a focus on robust error handling and user experience.


## 3:20:48 PM
The log shows several revisions to two React components: `Signup.jsx` and `OTP.jsx`.  The changes primarily focus on implementing an OTP (One-Time Password) verification flow within the signup process.

**Signup.jsx:**

The `Signup.jsx` component underwent significant changes between 7/24/2025, 2:21:37 PM and 7/24/2025, 2:51:20 PM.  Initially, the component handled direct signup without OTP.  Later revisions introduced OTP functionality.  Key updates include:

* **OTP Integration:** The most substantial change is the addition of OTP handling. The `handleSignup` function was refactored to first send an OTP upon form submission and then handle subsequent verification of the OTP before finalizing the signup.  New state variables (`otpSent`, `otpValue`) and functions (`handleResendOTP`) were introduced to manage OTP-related state and actions.
* **Import Changes:** The `Loader` component was imported at 2:27:52 PM to display loading indicators during asynchronous operations.
* **Error Handling:**  The component's error handling was improved to provide more specific messages based on different response statuses from the backend.
* **"use client" directive:** Added at 2:27:13 PM, this directive indicates that the component is a client-side component in a Next.js application.
* **Minor UI changes:**  Some minor UI changes are indicated by the partially shown code snippet in the later updates, suggesting ongoing styling refinements.

**OTP.jsx:**

`OTP.jsx` changes occurred between 7/24/2025, 3:06:43 PM and 7/24/2025, 3:11:38 PM. The core functionality remained the same, but it had one significant improvement:


* **Portal Container Management:**  The component was improved to reliably create and manage the React portal.  A cleanup function was added to the `useEffect` hook to remove the portal container when the component unmounts, preventing memory leaks and resolving potential conflicts with other components that might use the same portal ID ("portal").


Overall, the code evolution demonstrates a clear pattern of adding OTP verification to the signup process. The changes were iterative, with each revision building upon the previous one to improve the user experience and error handling.  The final version of `Signup.jsx` incorporates the OTP component (`OTP.jsx`), resulting in a complete, OTP-secured signup flow.
