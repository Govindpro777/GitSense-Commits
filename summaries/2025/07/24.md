# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 11:20:46 AM
The codebase underwent significant changes related to a signup page (`Signup.jsx`) and its associated constants (`constants.js`).  The initial `page.jsx` file simply imported and rendered the `Signup` component.

Between 10:38 AM and 11:20 AM, `Signup.jsx` evolved substantially.  Early revisions (10:42 AM) featured a comprehensive signup form with extensive validation for organization name, name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password (requiring at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character).  The component used local storage to manage user information and implemented OTP verification.

The `constants.js` file (multiple revisions between 10:43 AM and 10:46 AM) contains API endpoints for various functionalities, including authentication (`LOGINAPI`, `USERINFO`, etc.), free signup (`FREESIGNUP`), and social campaign management.  A notable change was the addition of `SOCIAL_SIGNUP` and `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO`  around 10:46 AM, indicating the introduction of a new social signup flow.

Further revisions of `Signup.jsx` (from 10:56 AM onwards) integrated early access functionality.  The component now uses `useSearchParams` to obtain an early access token, fetches early access information using `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO`, and conditionally renders either a free or social signup form based on the presence of this token (around 11:08 AM).  The final version (11:20 AM) appears to be commented out entirely. This suggests a possible temporary removal or rollback. The import of several modules (`useMetadata`, `SkribeLite`, etc.) was removed in the final revision.  The structure of the import paths for `Navbar` and `Footer` also changed, indicating refactoring of the project's file structure.
