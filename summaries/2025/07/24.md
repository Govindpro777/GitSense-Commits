# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 11:20:46 AM
The codebase underwent significant changes related to a signup page (`Signup.jsx`) and its associated constants (`constants.js`).  The initial `page.jsx` file simply imported and rendered the `Signup` component.

Between 10:38 AM and 11:20 AM, `Signup.jsx` evolved substantially.  Early revisions (10:42 AM) featured a comprehensive signup form with extensive validation for organization name, name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password (requiring at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character).  The component used local storage to manage user information and implemented OTP verification.

The `constants.js` file (multiple revisions between 10:43 AM and 10:46 AM) contains API endpoints for various functionalities, including authentication (`LOGINAPI`, `USERINFO`, etc.), free signup (`FREESIGNUP`), and social campaign management.  A notable change was the addition of `SOCIAL_SIGNUP` and `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO`  around 10:46 AM, indicating the introduction of a new social signup flow.

Further revisions of `Signup.jsx` (from 10:56 AM onwards) integrated early access functionality.  The component now uses `useSearchParams` to obtain an early access token, fetches early access information using `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO`, and conditionally renders either a free or social signup form based on the presence of this token (around 11:08 AM).  The final version (11:20 AM) appears to be commented out entirely. This suggests a possible temporary removal or rollback. The import of several modules (`useMetadata`, `SkribeLite`, etc.) was removed in the final revision.  The structure of the import paths for `Navbar` and `Footer` also changed, indicating refactoring of the project's file structure.


## 12:20:55 PM
The `Signup.jsx` component underwent several revisions on July 24, 2025.  The initial version (11:20:49 AM) was heavily commented-out, suggesting it was a work in progress.  Subsequent commits (11:22:39 AM, 11:26:54 AM, 11:44:38 AM, 11:46:05 AM, 11:48:13 AM) progressively removed commented-out code, added functionality, and improved error handling.

Key changes include:

* **Error Handling:**  Significant improvements were made to error handling throughout the signup process.  The code now checks for various error conditions returned by the backend (`BadRequest`, `Error`, `DomainAlready`, `NotWorkingEmailId`, `OrganizationAlready`, `EmailIdAlready`) and displays user-friendly messages.  Alerts are used for some errors.

* **Early Access Flow:** The component now handles early access users using a token obtained from the URL parameters (`searchParams.get('id')`).  The `fetchEarlyAccessInfo` function retrieves user details based on the token.  Successful retrieval of this information now results in a success message.

* **Input Validation:**  Enhanced input validation for the regular signup process was implemented.  Checks were added for organization name length (minimum 3 characters), name length (minimum 3 letters), email validity, and whether the email is a public email domain (using a predefined list), phone number length (minimum 10 digits), and password strength (using a regular expression).

* **API Calls:** The code uses `userService` for API interactions, employing `userService.get` and `userService.post` for retrieving and submitting data, respectively.  Constants (`SOCIAL_SIGNUP`, `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO`, `FREESIGNUP`, `USER_INFO`) are used to define API endpoints. The `constants.js` file, updated at 12:19:50 PM, defines numerous API endpoints for various functionalities. The addition of `USER_INFO` constant in `constants.js` and its corresponding use in `Signup.jsx` at 12:20:26 PM also showcases the consistent use of API calls.

* **OTP Handling:**  The code efficiently manages the OTP input using an array of states and `useRef` hooks to manage focus.

* **Code Cleanup:**  The final versions (11:44:38 AM onwards) are significantly cleaner and more readable, with unnecessary comments removed.

The consistent pattern throughout the updates is the iterative refinement of the signup functionality, adding features, improving error handling, and refining the user experience.  The use of functional components and React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) is consistent across all versions.
