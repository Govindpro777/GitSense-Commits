# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 10:21:55 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a React component (`Signup.jsx`) responsible for user signup functionality, along with a `constants.js` file defining various API endpoints.  The `Signup.jsx` component underwent several revisions between 9:46 AM and 10:03 AM on July 25, 2025, but the code itself remained largely unchanged across these revisions.  The code implements a signup form with validation for organization name, name, email, phone number, and password. It handles both standard signup and early access signup using a token.  The component uses a 4-digit OTP verification process. A significant amount of commented-out code suggests potential experimentation or refactoring.

The `constants.js` file, updated at 9:55:39 AM, defines numerous API endpoints, many related to social media campaigns (`SOCIAL_CAMPAIGN_CREATION`, `GET_CATEGORY_OPTIONS`, etc.), user authentication (`LOGINAPI`, `REFRESHTOKEN_API`, `SOCIAL_SIGNUP`), and other features. The endpoints appear to be constructed using environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.  The presence of `SOCIAL_SIGNUP` and `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO` constants correlates with the functionality seen in the `Signup.jsx` component.

The provided log shows multiple revisions of a React component (`Signup.jsx`) handling user signup.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on user input validation, API calls to a `userService`, and handling various response statuses.

The file `Signup.jsx` underwent several modifications between 10:32 AM and 10:56 AM on July 25, 2025.  These changes primarily involved refining the handling of signup responses.

Initially, the `handleSignupResponse` function handled multiple response statuses ("Ok", "ActiveUser", "AlreadySocialUser", "InActiveUser", "AlreadySignUp", and "BadRequest") with similar logic, storing user data in localStorage and navigating to the '/summary' page for successful signups.

The most significant change occurred between 10:53 AM and 10:56 AM. In this update, the `handleSignupResponse` function was modified to remove the `userInfo()` call and the subsequent navigation to '/summary' for the "InActiveUser" status. This suggests a change in the desired behavior for inactive users, possibly handling this scenario differently now.  There also appears to be an attempt to include additional handling for a "BadRequest" status at 10:56 AM.  The code was cut off before the full implementation could be seen.


Throughout all revisions, the component consistently uses:

*   `userService` for API interactions (GET requests for early access info and user info, POST requests for signup).
*   `localStorage` to store user data.
*   `useNotification` hook for displaying alerts to the user.
*   Extensive input validation before submitting the signup request.

No structural changes to the component are observed; the modifications focus on the logic within existing functions, particularly `handleSignupResponse`.
