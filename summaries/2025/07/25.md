# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 10:21:55 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a React component (`Signup.jsx`) responsible for user signup functionality, along with a `constants.js` file defining various API endpoints.  The `Signup.jsx` component underwent several revisions between 9:46 AM and 10:03 AM on July 25, 2025, but the code itself remained largely unchanged across these revisions.  The code implements a signup form with validation for organization name, name, email, phone number, and password. It handles both standard signup and early access signup using a token.  The component uses a 4-digit OTP verification process. A significant amount of commented-out code suggests potential experimentation or refactoring.

The `constants.js` file, updated at 9:55:39 AM, defines numerous API endpoints, many related to social media campaigns (`SOCIAL_CAMPAIGN_CREATION`, `GET_CATEGORY_OPTIONS`, etc.), user authentication (`LOGINAPI`, `REFRESHTOKEN_API`, `SOCIAL_SIGNUP`), and other features. The endpoints appear to be constructed using environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.  The presence of `SOCIAL_SIGNUP` and `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO` constants correlates with the functionality seen in the `Signup.jsx` component.


## 11:21:55 AM
The provided log shows multiple revisions of a React component (`Signup.jsx`) handling user signup.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on user input validation, API calls to a `userService`, and handling various response statuses.

The file `Signup.jsx` underwent several modifications between 10:32 AM and 10:56 AM on July 25, 2025.  These changes primarily involved refining the handling of signup responses.

Initially, the `handleSignupResponse` function handled multiple response statuses ("Ok", "ActiveUser", "AlreadySocialUser", "InActiveUser", "AlreadySignUp", and "BadRequest") with similar logic, storing user data in localStorage and navigating to the '/summary' page for successful signups.

The most significant change occurred between 10:53 AM and 10:56 AM. In this update, the `handleSignupResponse` function was modified to remove the `userInfo()` call and the subsequent navigation to '/summary' for the "InActiveUser" status. This suggests a change in the desired behavior for inactive users, possibly handling this scenario differently now.  There also appears to be an attempt to include additional handling for a "BadRequest" status at 10:56 AM.  The code was cut off before the full implementation could be seen.


Throughout all revisions, the component consistently uses:

*   `userService` for API interactions (GET requests for early access info and user info, POST requests for signup).
*   `localStorage` to store user data.
*   `useNotification` hook for displaying alerts to the user.
*   Extensive input validation before submitting the signup request.

No structural changes to the component are observed; the modifications focus on the logic within existing functions, particularly `handleSignupResponse`.


## 12:09:12 PM
The log shows changes made to the `.gitignore` and `package.json` files of an ERP/CRM backend project on July 25, 2025.

The `.gitignore` file was updated twice within a minute (11:32 AM and 11:33 AM).  The initial version ignored several common files and folders, and the second version additionally included `.env`. This suggests an intentional effort to exclude environment-specific configurations from version control.

The `package.json` file was updated twice, with minor difference between the two versions (12:03:31 PM and 12:03:41 PM). The changes are insignificant,  as only the `dev` script was modified (removal of `// for local dev` comment).  The file details the project's dependencies, scripts (including setup, upgrade, and reset scripts), and metadata.  It uses Node.js version 20.9.0 and npm version 10.2.4, and lists numerous dependencies, notably including  MongoDB, Express.js, and several other packages for authentication, file upload, and PDF generation.  The use of `dotenv` suggests environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file.
