# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 10:21:55 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a React component (`Signup.jsx`) responsible for user signup functionality, along with a `constants.js` file defining various API endpoints.  The `Signup.jsx` component underwent several revisions between 9:46 AM and 10:03 AM on July 25, 2025, but the code itself remained largely unchanged across these revisions.  The code implements a signup form with validation for organization name, name, email, phone number, and password. It handles both standard signup and early access signup using a token.  The component uses a 4-digit OTP verification process. A significant amount of commented-out code suggests potential experimentation or refactoring.

The `constants.js` file, updated at 9:55:39 AM, defines numerous API endpoints, many related to social media campaigns (`SOCIAL_CAMPAIGN_CREATION`, `GET_CATEGORY_OPTIONS`, etc.), user authentication (`LOGINAPI`, `REFRESHTOKEN_API`, `SOCIAL_SIGNUP`), and other features. The endpoints appear to be constructed using environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.  The presence of `SOCIAL_SIGNUP` and `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO` constants correlates with the functionality seen in the `Signup.jsx` component.
