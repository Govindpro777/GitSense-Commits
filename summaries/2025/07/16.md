# Activity Summary for 7/16/2025

## 1:27:00 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files (`Insights.jsx` and `Stats.jsx`) between 7/15/2025 and 7/16/2025.  The majority of changes are concentrated within a short timeframe on 7/15/2025 between approximately 4:52 PM and 5:19 PM.  `Insights.jsx` undergoes numerous updates during this period, while `Stats.jsx` sees only two revisions, around 5:24 PM.

**Insights.jsx:** This component appears to be a dashboard displaying influencer campaign insights.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative development and debugging. The code is primarily comprised of React state management (`useState`, `useEffect`), data manipulation functions (adding, updating, removing rows), and commented-out imports.  There is no substantial change in functionality identified across all revisions. The data structure for `engagedInfluencers` and `shortlistedInfluencers`  uses arrays of objects with consistent properties (id, name, username, verified, etc.).  The `deliverableRows` and `engageRows` states are used to manage tabular data, likely for campaign deliverables and engagement details.  The code also includes a dropdown menu for campaign selection.

**Stats.jsx:** This component renders various statistics using `ReactApexChart` for pie and line charts. The two revisions show only minor adjustments, possibly styling or minor data updates. The first revision contained incorrect table header order which was later fixed. The component displays key statistics such as total views, expected views, engagement rates and social media likes/comments along with a tabular view of data linked to external resources.  The data for both charts and the table is hardcoded within the component.

The frequent edits in `Insights.jsx` suggest a work-in-progress state, while the stability of `Stats.jsx` indicates a more polished component.  There is no clear pattern indicating any specific functional changes apart from initial minor header order correction in `Stats.jsx`.


## 10:03:01 AM
The log shows a single code update to `Navigation.js` on July 16, 2025, at 9:53:37 AM.  This file contains React code for a navigation component, including a responsive menu and authentication features.

The update implements a navigation bar with links to Home, About Us, Courses, Contact Us, and More pages.  It also includes a mobile menu toggle and a section for user authentication (login/logout/registration).  The authentication section utilizes mock data for demonstration purposes.  The styling uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design and visual elements.  The component dynamically adapts its layout for different screen sizes. A commented-out link to "Products" suggests a previous iteration or planned feature.  The navigation bar also incorporates contact information (phone number and email) displayed at the top.  The logo uses an image (`/Dunamis.png`).  The code employs a variety of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing component state and handling user interactions (like scroll events and menu toggling).


## 12:03:01 PM
The commit on July 16, 2025, at 10:46:08 AM modifies `Navigation.js`, a React component responsible for the navigation bar of a website (likely an LMS).  The code implements a navigation bar with features for both logged-in and logged-out users.  The navigation includes links to Home, About Us, Courses, Contact Us, and More.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to styling using Tailwind CSS classes, resulting in a visually appealing navigation bar with smooth transitions and hover effects.  The component also includes mock authentication logic using React's `useState` hook, allowing for simulated login and logout functionality.  Mobile responsiveness is addressed with a toggleable mobile menu.  The updated code uses Next.js's `Link` component for internal navigation and includes links to external resources.  The styling is consistent and uses a color palette centered around blue and teal, and it also includes contact information such as phone number and email.


## 1:03:15 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Insights.jsx` and one revision to `SocialSummary.jsx`  between 9:06 AM and 1:01 PM on July 16, 2025.

`Insights.jsx`:  The majority of changes in `Insights.jsx` revolve around managing and displaying influencer deliverables.  Initial versions contained basic state management for  `deliverableRows` and `engageRows`,  functions to add, update, and remove rows,  and placeholder data for engaged and shortlisted influencers.  Subsequent commits added functionality to save valid deliverables for selected influencers, improved the UI for adding and displaying deliverables, and added a total cost calculation.  There's also some minor UI adjustments and the addition of a campaign description and date. The most significant change was the addition of an effect hook to automatically add a new row to `deliverableRows` when the last row contains data.  The `dummyCreators` array, used in the engage influencers section, was also modified several times, changing the influencer data and eventually adding a "Add Manually" option with search functionality.  Finally, the `closeNewPopup` function was enhanced to reset more state variables.


`SocialSummary.jsx`: This component shows a summary of social media campaigns. The revision at 9:41:28 AM adds functionality for filtering campaigns by status ("All", "Draft", "Sent"), date range (start and end dates), and search term. It uses `userService` to fetch campaign data, handles loading states, implements infinite scrolling, and dynamically updates the campaign status based on scheduled and sent dates.  The component includes a search input with an "Enter" key press functionality, as well as date input for filtering. There's also a button to create new campaigns.


## 2:03:07 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Insights.jsx` between 1:04 PM and 1:28 PM on July 16, 2025.  The component manages influencer data, including deliverables and engagement.  Key changes across the revisions include:

* **UI Enhancements:**  Several commits focus on refining the UI, adding elements like a heading ("Sparkles Chocolate Launch for Delhi Audience" in one revision) and improving the visual presentation of deliverables using Tailwind CSS classes.

* **Search Functionality:**  A search feature was added, allowing filtering of `dummyCreators` based on name or handle.  This involved adding `searchValue` and `setSearchValue` state variables, and updating the `filteredCreators` state based on the search input.  The order of elements in the `dummyCreators` array was also changed in one commit.

* **Data Handling:** The component consistently handles lists of deliverables and engaged influencers.  Functions for adding, updating, and removing rows in these lists are consistently present and appear to be well-structured.  The `influencerDeliverables` state stores deliverables associated with specific influencers.

* **Dropdown improvements:** The dropdown for campaign selection was enhanced to support expanding and collapsing categories. The `dropdownData` array defines the structure of the dropdown options.

The changes follow a pattern of iterative refinement, adding features and improving the user interface gradually.  The major additions were search functionality and UI enhancements.  The core data management logic remained largely consistent throughout the revisions.


## 3:04:36 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `Insights.jsx`, a React component likely responsible for displaying influencer insights.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions, focusing on displaying and managing influencer data, deliverables, and engagement.  Significant changes were made between approximately 2:05 PM and 2:12 PM, and again around 2:32 PM to 2:53 PM.


The primary changes involve:

* **Event Handling and State Management:**  The component extensively uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the UI state, including popups (`isPopupOpen`, `isEngagePopupOpen`), dropdown menus (`isDropdownOpen`, `isDropdownVisible`), and data tables (`deliverableRows`, `engageRows`).  The `useEffect` hook is used to implement click-outside handling for closing dropdown menus.  Specifically, between 2:05 PM and 2:12 PM, a `mousedown` event listener was added to handle closing popups and dropdowns.  The addition of `engageRef` and the corresponding conditional statement within `handleClickOutside` refined the closing logic for the engagement related elements.
* **Data Structures:** Hardcoded data for `engagedInfluencers` and `shortlistedInfluencers` remains unchanged.  The `dropdownData` array, defining campaign selection options (including categories and subcategories), also remains static.  `deliverableRows` and `engageRows` are dynamically updated using state management functions (`addDeliverableRow`, `updateDeliverableRow`, `removeDeliverableRow`, etc.).
* **UI Enhancements:** The code includes numerous class names suggesting styling with a framework like Tailwind CSS.  Minor stylistic changes may have been introduced throughout the revisions, although the core structure of the UI remains consistent. The addition of a '+' button for adding deliverables was also implemented.

The revisions between 2:32 PM and 2:53 PM appear to primarily refine the `handleClickOutside` function for better closure of popups and dropdowns, specifically to address issues with dropdown visibility.  There were no major structural code changes during this period.  Throughout the entire log, the component's functionality centers around displaying influencer information, allowing users to add and manage deliverables, and handle offline engagement.


## 4:03:05 PM
The `Insights.jsx` component was updated on July 16, 2025, at 3:05:33 PM.  This component manages influencer data, including deliverables and engagement.  Significant changes involve the addition of extensive state management using `useState` for tracking various aspects like popup visibility (`isPopupOpen`, `isEngagePopupOpen`), selected influencer (`selectedInfluencer`), dropdown state (`isDropdownOpen`, `selectedOption`), expanded categories (`expandedCategories`),  deliverable rows (`deliverableRows`), and engagement rows (`engageRows`).  The component uses several helper functions to manage these rows (adding, updating, removing).  There's a dropdown menu (`dropdownData`) for campaign selection with categories and subcategories.  Click handling outside the dropdown closes it.  The component renders tables of shortlisted and engaged influencers, with functionality to add deliverables to influencers.  Deliverables are tracked in `influencerDeliverables`.  There's also functionality to manually add engaged influencers with search and filtering (`searchValue`, `filteredCreators`). Finally, the component calculates the total cost of deliverables for each influencer (`calculateTotalCost`).  The use of React's `useRef` hook is apparent for managing DOM elements and external event listeners.  The code extensively uses functional components and state management best practices.  Hardcoded data for engaged and shortlisted influencers is present, indicating potential need for data fetching integration in future updates.


## 5:03:07 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `Choose.jsx` and `Insights.jsx`.  The changes span approximately an hour, from 4:03 PM to 5:01 PM on July 16, 2025.

**`Choose.jsx` Updates:** This file underwent numerous revisions focused primarily on styling adjustments.  The changes involved minor tweaks to text sizes (`text-[16px]`, `md:text-[18px]`, etc.),  dimensions of divs and images (`w-[300px]`, `h-[450px]`, `max-w-[160px]`), and background colors. There's a pattern of repeated adjustments to the dimensions of the divs containing "Skribe" and "Socion" logos, reducing both the width and height of the containers across multiple commits. The font size of the dummy copy paragraph was also adjusted repeatedly.  These modifications suggest iterative design refinements for the layout of the social landing page.

**`Insights.jsx` Updates:**  This component shows a more substantial evolution.  Initial commits contain a largely static UI with hardcoded data for influencers and deliverables. Later commits introduce:

* **API Integration:**  Significant additions include imports for `userService`, `useNotification`, and various constants related to API endpoints (`GET_CAMPAIGN_INSIGHTS`, `ENGAGED_BY_ID`, etc.).  Functions like `getInsightsData`, `handleEngageById`, and `removeShortlistedCreator` demonstrate the implementation of asynchronous API calls using `userService` for fetching and manipulating data.
* **Dynamic Data Handling:** The component transitions from using static `useState` arrays for `engagedInfluencers`, `shortlistedInfluencers`, and `deliverableRows` to fetching data from APIs.  This is evident in the introduction of calls to these API endpoints and updating of state variables.  
* **Error Handling & Notifications:** Integration of  `useNotification` for displaying success or warning messages based on API responses.

The final `Insights.jsx` version is a fully functional component interacting with backend services.  The changes reflect a progressive shift from a prototype to a production-ready component.  The earlier versions lacked crucial functionality and were likely used for initial styling and layout design.


## 11:50:23 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `layout.js` and `Navigation.js` files within a React application, likely a Learning Management System (LMS) frontend.  Significant changes occurred between 11:16 PM and 11:30 PM on July 16, 2025.

**`layout.js` Updates:**

Initially, `layout.js` contained commented-out code, suggesting components were being progressively added or removed.  The file evolved to include essential navigation (`Navigation`), authentication (`AuthProvider`), and footer (`Footer2`) elements.  Importantly, many initially included components like `Footer`, `RequestCallback`, `TeachersTestimonials`, `Testimonials`, `FAQ`, and `Contactus` were removed, indicating a refactoring or simplification process. The final version uses  `ToastContainer` for notifications and `WhatsAppIcon` for contact information, both consistently present throughout the changes.


**`Navigation.js` Updates:**

The `Navigation.js` file underwent substantial changes between 11:29 PM and 11:49 PM on July 16, 2025.  Initially, it was entirely commented-out. The final version is a fully functional navigation component featuring a responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices, utilizing Lucide-React icons. It includes navigation links ("Home," "About Us," "Courses," "Contact Us"), user authentication, and contact information.  The mobile version includes a functional hamburger menu that opens and closes using state management.  There is a consistent use of styled components and a common design pattern across elements.  A significant portion of the component involves conditional rendering based on user authentication status, providing login and register links if a user is not logged in and a dashboard and logout links if they are.


**`page.js` Updates:**

The `page.js` file, representing the main page content, underwent a single, substantial update between 11:24 PM and 11:24 PM on July 16, 2025.  Initially, the file had commented out code for various landing page components, before being updated to include a functional component that renders several landing page components, including `LandingSection`, `AboutUs`, `AboutUsSection`, `TeachingNeeds`, `DeliverMonetize`, `FreeLMS`, and `FeaturesSection`.  In the final version,  `TeachersTeastimonials`, `Testimonials`, `FAQ`, and `Contactus` components were also added to the rendered content.  The change indicates a substantial expansion of the home page's displayed content.


The overall pattern suggests iterative development with refactoring and adjustments to component inclusion based on design choices and possibly user experience testing.  The timestamps indicate a period of intense development and refinement within a short time frame.
