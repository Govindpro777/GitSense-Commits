# Activity Summary for 7/16/2025

## 1:27:00 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files (`Insights.jsx` and `Stats.jsx`) between 7/15/2025 and 7/16/2025.  The majority of changes are concentrated within a short timeframe on 7/15/2025 between approximately 4:52 PM and 5:19 PM.  `Insights.jsx` undergoes numerous updates during this period, while `Stats.jsx` sees only two revisions, around 5:24 PM.

**Insights.jsx:** This component appears to be a dashboard displaying influencer campaign insights.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative development and debugging. The code is primarily comprised of React state management (`useState`, `useEffect`), data manipulation functions (adding, updating, removing rows), and commented-out imports.  There is no substantial change in functionality identified across all revisions. The data structure for `engagedInfluencers` and `shortlistedInfluencers`  uses arrays of objects with consistent properties (id, name, username, verified, etc.).  The `deliverableRows` and `engageRows` states are used to manage tabular data, likely for campaign deliverables and engagement details.  The code also includes a dropdown menu for campaign selection.

**Stats.jsx:** This component renders various statistics using `ReactApexChart` for pie and line charts. The two revisions show only minor adjustments, possibly styling or minor data updates. The first revision contained incorrect table header order which was later fixed. The component displays key statistics such as total views, expected views, engagement rates and social media likes/comments along with a tabular view of data linked to external resources.  The data for both charts and the table is hardcoded within the component.

The frequent edits in `Insights.jsx` suggest a work-in-progress state, while the stability of `Stats.jsx` indicates a more polished component.  There is no clear pattern indicating any specific functional changes apart from initial minor header order correction in `Stats.jsx`.

The log shows a single code update to `Navigation.js` on July 16, 2025, at 9:53:37 AM.  This file contains React code for a navigation component, including a responsive menu and authentication features.

The update implements a navigation bar with links to Home, About Us, Courses, Contact Us, and More pages.  It also includes a mobile menu toggle and a section for user authentication (login/logout/registration).  The authentication section utilizes mock data for demonstration purposes.  The styling uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design and visual elements.  The component dynamically adapts its layout for different screen sizes. A commented-out link to "Products" suggests a previous iteration or planned feature.  The navigation bar also incorporates contact information (phone number and email) displayed at the top.  The logo uses an image (`/Dunamis.png`).  The code employs a variety of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing component state and handling user interactions (like scroll events and menu toggling).

The commit on July 16, 2025, at 10:46:08 AM modifies `Navigation.js`, a React component responsible for the navigation bar of a website (likely an LMS).  The code implements a navigation bar with features for both logged-in and logged-out users.  The navigation includes links to Home, About Us, Courses, Contact Us, and More.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to styling using Tailwind CSS classes, resulting in a visually appealing navigation bar with smooth transitions and hover effects.  The component also includes mock authentication logic using React's `useState` hook, allowing for simulated login and logout functionality.  Mobile responsiveness is addressed with a toggleable mobile menu.  The updated code uses Next.js's `Link` component for internal navigation and includes links to external resources.  The styling is consistent and uses a color palette centered around blue and teal, and it also includes contact information such as phone number and email.
