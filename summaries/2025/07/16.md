# Activity Summary for 7/16/2025

## 1:27:00 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files (`Insights.jsx` and `Stats.jsx`) between 7/15/2025 and 7/16/2025.  The majority of changes are concentrated within a short timeframe on 7/15/2025 between approximately 4:52 PM and 5:19 PM.  `Insights.jsx` undergoes numerous updates during this period, while `Stats.jsx` sees only two revisions, around 5:24 PM.

**Insights.jsx:** This component appears to be a dashboard displaying influencer campaign insights.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative development and debugging. The code is primarily comprised of React state management (`useState`, `useEffect`), data manipulation functions (adding, updating, removing rows), and commented-out imports.  There is no substantial change in functionality identified across all revisions. The data structure for `engagedInfluencers` and `shortlistedInfluencers`  uses arrays of objects with consistent properties (id, name, username, verified, etc.).  The `deliverableRows` and `engageRows` states are used to manage tabular data, likely for campaign deliverables and engagement details.  The code also includes a dropdown menu for campaign selection.

**Stats.jsx:** This component renders various statistics using `ReactApexChart` for pie and line charts. The two revisions show only minor adjustments, possibly styling or minor data updates. The first revision contained incorrect table header order which was later fixed. The component displays key statistics such as total views, expected views, engagement rates and social media likes/comments along with a tabular view of data linked to external resources.  The data for both charts and the table is hardcoded within the component.

The frequent edits in `Insights.jsx` suggest a work-in-progress state, while the stability of `Stats.jsx` indicates a more polished component.  There is no clear pattern indicating any specific functional changes apart from initial minor header order correction in `Stats.jsx`.
