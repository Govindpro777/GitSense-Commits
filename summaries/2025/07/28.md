# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 1:48:21 PM
The log shows changes across three files within the `Skribe-Backend` project.  The most significant changes are in `MediaListPage.tsx`.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts` (7/28/2025, 12:49:53 PM):** This file contains an Axios instance setup for making API requests.  It includes token handling with refresh token functionality.  The `baseURL` is configurable and can point to different environments (localhost, beta, or production).  Error handling is implemented, including network error handling and session expiry checks.  The `Alert` component is used to display success and error messages to the user.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Media\MediaListTable.tsx` (7/28/2025, 12:50:44 PM and 7/28/2025, 12:54:24 PM):** This component renders a table to display media list data. The two updates show a minor correction from `S.N0o` to `S.No` in the table header.  The delete functionality is present in the code but commented out (`{/* ... */}`). The component handles viewing and editing media items using `react-router-dom`'s `useNavigate` hook. A modal is used to confirm delete operations.  There's commented-out code suggesting a previous implementation using `mantine-datatable` library which was replaced with a custom table implementation.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Media\MediaListPage.tsx` (7/28/2025, 12:58:03 PM, 1:07:12 PM, and 7/28/2025, 1:23:00 PM):**  This component displays a list of media items. The initial version used a single API call.  Subsequent commits improved data fetching by handling pagination and fetching all data in chunks using a `while` loop, eliminating the need for multiple requests.  A loading state is added and displayed while data is being fetched.  The total number of items is displayed on the page, and the "Create Media" button is disabled while loading. The overall structure is consistent across revisions, focusing on fetching data, displaying a table, and creating a media item.  The pagination logic using `token` in the API response for efficient data loading is a noteworthy improvement.  The  `MediaListFilter` component is present but not yet fully implemented (`{/* ... */}`).
