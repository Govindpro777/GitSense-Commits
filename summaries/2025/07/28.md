# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 1:48:21 PM
The log shows changes across three files within the `Skribe-Backend` project.  The most significant changes are in `MediaListPage.tsx`.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts` (7/28/2025, 12:49:53 PM):** This file contains an Axios instance setup for making API requests.  It includes token handling with refresh token functionality.  The `baseURL` is configurable and can point to different environments (localhost, beta, or production).  Error handling is implemented, including network error handling and session expiry checks.  The `Alert` component is used to display success and error messages to the user.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Media\MediaListTable.tsx` (7/28/2025, 12:50:44 PM and 7/28/2025, 12:54:24 PM):** This component renders a table to display media list data. The two updates show a minor correction from `S.N0o` to `S.No` in the table header.  The delete functionality is present in the code but commented out (`{/* ... */}`). The component handles viewing and editing media items using `react-router-dom`'s `useNavigate` hook. A modal is used to confirm delete operations.  There's commented-out code suggesting a previous implementation using `mantine-datatable` library which was replaced with a custom table implementation.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Media\MediaListPage.tsx` (7/28/2025, 12:58:03 PM, 1:07:12 PM, and 7/28/2025, 1:23:00 PM):**  This component displays a list of media items. The initial version used a single API call.  Subsequent commits improved data fetching by handling pagination and fetching all data in chunks using a `while` loop, eliminating the need for multiple requests.  A loading state is added and displayed while data is being fetched.  The total number of items is displayed on the page, and the "Create Media" button is disabled while loading. The overall structure is consistent across revisions, focusing on fetching data, displaying a table, and creating a media item.  The pagination logic using `token` in the API response for efficient data loading is a noteworthy improvement.  The  `MediaListFilter` component is present but not yet fully implemented (`{/* ... */}`).


## 2:49:14 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to four React component files related to a journalist management system.  All files extensively use the `userService` for API calls to endpoints like `GetJournalistBackend`, `outlet-search`, `userpreference/media`, `userpreference/beat`, and `Customer/Get-Users-of-Customer`.  A recurring theme is data fetching, filtering, and display within data tables using the `mantine-datatable` library.  Column visibility is frequently controlled by the user.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Journalist\Journalists.tsx` (Two Revisions): This file shows a journalist listing component.  Changes between the two revisions were minor, primarily correcting a typo in the "Total Record" display from "fdsd-" to "-". The component fetches data based on applied filters (which are persisted in the URL), allowing for pagination and sorting.  A search functionality is implemented.  The component utilizes a dropdown to allow column hiding and showing.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Journalist\JournalistTable.tsx` (Two Revisions): This file displays a table of journalists with edit capabilities via links to `/journalist/edit/{id}`.  The major changes involve using an `AsyncSelect` component for filtering by outlet, which uses debouncing to optimize API calls.  The same functionality to show and hide columns from the `Journalists.tsx` file is also implemented here.  Fetching is also done using the `userService` with a  `GetJournalistBackend` API endpoint.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Journalist\Auto-build\BuildJournalist.tsx`: This component displays a list of journalists needing to be built and allows for assigning them. The component uses SignalR (`@microsoft/signalr`) for real-time updates using the `/notificationHub` endpoint.  Data is fetched from `/journalist/NewDiscovery` and updated via `/journalist/NewDiscovery/Update`.  It utilizes a simple table for display.  The component uses a redux dispatch function `buildJournalistData` to update the redux state, showing a clear integration between a component and a redux store.

`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Scribe Intern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Journalist\Auto-Refresh\RefreshJournalist.tsx` (Four Revisions): This file represents a journalist refresh component with extensive filtering options (outlet, media, beat, user, status, author URL existence).  The evolution of this component shows additions of filters throughout the different revisions.  It uses `react-select` for multiple filter selections.  The date pickers using the `react-flatpickr` library were added throughout the revisions.  The `userService` is heavily utilized with a `GetAutoRefreshJournalists` endpoint for fetching data.  There is a significant use of debouncing in the data fetching logic to improve performance. The component similarly allows for the showing and hiding of columns.  The final revision appears to have mostly cosmetic and minor functional changes.

Across all files, there's consistent use of a custom `userService` for API interactions and a common design pattern for data table rendering and filtering.  The repeated use of the `showHideColumns` function shows the importance of column customization.  The multiple revisions to `RefreshJournalist.tsx` suggest iterative development and refinement of the filtering capabilities.


## 3:38:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `MONTHLY_2.html` between 2:38 PM and 2:46 PM on July 28, 2025.  The file is an HTML email newsletter, likely a monthly or weekly digest, titled "June 2025 Newsletter" or "Skribe Monthly Digest" (the title changes in later revisions).

The main content consistently features:

* **Skribe's New Feature Releases:** Highlighting "Press Release Distribution" and "Regional Vernacular Tracking."
* **Key Event of the Month:**  Initially, the IABC World Conference 2025 is mentioned; this is later replaced with the Indian Digital Marketing Awards (IDMA) 2025.
* **Journalist of the Month:** Initially Peerzada Abrar, then replaced by Shilpa Phadnis.  The publication is consistently listed as Business Standard, then later changed to The Times of India. The "Recent Story" also changes.
* **Key Appointments & Industry Updates:**  This section includes new product launches and key appointments in the communications and media space.  The updates here also change over revisions.
* **Call to action:**  A consistent call to action to try Skribe's paid press release distribution service.

The most significant changes occur in the header and formatting. Early versions utilize a header image (`mailerHeader.png`), while later versions switch to `mailerHeader1.png` and refine the logo placement and styling, including addition of  `height` and `class` attributes to the logo image. The headline font size and margins are also adjusted across versions.  The initial versions of the header section are eventually commented out.  The newsletter's title also changes from "Monthly Digest" to "Weekly" and back to "Monthly Digest."  There are subtle wording changes throughout the body text as well, aimed at making the text more concise and impactful.  The overall structure and content remain largely the same across all revisions.
