# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 11:10:35 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `AllAdmins.jsx` and `StudentsRegister.jsx`, both focused on displaying and managing data in a dashboard-like interface.  The changes made to `AllAdmins.jsx` between 1:08 AM and 1:18 AM appear to be minor formatting adjustments or possibly due to an IDE auto-formatting feature; the code content remains essentially the same across these revisions. This component displays a list of admins, allowing for searching, filtering by mode, pagination, and export to Excel.

The `StudentsRegister.jsx` component undergoes more substantial changes between 1:26 AM and 1:31 AM. Initially, the component shows a list of students with features for searching, filtering by status, sorting by name, email, or date of birth, pagination, selection for bulk deletion, and export to Excel. A significant update at 1:31 AM removes almost all the component's functionality, leaving behind only comments of the original code.  This suggests a complete rewrite or temporary removal of the component's functionality may have taken place.  Both components share a common pattern: they use React, data fetching (from APIs and stores), pagination, sorting, searching, and Excel export capabilities.  They also implement error handling and loading indicators.


## 1:24:12 PM
The log shows several code changes made on July 11, 2025, primarily focusing on the `Skribe-Frontend` application's social landing page and a social campaign insights page.

**`Hero.jsx` (src/components/BeforeLoginPages/SocialLanding/Hero.jsx):** This file underwent multiple revisions between 12:27 PM and 1:00 PM.  The main changes involved the header section, specifically the arrangement of "Get Early Access" and "Login" buttons. Initially, they were separate `Link` components; then they were grouped within a `div` with `gap-3` class; finally, they were styled as a flex items-center gap-3.  Also a `shadow-md bg-white` class was added to the header.  The rest of the Hero component, including images and text, remained largely consistent.

**`page.jsx` (src/app/(BeforeLoginPages)/choose-login/page.jsx):** This file experienced several quick changes between 12:28 PM and 12:30 PM, switching the component rendered from `Discover` to `Choose`.  This suggests an iterative process of selecting the correct component for the choose-login page.

**`CTASection.jsx` (src/components/BeforeLoginPages/SocialLanding/CTASection.jsx):** This file, modified between 12:31 PM and 12:50 PM, shows a significant evolution of a contact form.  The initial version had fields for name, email, and organization.  Subsequent updates added fields for organization type, mobile number, and password, along with radio buttons for selecting organization type (`Agency` or `Enterprise`), and the form's layout was adjusted from `space-y-4` to `space-y-6` and using `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4` class.  There were multiple commented-out versions of the code, possibly reflecting experimentation or rollbacks. The max-width of the form also changed several times between different commits.

**`SocialCampaignCreationPage.jsx` (src/app/(AfterLoginPages)/(socials)/social/insights/page.jsx):** This file was updated at 12:52 PM, simply importing and rendering the `Insights` component.

**`SocialLandingPage.jsx` (src/components/BeforeLoginPages/SocialLanding/SocialLandingPage.jsx):**  Updated at 12:53 PM, this file assembles the social landing page, incorporating `Hero`, `WhyThisProduct`, `UseCases`, `Testimonials`, `CTASection`, and `Footer` components.  The changes here reflect the component updates described above.

**`Insights.jsx` (src/components/Social/SocialComponents/Insights.jsx):** This file, modified at 12:54 PM, displays an influencer campaign dashboard. It features tables for "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers", along with a modal for adding deliverables.  The component uses hardcoded data for demonstration.

**Recurring elements:**  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is apparent throughout all the files. The color `#E96D70` (a shade of red) is repeatedly used for buttons.  The repeated inclusion of "Get Early Access" buttons across multiple components might indicate a need for better component reusability or a refactoring of the early access process.


## 2:06:22 PM
The log shows edits to two HTML files, `index.html` and `index3.html`, representing email newsletter templates.  The `index.html` file, representing a monthly newsletter, underwent several revisions between 1:07 PM and 1:18 PM on July 11, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved minor formatting adjustments and the removal of a table element towards the end of the HTML. The content remained largely consistent, focusing on Skribe's new features (Press Release Distribution and Regional Vernacular Tracking), a key industry event, and a "Journalist of the Month" highlight.


`index3.html`, a weekly newsletter template, shows modifications from 1:49 PM to 2:01 PM on the same day. The changes focused on improving responsiveness and styling.  Specific changes included the addition of CSS classes (`logo-image`, `content-responsive-image`) for better control over image sizing and responsiveness. The logo image's dimensions and styling were refined multiple times.  A media query was introduced to further optimize the logo for smaller screens. The overall content structure of the weekly newsletter remained consistent, showcasing blog posts, a call to action, and company information.  The consistent use of `clamp()` in CSS suggests an effort to ensure responsive design across different screen sizes.  The color scheme (#002B5B, #374151) is consistently used across both newsletter templates.


## 2:24:09 PM
The log shows two code changes within a short time frame on July 11, 2025.

The first change (1:26:43 PM) to `page.jsx` in the `choose-login` directory imports and renders a `Choose` component from another file, suggesting the creation or modification of a login choice page.

The second change (1:27:25 PM) to `Testimonials.jsx` within the `SocialLanding` component displays a carousel of three testimonials. Each testimonial includes a title, description, company, image, and a 5-star rating.  The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling and renders the testimonials in a grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.  The styling is consistent and utilizes a dark text on a light background.


## 3:06:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files, `index3.html` and `index.html`, representing email templates.  The changes primarily focus on styling and layout adjustments, with minor content modifications.

**`index3.html` (Weekly Newsletter):**

The file underwent several revisions between 2:10 PM and 3:06 PM on July 11, 2025.  The key changes involved:

* **Padding and margins adjustments:** Numerous updates altered padding and margin values around various elements (headings, paragraphs, tables, images) to refine the layout.  This suggests iterative improvements to spacing and visual appeal.
* **Horizontal rule replacement:** A `<div>` element simulating a horizontal rule was replaced with a `<hr>` element for improved semantic correctness.
* **Logo positioning and size adjustments:** Modifications to the logo's padding, and responsive resizing for mobile devices via media queries were made.
* **Heading size changes:** The main heading (`<h1>`) size was decreased from 48px to 34px, indicating a change in visual emphasis.
* **Text alignment:**  The main heading's text alignment changed from left to center.



**`index.html` (Monthly Newsletter):**

The file was revised between 2:36 PM and 2:59 PM on July 11, 2025. The major changes involved:

* **Font changes:** The initial version used Typekit's 'proxima-nova' and Google Fonts' 'Montserrat', while the final version retains only 'Montserrat' and Google Fonts.
* **Header image size adjustments:** The header background image size was modified, shifting from `cover` to `100% 100%` and eventually `100% 80%`.  This points to attempts to optimize the header's appearance and prevent distortion.
* **Heading size changes:** The main heading (`<h1>`) size was reduced from 38px to 30px.
* **Padding adjustments:** Padding values around the main content area were adjusted for better visual balance.
* **Table attributes:**  HTML table attributes like `border`, `cellpadding`, and `cellspacing` were added to improve semantic markup and styling.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

Both files extensively use HTML tables for layout, a common (though not always ideal) practice in email template design.  Both also utilize inline styles extensively, another common but potentially less maintainable characteristic of email templates.  Both include various calls-to-action (CTAs) linking to different sections of the `goskribe.com` platform.  Finally, both use horizontal lines (`<hr>` or `<div>` simulating it) to separate content sections. The consistent use of  `#002B5B` and `#374151` suggests a consistent brand color palette.


## 4:24:14 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Insights.jsx` on July 11, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: displaying engaged and shortlisted influencers, with the ability to add deliverables for engaged influencers via a popup.  The primary changes focus on styling and layout adjustments within the component.

Specifically, between 3:55 PM and 4:09 PM, there were several minor edits.  The most significant change involves the styling of the table.  Initially, the `DELIVERABLES` column's width wasn't explicitly set, causing layout issues. Subsequent commits adjusted the width using `max-w-[XXXpx]` and `w-[XXXpx]` to better control the column's size.  Additionally,  padding and styling of table cells (`td`) and table headers (`th`) were refined, with padding increasing in `py` values across several commits and the addition of a `cursor-pointer` style to the "Add Deliverables" button. Finally, a `bg-gradient` style was moved from the `tbody` to `th` elements in the table at 4:09:23 PM.

The data displayed (lists of engaged and shortlisted influencers) remains largely unchanged throughout the revisions, always featuring "Bhuvan Bam" as the example influencer. One commit at 4:08:36 PM added an extra entry to `shortlistedInfluencers`, highlighting a potential data entry or testing scenario.  The timestamps show a rapid iteration of minor styling changes within a short time frame (approximately 45 minutes).


## 5:24:12 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Insights.jsx` on July 11th, 2025.  The component renders a dashboard displaying engaged and shortlisted influencers for a campaign titled "Sparkles Chocolate Launch for Delhi Audience" (live on June 20th, 2025).

The primary changes revolve around the styling and layout of the UI, specifically the popup for adding deliverables.  There were no changes made to the core functionality or data handling.


* **4:43:07 PM:** Initial commit.  The component displays two tables: one for engaged influencers with "Add Deliverables" buttons, and another for shortlisted influencers with influencer data (followers, category, reach, views, engagement rate, status).  A popup modal appears when the "Add Deliverables" button is clicked, allowing input for deliverables details (link, type, duration, cost).

* **4:50:21 PM and 4:50:44 PM:**  Minor, likely inconsequential changes. These commits show no apparent code changes in the provided diff.


* **5:02:28 PM:**  The popup modal's structure is altered. The `p-6` class is removed from the popup, and padding was later added again.


* **5:02:47 PM:** A background color (`bg-[#F0EDE6]`) is added to the popup's header.


* **5:03:06 PM:** The background color is applied to the entire popup header (`rounded-t-[12px]`).


* **5:03:58 PM:** Padding (`p-2`) is added to the popup's content area.

* **5:05:35 PM and 5:05:48 PM:** The  padding (`p-2`) was added to the body of the popup and no functional changes.

In summary, the edits primarily focus on refining the visual presentation of the popup modal within the influencer dashboard component.  The core data structures and functionality remain unchanged across all revisions.  The data consistently shows placeholder information for Bhuvan Bam as the influencer.
