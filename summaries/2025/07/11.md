# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 11:10:35 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `AllAdmins.jsx` and `StudentsRegister.jsx`, both focused on displaying and managing data in a dashboard-like interface.  The changes made to `AllAdmins.jsx` between 1:08 AM and 1:18 AM appear to be minor formatting adjustments or possibly due to an IDE auto-formatting feature; the code content remains essentially the same across these revisions. This component displays a list of admins, allowing for searching, filtering by mode, pagination, and export to Excel.

The `StudentsRegister.jsx` component undergoes more substantial changes between 1:26 AM and 1:31 AM. Initially, the component shows a list of students with features for searching, filtering by status, sorting by name, email, or date of birth, pagination, selection for bulk deletion, and export to Excel. A significant update at 1:31 AM removes almost all the component's functionality, leaving behind only comments of the original code.  This suggests a complete rewrite or temporary removal of the component's functionality may have taken place.  Both components share a common pattern: they use React, data fetching (from APIs and stores), pagination, sorting, searching, and Excel export capabilities.  They also implement error handling and loading indicators.
