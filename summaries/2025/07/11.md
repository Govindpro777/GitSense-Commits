# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 11:10:35 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `AllAdmins.jsx` and `StudentsRegister.jsx`, both focused on displaying and managing data in a dashboard-like interface.  The changes made to `AllAdmins.jsx` between 1:08 AM and 1:18 AM appear to be minor formatting adjustments or possibly due to an IDE auto-formatting feature; the code content remains essentially the same across these revisions. This component displays a list of admins, allowing for searching, filtering by mode, pagination, and export to Excel.

The `StudentsRegister.jsx` component undergoes more substantial changes between 1:26 AM and 1:31 AM. Initially, the component shows a list of students with features for searching, filtering by status, sorting by name, email, or date of birth, pagination, selection for bulk deletion, and export to Excel. A significant update at 1:31 AM removes almost all the component's functionality, leaving behind only comments of the original code.  This suggests a complete rewrite or temporary removal of the component's functionality may have taken place.  Both components share a common pattern: they use React, data fetching (from APIs and stores), pagination, sorting, searching, and Excel export capabilities.  They also implement error handling and loading indicators.


## 1:24:12 PM
The log shows several code changes made on July 11, 2025, primarily focusing on the `Skribe-Frontend` application's social landing page and a social campaign insights page.

**`Hero.jsx` (src/components/BeforeLoginPages/SocialLanding/Hero.jsx):** This file underwent multiple revisions between 12:27 PM and 1:00 PM.  The main changes involved the header section, specifically the arrangement of "Get Early Access" and "Login" buttons. Initially, they were separate `Link` components; then they were grouped within a `div` with `gap-3` class; finally, they were styled as a flex items-center gap-3.  Also a `shadow-md bg-white` class was added to the header.  The rest of the Hero component, including images and text, remained largely consistent.

**`page.jsx` (src/app/(BeforeLoginPages)/choose-login/page.jsx):** This file experienced several quick changes between 12:28 PM and 12:30 PM, switching the component rendered from `Discover` to `Choose`.  This suggests an iterative process of selecting the correct component for the choose-login page.

**`CTASection.jsx` (src/components/BeforeLoginPages/SocialLanding/CTASection.jsx):** This file, modified between 12:31 PM and 12:50 PM, shows a significant evolution of a contact form.  The initial version had fields for name, email, and organization.  Subsequent updates added fields for organization type, mobile number, and password, along with radio buttons for selecting organization type (`Agency` or `Enterprise`), and the form's layout was adjusted from `space-y-4` to `space-y-6` and using `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4` class.  There were multiple commented-out versions of the code, possibly reflecting experimentation or rollbacks. The max-width of the form also changed several times between different commits.

**`SocialCampaignCreationPage.jsx` (src/app/(AfterLoginPages)/(socials)/social/insights/page.jsx):** This file was updated at 12:52 PM, simply importing and rendering the `Insights` component.

**`SocialLandingPage.jsx` (src/components/BeforeLoginPages/SocialLanding/SocialLandingPage.jsx):**  Updated at 12:53 PM, this file assembles the social landing page, incorporating `Hero`, `WhyThisProduct`, `UseCases`, `Testimonials`, `CTASection`, and `Footer` components.  The changes here reflect the component updates described above.

**`Insights.jsx` (src/components/Social/SocialComponents/Insights.jsx):** This file, modified at 12:54 PM, displays an influencer campaign dashboard. It features tables for "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers", along with a modal for adding deliverables.  The component uses hardcoded data for demonstration.

**Recurring elements:**  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is apparent throughout all the files. The color `#E96D70` (a shade of red) is repeatedly used for buttons.  The repeated inclusion of "Get Early Access" buttons across multiple components might indicate a need for better component reusability or a refactoring of the early access process.
