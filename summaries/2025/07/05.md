# Activity Summary for 7/5/2025

## 3:49:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `src\app\(BeforeLoginPages)\blog\[id]\page.jsx` between 3:21 PM and 3:47 PM on July 5th, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is refining how the `id` or `slug` parameter is accessed and passed to the `BlogDetail` component.

Initially, the code attempts to destructure and process the `params` object in different ways, experimenting with `await params`, array destructuring (`[id] = slug`), and direct access (`{ id } = params`). There's a brief period where a separate `BureauChiefPage` component is present, showing a different data structure for parameters.  Several revisions revert back to simpler approaches, reflecting potential debugging or experimentation.

Between 3:28 PM and 3:29 PM, the code stabilizes on a straightforward method of accessing the `id` directly from the `params` object. At 3:37 PM, there's a significant change where the component's parameter handling is modified.  Instead of directly accessing `params.id`, it receives `params` as props and retrieves `params.id` within the function. Finally, at 3:47 PM, the `slug` parameter from `params` is used instead of `id`.  The code comments out the previous version before the last change.

The recurring theme throughout these revisions is consistently handling parameters to correctly pass them to the `BlogDetail` component, although the name of the imported component changed from `BlogDetails` to `BlogDetail` at the final revision.  The instability in the parameter handling might indicate a problem with the data structure received in the `params` object and subsequent attempts to correct this.
