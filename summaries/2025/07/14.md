# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

## 12:17:33 AM
The log shows two revisions of `Insights.jsx` on July 13th, 2025.  The changes between the revisions are minimal.  Both revisions display a dashboard for managing influencer campaigns, featuring tables for "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers".  The data displayed includes influencer name, username, verification status, follower count, category, estimated reach, average views, average engagement rate, and status.  A popup form allows adding deliverables for selected influencers, with fields for link, type, duration, and cost.

The first revision (11:55:55 PM) and the second revision (11:56:07 PM) are nearly identical. The only difference is within the popup's "Add Button" section in the second revision, a `gap-2` class has been added to the div containing the "Add" and "Done" buttons. This minor change improves spacing between these buttons.  The component uses a consistent styling throughout, employing tailwind CSS classes for layout and styling.  Both versions show hardcoded data for Bhuvan Bam as the only influencer, indicating that the component is likely still under development and the data is placeholder.


## 9:07:29 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two main files: `Insights.jsx` and `Stats.jsx`.

**`Insights.jsx`:**  This component underwent significant changes between 12:57:16 AM and 12:57:38 AM.  The initial version was heavily commented out, suggesting it was a work in progress. The final version of this time range shows a React component rendering a dashboard displaying engaged and shortlisted influencers for a campaign ("Sparkles Chocolate Launch for Delhi Audience").  The component includes interactive elements such as buttons to add deliverables and influencers, and displays influencer data in tables.  There was another heavily commented out version at 12:57:54 AM. The changes between the commented and uncommented versions seem to be related to adding a popup modal for adding deliverables.  The data used (e.g., influencer names, followers) is placeholder data.

**`Stats.jsx`:** This component, displaying campaign statistics, shows a series of minor revisions between 1:11:33 AM and 7:33:54 AM. The initial version shows a component that renders pie and line charts using `react-apexcharts`, along with several statistic cards and a table of content details. The subsequent revisions primarily focus on styling improvements, mainly adjustments to the colors and background gradients used in the UI elements.  Specifically, the color schemes of the cards and table headers  were repeatedly refined, shifting from shades of green to more vibrant gradients. The table styling changes were incremental, adding and adjusting the background and border properties of table elements over several commits.  The core functionality and data remain consistent.  The addition of `"use client";` at the start of the file is significant at 7:18:44 AM as it indicates a change that enables the component to use client-side React features.
