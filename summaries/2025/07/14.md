# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

## 12:17:33 AM
The log shows two revisions of `Insights.jsx` on July 13th, 2025.  The changes between the revisions are minimal.  Both revisions display a dashboard for managing influencer campaigns, featuring tables for "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers".  The data displayed includes influencer name, username, verification status, follower count, category, estimated reach, average views, average engagement rate, and status.  A popup form allows adding deliverables for selected influencers, with fields for link, type, duration, and cost.

The first revision (11:55:55 PM) and the second revision (11:56:07 PM) are nearly identical. The only difference is within the popup's "Add Button" section in the second revision, a `gap-2` class has been added to the div containing the "Add" and "Done" buttons. This minor change improves spacing between these buttons.  The component uses a consistent styling throughout, employing tailwind CSS classes for layout and styling.  Both versions show hardcoded data for Bhuvan Bam as the only influencer, indicating that the component is likely still under development and the data is placeholder.
