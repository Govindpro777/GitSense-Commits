# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

## 12:17:33 AM
The log shows two revisions of `Insights.jsx` on July 13th, 2025.  The changes between the revisions are minimal.  Both revisions display a dashboard for managing influencer campaigns, featuring tables for "Engaged Influencers" and "Shortlisted Influencers".  The data displayed includes influencer name, username, verification status, follower count, category, estimated reach, average views, average engagement rate, and status.  A popup form allows adding deliverables for selected influencers, with fields for link, type, duration, and cost.

The first revision (11:55:55 PM) and the second revision (11:56:07 PM) are nearly identical. The only difference is within the popup's "Add Button" section in the second revision, a `gap-2` class has been added to the div containing the "Add" and "Done" buttons. This minor change improves spacing between these buttons.  The component uses a consistent styling throughout, employing tailwind CSS classes for layout and styling.  Both versions show hardcoded data for Bhuvan Bam as the only influencer, indicating that the component is likely still under development and the data is placeholder.


## 9:07:29 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two main files: `Insights.jsx` and `Stats.jsx`.

**`Insights.jsx`:**  This component underwent significant changes between 12:57:16 AM and 12:57:38 AM.  The initial version was heavily commented out, suggesting it was a work in progress. The final version of this time range shows a React component rendering a dashboard displaying engaged and shortlisted influencers for a campaign ("Sparkles Chocolate Launch for Delhi Audience").  The component includes interactive elements such as buttons to add deliverables and influencers, and displays influencer data in tables.  There was another heavily commented out version at 12:57:54 AM. The changes between the commented and uncommented versions seem to be related to adding a popup modal for adding deliverables.  The data used (e.g., influencer names, followers) is placeholder data.

**`Stats.jsx`:** This component, displaying campaign statistics, shows a series of minor revisions between 1:11:33 AM and 7:33:54 AM. The initial version shows a component that renders pie and line charts using `react-apexcharts`, along with several statistic cards and a table of content details. The subsequent revisions primarily focus on styling improvements, mainly adjustments to the colors and background gradients used in the UI elements.  Specifically, the color schemes of the cards and table headers  were repeatedly refined, shifting from shades of green to more vibrant gradients. The table styling changes were incremental, adding and adjusting the background and border properties of table elements over several commits.  The core functionality and data remain consistent.  The addition of `"use client";` at the start of the file is significant at 7:18:44 AM as it indicates a change that enables the component to use client-side React features.


## 10:07:33 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `Stats.jsx` and `Insights.jsx`.  The changes span a period between 9:20 AM and 9:52 AM on July 14, 2025.

**`Stats.jsx` (7/14/2025):** This component displays various social media statistics.  The initial version at 9:20:04 AM included pie and line charts using `react-apexcharts`, along with a table showing data for individual content pieces (e.g., views, likes, engagement rate). Later revisions at 9:54:06 AM and 9:54:17 AM involved minor UI adjustments, adding a `max-w-7xl` wrapper and changing the outer div's class to include `items-center`. A final revision at 9:54:42 AM removed the `items-center` class.


**`Insights.jsx` (7/14/2025):** This component, focused on influencer campaign insights, underwent more extensive changes.  The first version (9:33:05 AM) presented engaged and shortlisted influencers in separate tables.  A modal for adding deliverables was also present.

Subsequent changes between 9:33:21 AM and 9:35:34 AM mainly involved refinements to the styling and structure of the tables, specifically adjustments to column widths and the addition of border styles.

A significant change occurred at 9:35:06 AM, where the table columns for engaged influencers were adjusted to include "Total Cost" and "Actions" columns. The "Actions" column provided an "Insights" button.

Further modifications at 9:46:30 AM simplified the "Actions" column, removing one of the "Add Deliverables" buttons. Another update at 9:47:40 AM completely removed the button from the Actions column.

The final version at 9:50:25 AM and 9:52:00 AM added the `FiEye` icon from `react-icons/fi` to the "Actions" column, making the "Insights" label a `span` element. At 9:52:11 AM, the `flex` class and `gap-2` were added to the icon and text in the "Actions" column for better spacing.

Throughout the modifications of `Insights.jsx`, the data for engaged and shortlisted influencers (`engagedInfluencers` and `shortlistedInfluencers` state variables) remained mostly consistent, primarily showcasing data for "Bhuvan Bam".  The code consistently uses a Tailwind CSS-like styling approach.


## 11:07:23 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Insights.jsx` and one revision to `Stats.jsx` on July 14, 2025.

**`Insights.jsx` Changes:**

The `Insights.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 10:10 AM and 10:21 AM.  These revisions primarily focused on styling and layout adjustments within the component's tables and UI elements.  No significant functional changes are apparent in the code snippets; the core logic of displaying engaged and shortlisted influencers remains consistent.  Specific changes include:

* **10:10:51 AM:** Initial version showing engaged and shortlisted influencers in separate tables,  an "Add Deliverables" button, and a popup for adding deliverables.  The tables' styling is consistent but not perfectly aligned.

* **10:11:04 AM - 10:11:56 AM:** Minor styling tweaks in the tables.  Specifically, the width of the "TOTAL COST" and "ACTIONS" columns in the "Engaged Influencers" table was adjusted in subsequent commits.  The `text-left` alignment in the "ACTIONS" column header of the "Engaged Influencers" table was changed to `text-center`.

* **10:12:35 AM:**  Further refinement of table styling. The `TOTAL COST` and `ACTIONS` columns in the "Engaged Influencers" table had their alignment changed to `text-center`.  The styling was consistently applied to make the table more visually appealing and aligned.

* **10:20:35 AM - 10:21:00 AM:**  Final styling adjustments.  The alignment of the "Insights" text within the "Actions" column of the "Engaged Influencers" table was changed from left to center using `justify-center` in the flexbox.


**`Stats.jsx` Changes:**

* **10:22:53 AM - 10:24:33 AM:** A single revision to `Stats.jsx` that modifies the `pieChartOptions` to change the legend's marker shape from a square to a rectangle by setting the width and height of the markers to 3px and radius to 0 in the legend settings.  This is a minor visual adjustment to the legend in the pie chart.


## 11:35:20 AM
The primary change on July 14, 2025, at 11:01:42 AM, involved the `api.ts` file within the `Skribe-Backend` project.  This file contains Axios configuration for handling API requests.  The update focuses heavily on implementing refresh token functionality for authentication.  The code includes interceptors to handle requests and responses. On the request side, it adds authorization headers with access tokens.  The response interceptor manages 401 (Unauthorized) errors by attempting a refresh token request to `/Authenticate/refresh-token`. If the refresh is successful, the original request is retried. If the refresh fails or network errors occur, appropriate alerts are displayed (using a custom `Alert` component), and the user is redirected to the login page (`/`).  The code also features multiple commented-out base URLs, suggesting experimentation with different deployment environments (localhost, beta, and production).  The use of `Alert.success` for error messages is a noteworthy stylistic choice.  The logic for handling concurrent refresh token requests (`isRefreshing` and `refreshAccessTokenPromise`) prevents race conditions.


## 12:07:31 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Stats.jsx`, a React component displaying social media statistics.  The primary focus of the changes is on styling and configuration of charts and tables.

Between 11:10:34 AM and 11:14:52 AM, the component underwent several iterations. Initially, it included both a pie chart and a line chart using `ReactApexChart`.  A commented-out section of the code shows the initial line chart configuration.  The line chart was then modified, with the most significant change at 11:10:57 AM: data point markers were hidden (`markers: { size: 0, }`). Later, at 11:11:42 AM,  the `Chart` component from `react-apexcharts` was briefly introduced before being reverted  at 11:12:38 AM to exclusively use `ReactApexChart` again. Subsequently, at 11:13:23 AM, a single data point was altered in `lineChartData`, and at 11:14:52 AM, the line chart's curve style was changed from "smooth" to "straight".

At 11:28:39 AM and 11:29:15 AM, custom square markers were added to the pie chart legend, showcasing custom SVG implementation.  The fill color of the SVG was adjusted from `#8B5CF6` to `#ccc` between these timestamps.

From 11:35:43 AM to 11:38:47 AM, some commented-out code was removed, simplifying the `pieChartOptions`.  The significant change here (11:38:47 AM) is that the pie chart legend markers were changed to square shapes with no rounded corners.

Finally, between 11:45:51 AM and 11:47:52 AM, borders were added to table cells and the table itself. This is reflected in the addition of the `border` and `border-r` classes in the table's HTML structure. The line chart remained largely unchanged, and at 12:01:04 PM the line chart was commented out, leaving only the pie chart.  Throughout all revisions, the data displayed ( `pieChartData`, `lineChartData`, `statsData`, `tableData`) remained largely consistent, with only minor data point adjustments in the line chart's data.


## 1:26:36 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `Stats.jsx` component between 12:29 PM and 1:26 PM on July 14, 2025.  The component displays various statistics, including a pie chart and a line chart using the `react-apexcharts` library.  Multiple revisions focused on styling and visual adjustments to the charts and tables.  There were several small updates to the styling and font properties of  the charts and tables. The `lineChartOptions`  were significantly altered, notably modifications to the axis appearance (adding/removing borders, ticks, and grid lines), marker styling (shape and size), and color changes. The  most substantial changes occurred  around 12:40 PM with multiple consecutive edits making visual changes to the display, such as font size and weight alterations, as well as color scheme refinement. Between 12:55 PM and 1:04 PM, the `Stats.jsx` component was completely commented out, suggesting a potential temporary removal or a complete rewrite. Finally the code was restored with a few modifications to colors and the grid.

The `CTASection.jsx` component was updated twice within a short timeframe (12:31 PM and 12:32 PM). These changes involved primarily removing the styling `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-red-400 focus:border-transparent` from the input fields.  A section of radio buttons was commented out in both versions.

A new file `page.jsx` was created at 12:36 PM, importing and rendering a `Choose` component likely for a login selection page.

The `Insights.jsx` component saw several updates between 1:07 PM and 1:17 PM. The changes focused mainly on styling and layout adjustments for tables displaying influencer data.  The most noticeable change was the consistent addition of `text-center` to data cells in the tables at approximately 1:11 PM, ensuring data is centered within columns.  Further refinements to the styling continued until the final version at 1:17 PM.  The component uses  `react-icons/fi` for icons and includes a state management for a popup, likely for adding deliverables related to influencers.


## 3:26:33 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `Stats.jsx` between 1:31 PM and 2:12 PM on July 14, 2025, focusing primarily on styling and layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  The changes involve tweaking the appearance of charts and tables, including modifying colors, font sizes, and spacing.  Specific changes include adjustments to `pieChartOptions` (legend marker size, spacing, and color) and `lineChartOptions` (yaxis tickAmount). There's also consistent modification of heading sizes (`h3` tags) and text color within the component.  Between 2:29 PM and 2:58 PM, `BlogDetails.jsx` underwent several revisions.  The major changes included adjusting heading sizes, adding/removing an author avatar image, and updating text colors.  Finally, `SocialLandingPage.jsx` and `Hero.jsx` were modified between 3:05 PM and 3:13 PM.  These modifications implemented smooth scrolling functionality to the CTA section and added a `cursor-pointer` class to the `Get Early Access` button in `Hero.jsx`.  The `CTASection.jsx` component was also modified between 3:05PM and 3:12PM, where the only change was adding `ref` prop to the component for smooth scroll functionality.  The `Insights.jsx` component saw changes between 3:17PM and 3:20PM adding a new function `handleEngageOfline` and adjusting the styling of certain components.  The `handleEngageOfline` function appears to be for adding the engaged offline functionality, while the stylistic changes were minor changes to colors and alignment.  No significant logic changes are observed in the code across the log entries.


## 4:26:32 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `Insights.jsx` component between 3:27 PM and 4:25 PM on July 14, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the implementation of a dropdown component for selecting a campaign within the "Engaged Offline?" functionality.

Initially, the `Insights.jsx` component contained commented-out code and hardcoded data for engaged and shortlisted influencers.  Over the course of several edits, the component was progressively improved:

* **3:27 PM:** The initial commit shows a basic table structure with hardcoded data for engaged and shortlisted influencers. The UI is largely functional but lacks features like dynamic data fetching and a campaign selection dropdown.

* **3:29 PM - 3:33 PM:** Several commits introduce state management using `useState` for popup controls (`isPopupOpen`, `isEngagePopupOpen`) and a `selectedInfluencer`. The hardcoded influencer data remains largely the same, though some minor variations and reductions in the number of hardcoded entries are visible.  The primary change in this phase is replacing image placeholders with styled divs as placeholders.

* **3:36 PM - 3:59 PM:** Significant changes are made to introduce the campaign selection functionality. A `selectedOption` state variable and a `handleEngageOffline` function are added, which logs the selected option to the console. The `handleEngageOffline` function is renamed to `handleOffline`. The campaign selection data is initially hardcoded within the `handleEngageOffline` function, then refactored into a select dropdown.  Further refinements to the UI for the select component, including styling and placeholder text modifications, are also observed.

* **4:00 PM - 4:15 PM:** A more complex dropdown is implemented.  The code introduces a `dropdownData` array with nested "categories" and "subcategories".  State variables (`isDropdownOpen`, `expandedCategories`) handle dropdown expansion and selection.  The component now uses `react-icons/fa` to add icons (chevron, bullseye). The select box is styled to include a placeholder, and the UI is improved to use images again in place of divs.

* **4:20 PM - 4:25 PM:** During this time, there were changes to a separate file, `SocialSummary.jsx`. This suggests that the focus might have shifted temporarily to another component before returning to further refine `Insights.jsx` This suggests that the development might have been interleaved between different components.

* **4:23 PM - 4:25 PM:**  The final changes focus on stylistic refinements and minor improvements to the dropdown's visual appeal and function. The `dropdownData` is updated slightly, with some label changes.  The `text-gray-700` was changed to `text-gray-900` to enhance readability. The font-size was adjusted within the dropdown component to improve presentation.

The overall pattern demonstrates a clear iterative development process. The component starts with a rudimentary structure and gradually adds features and styling through multiple commits.  The final version is significantly more sophisticated than the initial one.


## 5:26:25 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `SocialSummary.jsx` between 4:31 PM and 5:25 PM on July 14, 2025.  All changes are commented-out code, suggesting that the developer was experimenting with different approaches or temporarily disabling sections of the component. There were no substantive changes to the functionality.  The `Insights.jsx` file also received several updates during this period (between 4:40 PM and 5:03 PM), focusing on refinements to the UI, specifically a dropdown menu for campaign selection.  The changes in `Insights.jsx` involved improvements to the styling and functionality of a dropdown menu and its associated elements, and alterations to the text content within the dropdown options.  The  `campaign_listing` value in the `dropdownData` array was corrected. There was also a minor wording adjustment in the `getSelectedLabel()` function.  No significant functional changes were made to this component either.


## 11:19:56 PM
The log shows multiple updates to React components within a Next.js application, specifically focusing on social media campaign management.  Several files were modified throughout the day on July 14th, 2025.

`SocialSummary.jsx` underwent several revisions between 5:27 PM and 5:37 PM.  The component appears to display a summary of social media campaigns, including filtering and pagination.  Changes primarily involve commenting out or uncommenting large sections of code, suggesting iterative development and potential debugging or refactoring. The core functionality, including fetching campaign data (`getAllCampaignData`), filtering by status and dates, and implementing infinite scrolling, remained consistent across these revisions.  The commented-out code indicates features for searching, creating campaigns, and deleting campaigns.

`Insights.jsx` was updated three times between 5:31 PM and 10:33 PM. This component seems to display influencer campaign insights, showing engaged and shortlisted influencers with associated data such as followers, reach, and engagement rates.  One significant change involved modifying the font weight in a dropdown component (from `font-[600]` to `font-[500]`) and removing some elements from the `dropdownData` array.  The later changes at 10:33 PM included adding table headings to the engaged influencers table.

`Stats.jsx` was updated twice between 10:28 PM and 10:30 PM. This component displays campaign statistics using charts and tables provided by `ReactApexChart`. The changes appear minor, involving adjustments to the styling and alignment of table cells within the table.  The core chart and data representation remained unchanged.

In general, the changes throughout the day demonstrate a focus on improving UI elements, data presentation, and possibly bug fixes.  There’s no discernible overarching pattern beyond iterative improvements to the three components involved in displaying social media campaign data.
