# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 12:59:10 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to three React component files between 12:28 AM and 12:55 AM on July 1st, 2025.

`SocialSummary.jsx`: This file, updated at 12:28:16 AM,  is a component displaying a summary of social media campaigns. It features filtering (by search term, status, and date range),  a table showing campaign details (name, creators, budget, status, etc.), and a button to create new campaigns. The table dynamically updates based on the applied filters.  The status is color-coded (Sent: green, Draft: yellow, Scheduled: red).

`EmailPreview.jsx`: This component underwent several revisions (12:28:58 AM, 12:33:19 AM, 12:33:55 AM, 12:39:26 AM, 12:39:47 AM, and 12:50:04 AM).  The core functionality involves displaying and editing email previews for campaigns. Initially, it was fully commented out, indicating a potential starting point.  Subsequent changes show the addition of functionality to fetch draft data from a backend service (`userService.get`), dynamically generate email content based on fetched data (including a deliverable table), and allow for editing of the email content.  A significant change around 12:39 AM introduced the ability to parse and update email sections (greeting, introduction, etc.) based on user input in a textarea. Finally the file was commented out again at 12:50 AM and 12:55 AM. There is also the handling of attachments, allowing adding and removing them from the draft email.

`Shortlist.jsx`: This file, with updates at 12:52:19 AM, 12:52:51 AM, 12:53:06 AM, and 12:55:36 AM, contains a component for shortlisting creators.  It's fully commented out in all entries, suggesting it was either in development or temporarily disabled during the logged period. The commented-out code suggests functionality for fetching creator data, filtering (search, verification status, contact information), selecting creators for engagement, and updating campaign data on the backend.  The component uses Next.js's navigation hooks (`usePathname`, `useSearchParams`, `useRouter`) for URL management and updating the URL based on filtering and selection changes.
