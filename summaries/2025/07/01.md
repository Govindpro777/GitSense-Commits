# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 12:59:10 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to three React component files between 12:28 AM and 12:55 AM on July 1st, 2025.

`SocialSummary.jsx`: This file, updated at 12:28:16 AM,  is a component displaying a summary of social media campaigns. It features filtering (by search term, status, and date range),  a table showing campaign details (name, creators, budget, status, etc.), and a button to create new campaigns. The table dynamically updates based on the applied filters.  The status is color-coded (Sent: green, Draft: yellow, Scheduled: red).

`EmailPreview.jsx`: This component underwent several revisions (12:28:58 AM, 12:33:19 AM, 12:33:55 AM, 12:39:26 AM, 12:39:47 AM, and 12:50:04 AM).  The core functionality involves displaying and editing email previews for campaigns. Initially, it was fully commented out, indicating a potential starting point.  Subsequent changes show the addition of functionality to fetch draft data from a backend service (`userService.get`), dynamically generate email content based on fetched data (including a deliverable table), and allow for editing of the email content.  A significant change around 12:39 AM introduced the ability to parse and update email sections (greeting, introduction, etc.) based on user input in a textarea. Finally the file was commented out again at 12:50 AM and 12:55 AM. There is also the handling of attachments, allowing adding and removing them from the draft email.

`Shortlist.jsx`: This file, with updates at 12:52:19 AM, 12:52:51 AM, 12:53:06 AM, and 12:55:36 AM, contains a component for shortlisting creators.  It's fully commented out in all entries, suggesting it was either in development or temporarily disabled during the logged period. The commented-out code suggests functionality for fetching creator data, filtering (search, verification status, contact information), selecting creators for engagement, and updating campaign data on the backend.  The component uses Next.js's navigation hooks (`usePathname`, `useSearchParams`, `useRouter`) for URL management and updating the URL based on filtering and selection changes.


## 9:52:15 AM
The log shows updates to two React components: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`.  `EmailPreview.jsx` underwent multiple revisions between 9:37 AM and 9:50 AM on July 1st, 2025, with no substantive changes in the code itself during those revisions. The component handles the preview of an email, fetching draft data using a `userService` and `GET_DRAFT_DATA` constant. It dynamically generates email content based on this draft data, allowing for editing and updates to different sections (greeting, introduction, call to action, etc.).  The code includes functions to generate a table of deliverables and to parse user-edited content to update the email's different sections. A loading indicator is displayed while fetching data.

The `EmailContent.jsx` component, updated at 9:51 AM on July 1st, 2025, focuses on rendering the formatted email content.  This update introduces a "Protected" indicator to table elements, visually distinguishing them as non-editable within the email preview. The component handles different formatting elements such as bold text, bullet points, italics, and tables, rendering them appropriately using React elements.  The addition of the "Protected" label suggests a change in functionality, likely to prevent editing of certain parts of the email content.


## 9:52:19 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `BrandReport.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`.  The changes span several hours on July 1st, 2025.

`BrandReport.tsx`: This file underwent multiple revisions between 1:13 AM and 8:58 AM. The core functionality involves generating and sending PDF reports.  Early revisions show experimentation with different PDF generation approaches (using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`), with a final version settling on a method that divides long sections into multiple pages for better handling of larger reports.  A significant change around 1:14 AM involved adding another API call within the `fetchAllApis` function, likely to fetch additional data (`/BrandMention` endpoint). This API call was later removed in a subsequent commit at 8:58 AM.  The file consistently uses the `userService` for API interactions and `Alert` for displaying messages. The final version includes functionality to send a PDF report via email using a POST request (`/send-client-report`).


`BrandSummary.tsx`: This component focuses on displaying report summaries using charts.  It was modified between 9:00 AM and 9:27 AM. The changes primarily involved refactoring and commenting out the entire component. The initial versions show the use of `ReactApexChart` to render bar and donut charts visualizing data related to top publications, journalists, sentiment scores, and regional mentions.  Data transformation functions (`transformPublicationsData`, `transformJournalistsData`, `transformRegionalData`) process backend responses and handle data manipulation for charting purposes. The component incorporates dummy data for fallback and utilizes a function (`shortenOutletName`) to shorten publication names. Finally, the component was entirely commented out in the last revision.


## 10:52:17 AM
The log shows several code modifications across two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`.  The changes span a short time period on July 1st, 2025, between approximately 9:53 AM and 10:03 AM.

**`EmailPreview.jsx` Changes:**

The initial version of `EmailPreview.jsx` (9:53 AM) contained a large, heavily commented-out section of code suggesting an earlier, more complex implementation.  The later version (10:03 AM) is significantly streamlined.  Key improvements include:

* **Simplified Email Content Generation:** The initial version had complex logic to parse and reconstruct the email content from a text area. The revised version uses `generateInitialEmailContent` to create the initial email content from `draftData`, and `restoreOriginalTable` to intelligently handle the table updates and reverts to the original table if the user cancels edits.
* **Improved Table Handling:** The deliverable table generation is improved to handle cases where no deliverables are defined and more efficiently integrates with the email content editing.  The original table is stored to enable restoration.
* **Enhanced User Experience:** The editing experience is cleaner with a dedicated textarea for editing and the use of a component (`EmailContent`) for rendering formatted content.  Attachments can now be removed individually, and the "Save Preview" / "Edit Preview" button is directly linked to the editing and saving process.
* **Error Handling:** The component now gracefully handles the case where `draftData` fails to load, displaying a clear error message.

**`Shortlist.jsx` Changes:**

Two entries for `Shortlist.jsx` exist in the log; a minor modification between 10:00 AM and 10:02 AM. The changes are subtle:  

* **Table Headings Modification:** The `tableHeadings` array, which defines column headers in the UI, was modified. Some column headers were renamed or reordered,  suggesting a refinement of the UI to present creator data.


Overall, the code changes reflect iterative development.  `EmailPreview.jsx` underwent a substantial refactor, while `Shortlist.jsx` received minor updates focused on UI refinement. The consistent use of the `userService` for API calls and the `GET_DRAFT_DATA` constant highlight a consistent backend interaction pattern.  The timestamps indicate focused development within a short time window.


## 12:52:26 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `BrandSummary.tsx` and `BrandReport.tsx`.  `BrandSummary.tsx` underwent numerous revisions between 10:20 AM and 11:41 AM,  with no substantive changes to the code detected in the diffs. The file appears to be a React component responsible for displaying brand summaries, likely using charts to visualize data.  The code includes functions to transform data (publications, journalists, regional mentions) for chart display. There's a use of dummy data, suggesting the component is designed to handle cases where real data is unavailable.

`BrandReport.tsx` was updated twice, at 10:47 AM and 11:55 AM. The first update involved adding a PDF generation function using `jspdf` and `html2canvas` libraries. The second update added a new API call for brand mentions to `fetchAllApis`, incorporated this new data into the state (`brandMention`, and  significantly expanded the  `handleSendReportAll` function to enable sending multiple reports via email.  The changes in `BrandReport.tsx` seem to focus on improving the report generation and email sending functionalities, including handling multiple recipients and providing feedback on success/failure.  The final update at 12:17 PM shows modifications to date calculation within `calculateDateRange` to use `Date` object methods instead of string manipulation and added logging for debugging purposes within `fetchAllApis`.  The `handleSendReportAll` function was refactored to improve clarity and error handling.  A significant change was removing the commented-out previous implementation of the `downloadPDF` function in favor of the improved version.  Further,  in `Narratives.tsx` multiple revisions between 11:13 AM and 12:37 PM occurred with changes in conditional rendering for mentioned outlets and streamlining of code without significant functional changes.
