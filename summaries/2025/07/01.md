# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 12:59:10 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to three React component files between 12:28 AM and 12:55 AM on July 1st, 2025.

`SocialSummary.jsx`: This file, updated at 12:28:16 AM,  is a component displaying a summary of social media campaigns. It features filtering (by search term, status, and date range),  a table showing campaign details (name, creators, budget, status, etc.), and a button to create new campaigns. The table dynamically updates based on the applied filters.  The status is color-coded (Sent: green, Draft: yellow, Scheduled: red).

`EmailPreview.jsx`: This component underwent several revisions (12:28:58 AM, 12:33:19 AM, 12:33:55 AM, 12:39:26 AM, 12:39:47 AM, and 12:50:04 AM).  The core functionality involves displaying and editing email previews for campaigns. Initially, it was fully commented out, indicating a potential starting point.  Subsequent changes show the addition of functionality to fetch draft data from a backend service (`userService.get`), dynamically generate email content based on fetched data (including a deliverable table), and allow for editing of the email content.  A significant change around 12:39 AM introduced the ability to parse and update email sections (greeting, introduction, etc.) based on user input in a textarea. Finally the file was commented out again at 12:50 AM and 12:55 AM. There is also the handling of attachments, allowing adding and removing them from the draft email.

`Shortlist.jsx`: This file, with updates at 12:52:19 AM, 12:52:51 AM, 12:53:06 AM, and 12:55:36 AM, contains a component for shortlisting creators.  It's fully commented out in all entries, suggesting it was either in development or temporarily disabled during the logged period. The commented-out code suggests functionality for fetching creator data, filtering (search, verification status, contact information), selecting creators for engagement, and updating campaign data on the backend.  The component uses Next.js's navigation hooks (`usePathname`, `useSearchParams`, `useRouter`) for URL management and updating the URL based on filtering and selection changes.


## 9:52:15 AM
The log shows updates to two React components: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`.  `EmailPreview.jsx` underwent multiple revisions between 9:37 AM and 9:50 AM on July 1st, 2025, with no substantive changes in the code itself during those revisions. The component handles the preview of an email, fetching draft data using a `userService` and `GET_DRAFT_DATA` constant. It dynamically generates email content based on this draft data, allowing for editing and updates to different sections (greeting, introduction, call to action, etc.).  The code includes functions to generate a table of deliverables and to parse user-edited content to update the email's different sections. A loading indicator is displayed while fetching data.

The `EmailContent.jsx` component, updated at 9:51 AM on July 1st, 2025, focuses on rendering the formatted email content.  This update introduces a "Protected" indicator to table elements, visually distinguishing them as non-editable within the email preview. The component handles different formatting elements such as bold text, bullet points, italics, and tables, rendering them appropriately using React elements.  The addition of the "Protected" label suggests a change in functionality, likely to prevent editing of certain parts of the email content.


## 9:52:19 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `BrandReport.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`.  The changes span several hours on July 1st, 2025.

`BrandReport.tsx`: This file underwent multiple revisions between 1:13 AM and 8:58 AM. The core functionality involves generating and sending PDF reports.  Early revisions show experimentation with different PDF generation approaches (using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`), with a final version settling on a method that divides long sections into multiple pages for better handling of larger reports.  A significant change around 1:14 AM involved adding another API call within the `fetchAllApis` function, likely to fetch additional data (`/BrandMention` endpoint). This API call was later removed in a subsequent commit at 8:58 AM.  The file consistently uses the `userService` for API interactions and `Alert` for displaying messages. The final version includes functionality to send a PDF report via email using a POST request (`/send-client-report`).


`BrandSummary.tsx`: This component focuses on displaying report summaries using charts.  It was modified between 9:00 AM and 9:27 AM. The changes primarily involved refactoring and commenting out the entire component. The initial versions show the use of `ReactApexChart` to render bar and donut charts visualizing data related to top publications, journalists, sentiment scores, and regional mentions.  Data transformation functions (`transformPublicationsData`, `transformJournalistsData`, `transformRegionalData`) process backend responses and handle data manipulation for charting purposes. The component incorporates dummy data for fallback and utilizes a function (`shortenOutletName`) to shorten publication names. Finally, the component was entirely commented out in the last revision.


## 10:52:17 AM
The log shows several code modifications across two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`.  The changes span a short time period on July 1st, 2025, between approximately 9:53 AM and 10:03 AM.

**`EmailPreview.jsx` Changes:**

The initial version of `EmailPreview.jsx` (9:53 AM) contained a large, heavily commented-out section of code suggesting an earlier, more complex implementation.  The later version (10:03 AM) is significantly streamlined.  Key improvements include:

* **Simplified Email Content Generation:** The initial version had complex logic to parse and reconstruct the email content from a text area. The revised version uses `generateInitialEmailContent` to create the initial email content from `draftData`, and `restoreOriginalTable` to intelligently handle the table updates and reverts to the original table if the user cancels edits.
* **Improved Table Handling:** The deliverable table generation is improved to handle cases where no deliverables are defined and more efficiently integrates with the email content editing.  The original table is stored to enable restoration.
* **Enhanced User Experience:** The editing experience is cleaner with a dedicated textarea for editing and the use of a component (`EmailContent`) for rendering formatted content.  Attachments can now be removed individually, and the "Save Preview" / "Edit Preview" button is directly linked to the editing and saving process.
* **Error Handling:** The component now gracefully handles the case where `draftData` fails to load, displaying a clear error message.

**`Shortlist.jsx` Changes:**

Two entries for `Shortlist.jsx` exist in the log; a minor modification between 10:00 AM and 10:02 AM. The changes are subtle:  

* **Table Headings Modification:** The `tableHeadings` array, which defines column headers in the UI, was modified. Some column headers were renamed or reordered,  suggesting a refinement of the UI to present creator data.


Overall, the code changes reflect iterative development.  `EmailPreview.jsx` underwent a substantial refactor, while `Shortlist.jsx` received minor updates focused on UI refinement. The consistent use of the `userService` for API calls and the `GET_DRAFT_DATA` constant highlight a consistent backend interaction pattern.  The timestamps indicate focused development within a short time window.


## 12:52:26 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `BrandSummary.tsx` and `BrandReport.tsx`.  `BrandSummary.tsx` underwent numerous revisions between 10:20 AM and 11:41 AM,  with no substantive changes to the code detected in the diffs. The file appears to be a React component responsible for displaying brand summaries, likely using charts to visualize data.  The code includes functions to transform data (publications, journalists, regional mentions) for chart display. There's a use of dummy data, suggesting the component is designed to handle cases where real data is unavailable.

`BrandReport.tsx` was updated twice, at 10:47 AM and 11:55 AM. The first update involved adding a PDF generation function using `jspdf` and `html2canvas` libraries. The second update added a new API call for brand mentions to `fetchAllApis`, incorporated this new data into the state (`brandMention`, and  significantly expanded the  `handleSendReportAll` function to enable sending multiple reports via email.  The changes in `BrandReport.tsx` seem to focus on improving the report generation and email sending functionalities, including handling multiple recipients and providing feedback on success/failure.  The final update at 12:17 PM shows modifications to date calculation within `calculateDateRange` to use `Date` object methods instead of string manipulation and added logging for debugging purposes within `fetchAllApis`.  The `handleSendReportAll` function was refactored to improve clarity and error handling.  A significant change was removing the commented-out previous implementation of the `downloadPDF` function in favor of the improved version.  Further,  in `Narratives.tsx` multiple revisions between 11:13 AM and 12:37 PM occurred with changes in conditional rendering for mentioned outlets and streamlining of code without significant functional changes.


## 1:52:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `BrandSummary.tsx`, a React component responsible for displaying a brand's monthly report summary.  The core functionality remained consistent throughout the revisions, focusing on displaying data through bar and donut charts using `react-apexcharts`.  The changes primarily involved refinements and corrections within the data transformation and chart configuration sections.

The initial version (12:59:42 PM) included a commented-out `calculateSentimentScore` function, suggesting an earlier attempt at a different sentiment calculation method.  A revised `calculateSentimentScore` function was introduced later (1:09:17 PM), and this version persisted through the subsequent commits. This revised function calculates a sentiment score based on the difference between positive and negative counts, making it more direct than the commented-out version.

No substantial structural changes occurred.  The primary modifications focused on:

* **Data Transformation Functions:**  Minor adjustments were made to the `transformPublicationsData`, `transformJournalistsData`, `transformRegionalData`, and `transformBrandMentionData` functions, primarily for data cleaning and formatting, but the core logic did not change significantly.

* **Chart Configurations:** The code for configuring the bar and donut charts (for publications, brand mentions, and regional mentions) remained largely the same, with only minor adjustments to styling (font sizes, colors, etc.).  The use of dummy data (`dummyData`) persisted, providing fallback values if actual data was unavailable.

The timestamps indicate a period of active development between 12:59:42 PM and 1:20:31 PM, with several rapid iterations within a short timeframe.  The modifications during this period were incremental, suggesting debugging or fine-tuning of existing functionality rather than the introduction of major new features. The consistent use of dummy data suggests a development process where the component was tested and refined with placeholder data before integration with a data source.


## 3:52:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`.  Both files are React components dealing with email preview and content rendering.


**`EmailPreview.jsx` Changes:**

The `EmailPreview.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 2:53 PM and 3:40 PM on July 1st, 2025.  These revisions primarily focused on refining the UI and functionality related to email preview and editing.  The component fetches draft data using a `userService` and renders a preview of the email. A key feature is an editing mode (`isEditing` state), allowing users to modify the email content in a text area.  The code includes handling for attachments, allowing users to add or remove them.  Significant changes appear to be related to the styling and display of the email content and the addition of the edit mode. The final version seems to add no new functionality, only improving the display in edit mode.

**`EmailContent.jsx` Changes:**

The `EmailContent.jsx` file was modified at 3:00 PM and 3:13 PM on July 1st, 2025. The changes are centered around enhancing the rendering of email content. Initially, it focused on formatting the email text, adding support for tables, bold text, bullet points, and italics.  The later revision added a new prop, `isEditing`, which controls conditional rendering of  a "Editable Section" indicator  for the Campaign Brief section when in edit mode.  This strongly suggests an integration with the editing capabilities introduced in `EmailPreview.jsx`.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

Both files extensively use React functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), and Tailwind CSS for styling.  There's a consistent theme of handling data fetched from a backend service (`userService`) and dynamically rendering it to present a user-friendly email preview. The data structure seems to consistently include `draftData`, `attachments`, `deliverables`, and `campBrief`.  Both files show a pattern of converting plain text email content into a formatted, styled representation for the UI. The focus is on displaying structured data (like deliverables) in a table format.


## 4:52:25 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `BrandSummary.tsx`, a React component generating charts for a brand's monthly report.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions:  transforming data into chart-ready formats for publications, journalists, regional mentions, and brand mentions.  A sentiment score is also calculated.

The most significant changes occur in the font size within the xaxis labels of the publications chart.  Initially, the font size was '6px', then changed to '8px' at 4:04:34 PM, and finally settled at '7px' at 4:05:05 PM. This suggests iterative adjustments to improve readability.

There are no substantial structural or functional modifications to the code.  The changes primarily involve minor adjustments to chart styling (font sizes in the x-axis labels of the publications chart) and no changes in the data transformation functions.  The `calculateSentimentScore` function was also refined between the first and second revisions to use a different calculation method (removing neutral sentiment from the calculation).  The use of dummy data for fallback purposes remains consistent. All modifications happened within a short timeframe, between 4:02:03 PM and 4:46:14 PM on July 1st, 2025.


## 4:52:26 PM
The log shows updates to two React components: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the email preview functionality and improving its presentation.

**`EmailPreview.jsx` (July 1, 2025):**

The most significant changes in `EmailPreview.jsx` occurred between 3:58:17 PM and 4:19:26 PM.  The initial version (3:58:17 PM)  had a more simplistic email content generation process. It directly generated the email body from draft data,  including a deliverable table.  A key flaw was the crude method for restoring the original deliverable table if editing was cancelled.

The updated version (4:19:26 PM) refactored the email generation logic and implemented more sophisticated editing capabilities. Key improvements include:

* **Improved Email Template Generation:**  The email template is now generated using a dedicated `generateEmailTemplate` function, making the code more modular and readable. The campaign brief is now separated and handled within `extractCampaignBrief`.  A placeholder ("CAMPAIGN_BRIEF_PLACEHOLDER") is used for the brief in the original template, allowing for dynamic updates without regenerating the entire email.

* **Editable Campaign Brief:** The campaign brief section in the email is now separately editable. The `editableCampaignBrief` state variable tracks changes made to this section, ensuring that only the brief is updated when the user edits it.

* **Character Limit:** A character limit of 3000 was added to the email content textarea.

* **Enhanced UI:** A "Save Preview" / "Edit Preview" button was added to the UI to toggle editing, which uses `restoreOriginalContentWithUpdatedBrief` to revert to the correct state.  `EmailContent` is now rendered instead of directly showing the textarea in non-edit mode, providing better formatting.  The UI for attachments has also been improved to better organize them.  The display of the list of influencers has been added.

* **Error Handling:**  Improved handling of cases where draft data fails to load, providing better user feedback.


**`EmailContent.jsx` (July 1, 2025, 4:19:38 PM):**

This component was added to handle the formatting and rendering of the email content within `EmailPreview.jsx`. It intelligently formats the email content, rendering Markdown-like elements (bold, italics, bullets, tables) and adds visual cues for editable sections within the campaign brief.  This component improves the visual clarity of the email preview.  The `isEditing` prop controls whether the editable section highlighting appears.


## 5:52:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `BrandSummary.tsx` component between 4:53 PM and 4:59 PM on July 1st, 2025.  The component renders charts displaying brand performance data, including publications, brand mentions, regional mentions, and sentiment.

The most significant changes revolve around data transformation and chart configuration:

* **Data Transformation Functions:**  The `transformPublicationsData`, `transformRegionalData`, and `transformBrandMentionData` functions were refined throughout the revisions.  `transformPublicationsData` was modified to limit the displayed publications to the top 10. `transformRegionalData` was also adjusted to limit the number of regions displayed to 9 instead of 10 in the final revision.

* **Sentiment Score Calculation:** The `calculateSentimentScore` function underwent a change in its logic for calculating the sentiment score, moving from a weighted average to a calculation based on the difference between positive and negative sentiments.

* **Chart Configurations:**  Numerous minor adjustments were made to the chart configurations within the `useEffect` hook, primarily concerning styling and display options (e.g., font sizes, colors, chart heights, and tooltips).  These changes aimed to improve the visual presentation of the charts. Notably, there was a brief removal and then restoration of the regional chart configuration.

The overall pattern suggests iterative refinements to the component's data handling and visual aspects.  The use of dummy data in several places indicates a possible development or debugging phase.  The frequent updates in short intervals (within a few minutes) point to active development and testing.
