# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 12:59:10 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to three React component files between 12:28 AM and 12:55 AM on July 1st, 2025.

`SocialSummary.jsx`: This file, updated at 12:28:16 AM,  is a component displaying a summary of social media campaigns. It features filtering (by search term, status, and date range),  a table showing campaign details (name, creators, budget, status, etc.), and a button to create new campaigns. The table dynamically updates based on the applied filters.  The status is color-coded (Sent: green, Draft: yellow, Scheduled: red).

`EmailPreview.jsx`: This component underwent several revisions (12:28:58 AM, 12:33:19 AM, 12:33:55 AM, 12:39:26 AM, 12:39:47 AM, and 12:50:04 AM).  The core functionality involves displaying and editing email previews for campaigns. Initially, it was fully commented out, indicating a potential starting point.  Subsequent changes show the addition of functionality to fetch draft data from a backend service (`userService.get`), dynamically generate email content based on fetched data (including a deliverable table), and allow for editing of the email content.  A significant change around 12:39 AM introduced the ability to parse and update email sections (greeting, introduction, etc.) based on user input in a textarea. Finally the file was commented out again at 12:50 AM and 12:55 AM. There is also the handling of attachments, allowing adding and removing them from the draft email.

`Shortlist.jsx`: This file, with updates at 12:52:19 AM, 12:52:51 AM, 12:53:06 AM, and 12:55:36 AM, contains a component for shortlisting creators.  It's fully commented out in all entries, suggesting it was either in development or temporarily disabled during the logged period. The commented-out code suggests functionality for fetching creator data, filtering (search, verification status, contact information), selecting creators for engagement, and updating campaign data on the backend.  The component uses Next.js's navigation hooks (`usePathname`, `useSearchParams`, `useRouter`) for URL management and updating the URL based on filtering and selection changes.


## 9:52:15 AM
The log shows updates to two React components: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`.  `EmailPreview.jsx` underwent multiple revisions between 9:37 AM and 9:50 AM on July 1st, 2025, with no substantive changes in the code itself during those revisions. The component handles the preview of an email, fetching draft data using a `userService` and `GET_DRAFT_DATA` constant. It dynamically generates email content based on this draft data, allowing for editing and updates to different sections (greeting, introduction, call to action, etc.).  The code includes functions to generate a table of deliverables and to parse user-edited content to update the email's different sections. A loading indicator is displayed while fetching data.

The `EmailContent.jsx` component, updated at 9:51 AM on July 1st, 2025, focuses on rendering the formatted email content.  This update introduces a "Protected" indicator to table elements, visually distinguishing them as non-editable within the email preview. The component handles different formatting elements such as bold text, bullet points, italics, and tables, rendering them appropriately using React elements.  The addition of the "Protected" label suggests a change in functionality, likely to prevent editing of certain parts of the email content.


## 9:52:19 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `BrandReport.tsx` and `BrandSummary.tsx`.  The changes span several hours on July 1st, 2025.

`BrandReport.tsx`: This file underwent multiple revisions between 1:13 AM and 8:58 AM. The core functionality involves generating and sending PDF reports.  Early revisions show experimentation with different PDF generation approaches (using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`), with a final version settling on a method that divides long sections into multiple pages for better handling of larger reports.  A significant change around 1:14 AM involved adding another API call within the `fetchAllApis` function, likely to fetch additional data (`/BrandMention` endpoint). This API call was later removed in a subsequent commit at 8:58 AM.  The file consistently uses the `userService` for API interactions and `Alert` for displaying messages. The final version includes functionality to send a PDF report via email using a POST request (`/send-client-report`).


`BrandSummary.tsx`: This component focuses on displaying report summaries using charts.  It was modified between 9:00 AM and 9:27 AM. The changes primarily involved refactoring and commenting out the entire component. The initial versions show the use of `ReactApexChart` to render bar and donut charts visualizing data related to top publications, journalists, sentiment scores, and regional mentions.  Data transformation functions (`transformPublicationsData`, `transformJournalistsData`, `transformRegionalData`) process backend responses and handle data manipulation for charting purposes. The component incorporates dummy data for fallback and utilizes a function (`shortenOutletName`) to shorten publication names. Finally, the component was entirely commented out in the last revision.
