# Activity Summary for 7/20/2025

## 10:36:55 PM
The log shows three revisions of `CreateCampaign.jsx` on July 20, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is within the React component responsible for creating social media campaigns.

The first revision (6:12:21 PM) introduces a fully functional campaign creation form with fields for title, budget, brand name, brand goals (a dropdown menu), start and end dates, and a description. The form validates that the title and description are filled.  User information is retrieved from localStorage and included in the API request (`userService.post`).  Success and error notifications are implemented using a custom `useNotification` hook.  There is an unnecessary `formDataa` state variable that appears alongside the `formData` state variable.

The second revision (6:26:57 PM) removes the unnecessary `formDataa` state variable and its associated `handleChange` function, simplifying the component's state management.  No other functional changes are apparent.

The third revision (9:36:51 PM) contains a minor change. There's a redundant check for `formData` within the `isValid` variable, which is not used. The `isFormValid` variable is seemingly kept in place and seems to be the intended form validation.  The overall functionality remains the same.  The minor code change suggests a potential debugging or refactoring effort rather than a feature addition.
