# Activity Summary for 12/15/2025

## 1:40:14 PM
The changes log details updates across several frontend files, primarily focusing on the implementation and styling of a "WelcomeModal" component and its integration into the Dashboard.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\components\Dashboard\WelcomeModal.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (12/15/2025, 9:48:04 AM - 9:48:28 AM):** The file shows the structure of a `WelcomeModal` component for "MikeCLM" with feature points (AI extraction, deadline reminders, insights, e-signature). However, the core `WelcomeModal` function, including its JSX and styling logic, is entirely commented out, suggesting work-in-progress or a placeholder.
    *   **Uncommented & Active (12/15/2025, 9:49:23 AM):** The commented-out `WelcomeModal` component, including its Ant Design `Modal` structure and extensive inline styling (with responsive logic for mobile screens), is uncommented and made active.
    *   **Full Comment-Out (12/15/2025, 9:54:05 AM - 10:07:30 AM):** The entire content of the file, including imports, types, `welcomeModalData`, and the `WelcomeModal` component, is temporarily commented out.
    *   **Major Refactor & Styling Externalization (12/15/2025, 10:19:46 AM):** This is the most significant change.
        *   The file is uncommented.
        *   The component is renamed from `WelcomeModal` to `CLMWelcomeModal` and explicitly typed as `React.FC<WelcomeModalProps>`.
        *   All inline `style` attributes within the JSX are removed.
        *   A new SCSS import `../../stylesheets/components/_welcom_modal.scss` is added, indicating that styling has been externalized to a dedicated stylesheet. Corresponding `className` attributes are introduced in the JSX (`welcome-modal-no-close`, `welcome-modal-scroll`, `welcome-modal-root`, etc.).
        *   The icon rendering logic is simplified, assuming icons are always React components.
    *   **Minor Formatting (12/15/2025, 10:21:20 AM - 10:21:33 AM):** Subsequent minor changes involve inconsistent addition/removal of semicolons after import statements, but no functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\stylesheets\components\_welcom_modal.scss`**
    *   **Introduction of Stylesheet (12/15/2025, 10:05:55 AM):** This new file is introduced, centralizing all the styling for the welcome modal. It defines styles for the modal structure, header, content points, and CTA button, including media queries for responsive adjustments on mobile screens (max-width: 479px), mirroring the responsive logic previously found inline.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\utils\authService.ts`**
    *   **Snapshot of Auth Service (12/15/2025, 10:09:52 AM):** This entry provides a detailed view of an `AuthService` class. It includes methods for managing user authentication tokens (checking JWT format, validating token validity, refreshing tokens via an OAuth2 endpoint, processing tokens from URL hash, and user logout). It uses `localStorage` for token storage and logs extensive debug information related to authentication flows. No changes within the provided log range for this file.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\apps\MikeCLM\src\containers\Dashboard\Dashboard.tsx`**
    *   **WelcomeModal Integration (12/15/2025, 10:21:13 AM - 10:23:09 AM):** The `Dashboard` component is introduced, importing and rendering the `WelcomeModal`. It implements logic to control the `WelcomeModal`'s visibility using `localStorage` (key: `"welcome_modal_clm"`) to show it once per user after a 1-second delay. It also sets `user_id` in `localStorage`. The dashboard also displays various contract metrics, a calendar, contract tables, and an Insights drawer.
    *   **Import Cleanup (12/15/2025, 12:14:55 PM):** The `selectUserId` import from `@mike-clm/shared` is removed, indicating a change in how `userId` is accessed.
    *   **Constant Usage (12/15/2025, 12:25:52 PM):** The hardcoded `localStorage` key `"welcome_modal_clm"` is replaced with the newly imported constant `WELCOME_MODAL_CLM`, improving code maintainability.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\constants\constant.ts`**
    *   **Existing Constants & Cleanup (12/15/2025, 12:17:38 PM - 12:18:25 PM):** The file contains various utility constants (regex, `copyToClipboard`, `monthList`, sort type maps). An incomplete `export const = ` line is removed.
    *   **New Constant for Welcome Modal (12/15/2025, 12:19:11 PM):** A new constant `WELCOME_MODAL_CLM = 'welcome_modal_clm'` is added to store the `localStorage` key.
    *   **No Further Changes (12/15/2025, 12:20:45 PM - 12:22:02 PM):** The content remains unchanged in subsequent entries.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\clm-frontend\shared\src\lib\constants\index.ts`**
    *   **Exporting New Constant (12/15/2025, 12:19:18 PM):** The `WELCOME_MODAL_CLM` constant is imported from `./constant` and re-exported, making it accessible as part of the shared library's public API.
    *   **Minor Formatting (12/15/2025, 12:19:25 PM):** A trailing comma is added to the export statement.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Refactoring for maintainability:** A consistent pattern emerges where inline styles in React components are moved to dedicated SCSS files, improving separation of concerns. Hardcoded string literals are also replaced with shared constants (e.g., `WELCOME_MODAL_CLM`), enhancing code readability and reducing potential errors.
*   **Welcome Modal Implementation:** The primary development focus is on the `WelcomeModal` component, its styling, and its integration into the `Dashboard`. This includes logic to ensure it appears only once per user using `localStorage`.
*   **Component State Management:** The `Dashboard` component handles the state (`isWelcomeOpen`) and user interaction (`onCtaClick`, `onClose`) for the `WelcomeModal`.
*   **Time-based Development:** There are distinct phases of development: an intense period of refactoring and component integration in the morning (around 9:48 AM - 10:21 AM), followed by minor clean-ups and constant externalization in the late morning/early afternoon (around 12:14 PM - 12:25 PM).
*   **The welcome modal content remains consistent across all changes, highlighting features like "AI powered extraction", "Automated deadline reminder", "Contract insights", and "E‑Signature done easy" for "MikeCLM".**
