# Activity Summary for 12/20/2025

## 9:23:05 PM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`.

**File-Specific Updates for `FileManager.jsx`:**

*   **12/19/2025, 12:42:51 PM**: The file was initially defined. It contains a React component named `FileManager` responsible for handling file management functionalities within a case tracking application.
    *   **Functionality**: It allows users to upload individual files and entire directories to S3, download all associated case documents, and track upload progress.
    *   **Key Features**:
        *   Fetches existing case documents using `axios`.
        *   Generates S3 pre-signed URLs for secure uploads.
        *   Manages upload progress and status (Uploading, Completed, Failed) for multiple files using `useState` and displays them in an `UploadProgressBar` modal.
        *   Supports canceling active uploads using `AbortController`.
        *   Provides options to re-upload failed files.
        *   Integrates with `antd` components (Button, Upload, message) for UI.
        *   Uses Redux (`useSelector`) to access user data.
        *   Includes an `useOnlineStatus` hook to manage UI elements based on network connectivity.
        *   Tracks user interactions (`EVENTS.BUTTON_CLICKED`) for analytics.
        *   Handles errors using a utility function `handleAxiosError`.
        *   Requires a `management_case_id` from `searchParams`.
*   **12/19/2025, 4:34:57 PM**: The *entire* content of the `FileManager.jsx` file was commented out. This change effectively deactivates the `FileManager` component and all its related functionalities.
*   **12/19/2025, 4:35:37 PM**: The file content was restored to its original, uncommented state, identical to the version from 12:42:51 PM. This re-activates the `FileManager` component.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **12/19/2025, 12:42:51 PM**: Establishment of the functional `FileManager` component.
*   **12/19/2025, 4:34:57 PM**: Full commenting out of the `FileManager` component.
*   **12/19/2025, 4:35:37 PM**: Immediate restoration (uncommenting) of the `FileManager` component.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **React Component Structure**: The file consistently defines a functional React component using hooks like `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useState`, and `useSearchParams`.
*   **API Interactions**: Extensive use of `axios` for GET and POST requests to a `ROOT_URL` endpoint, particularly for document operations (fetching, getting signed URLs, and confirming uploads).
*   **Authentication**: All API calls include an `Authorization` header with a bearer token obtained via `getValidAccessToken()`.
*   **Error Handling**: Consistent use of `handleAxiosError(error)` in `catch` blocks for API requests.
*   **State Management**: Reliance on local component state (`useState`) for `filesData`, `loaderType`, `uploadStatus`, and `isUploadModalVisible`, and Redux (`useSelector`) for global `userData`.
*   **File Upload Logic**: A multi-step process for uploads involving: 1. getting an S3 signed URL, 2. constructing `FormData`, 3. posting to S3 with progress tracking, and 4. updating backend records.
*   **Upload Progress Tracking**: The `uploadStatus` state object and `UploadProgressBar` component are central to showing real-time upload progress and statuses (Uploading, Completed, Failed).
*   **Network Awareness**: The `useOnlineStatus` hook is used to conditionally enable/disable upload and download buttons, indicating a focus on user experience in varying network conditions.
*   **Rapid Reversion**: The most striking pattern is the rapid succession of commenting out and uncommenting the entire file within a minute, suggesting a temporary debugging action, a quick test, or an accidental commit and immediate rollback.

## 10:45:40 PM
The `FileManager.jsx` file underwent a series of rapid changes on December 19, 2025.

At **12:42:51 PM**, the file contained a React component named `FileManager`. This component is responsible for handling document management for cases, including:
*   Fetching existing documents related to a `management_case_id`.
*   Uploading new files and directories to S3 using pre-signed URLs, with features like progress tracking, cancellation via `AbortController`, and re-uploading.
*   Downloading all associated files for a case.
*   Integrating with Ant Design components for UI, Redux for user data, and a custom `useOnlineStatus` hook.
*   It logs button click events and handles Axios errors gracefully.

A significant, albeit temporary, change occurred at **4:34:57 PM**. The *entire* content of the `FileManager.jsx` file was commented out. This effectively deactivated the component, suggesting either a temporary disablement, an intentional pause for refactoring, or a preparatory step for removal or replacement.

Immediately after, at **4:35:37 PM**, the code was fully restored. All comments added in the previous timestamp were removed, returning the `FileManager` component to its original, active state identical to the 12:42:51 PM version.

**Key Pattern:** The rapid succession of commenting out and then uncommenting the entire file within a minute indicates a very brief, possibly accidental, or quickly reverted change. There were no functional code modifications between the initial and final states; the change was solely in the active/inactive status of the component.
