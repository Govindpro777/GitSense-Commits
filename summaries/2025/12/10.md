# Activity Summary for 12/10/2025

## 9:26:45 AM
The log details the incremental development of a backend application, focusing on server setup, database connection, and a user data model.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Backend_Practice1\server.js`**:
    *   **Initial Setup (12/9/2025, 8:48:35 PM):** Began with setting up an Express application, defining `PORT` from environment variables or defaulting to `3000`, and initiating `app.listen()`.
    *   **Port & Logging Refinement (12/9/2025, 8:49:27 PM):** The default `PORT` was changed to `5000`, and the `app.listen()` call was completed with a callback to log the server's running status and port. Several subsequent entries between 8:50 PM and 8:51 PM show minor, non-functional code changes, likely re-saves or formatting adjustments, without altering the core logic from 8:49:27 PM.
    *   **Integration of Dependencies (12/9/2025, 9:21:51 PM - 9:22:57 PM):** Imports for `connectMongoDb` from `./config/db.js` and `cors` were added. The `connectMongoDb()` function was then invoked.
    *   **Environment Variable Configuration (12/9/2025, 9:26:41 PM - 9:26:59 PM):** The `dotenv` package was introduced and configured (`dotenv.config()`) to load environment variables.
    *   **CORS Middleware (12/9/2025, 10:43:02 PM):** `app.use(cors())` was added to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Backend_Practice1\config\db.js`**:
    *   **Initial Skeleton (12/9/2025, 9:16:18 PM):** Started as a placeholder, initially incorrectly importing `express`, and defining `MONGODB_URI`.
    *   **Mongoose & Connection Function (12/9/2025, 9:17:45 PM - 9:18:47 PM):** The file was updated to import `mongoose` and define an `async` function `connectMongoDb`. This function was developed to connect to MongoDB using `mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI)` within a `try...catch` block.
    *   **Logging & Export (12/9/2025, 9:19:33 PM - 9:20:00 PM):** Console logs were added for connection success ("MongoDB connected") and initial error reporting. The `connectMongoDb` function was then exported as the default.
    *   **Enhanced Error Handling (12/9/2025, 9:20:31 PM - 9:20:45 PM):** The error handling was improved to catch the specific `error` object, log it using `console.error(error)`, and terminate the process (`process.exit(1)`) upon connection failure.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Backend_Practice1\Modal\User.js`**:
    *   **Model Initialization (12/9/2025, 10:45:14 PM - 10:46:08 PM):** A new file was created to define a Mongoose schema for users. It began by importing `mongoose` and initializing `userSchema` with `new mongoose.Schema({})`, then setting up `export const User = mongoose.model('Usser', userSchema)`.
    *   **Schema Field Definition (12/9/2025, 10:46:25 PM - 11:23:20 PM):** The `userSchema` was progressively populated with fields:
        *   `name`: `type: String, require: true`
        *   `email`: `type: String, require: true`
        *   `password`: `type: String, require: true`
        *   `createdAt`: `type: Date, default: Date.now` (with a minor correction in the `default` value's syntax).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Phased Development:** The changes demonstrate a clear progression in building the backend: first setting up the server, then configuring the database connection, integrating it, and finally defining a data model.
*   **Environment Variable Reliance:** Both `server.js` and `config/db.js` consistently use `process.env` for `PORT` and `MONGODB_URI`, indicating a structured approach to configuration. The explicit addition of `dotenv.config()` in `server.js` reinforces this pattern.
*   **Standard Backend Stack:** The code utilizes common Node.js backend patterns, including Express for the server, Mongoose for MongoDB ORM, and `cors` for handling cross-origin requests.
*   **Error Handling:** There's a noticeable effort to implement robust error handling, especially in the database connection logic, with `try...catch` blocks, informative console logs, and process termination on critical failures.
