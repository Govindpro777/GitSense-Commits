The code changes primarily focus on enhancing product information display and user onboarding within the MikeLegal-Web application, particularly for its IP Solutions suite.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\products.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 9:31:31 AM - 11:06:44 AM**: Product links for `IPSuite`, `DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `CLM`, and `Litigator` were updated from development/staging URLs (e.g., `ipsuitedev.mikelegal.com`) to their production counterparts (e.g., `ipsuite.mikelegal.com`).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 11:11:31 AM - 11:16:40 AM**: The `DocReview` product's direct `link` and `buttonText` were removed or set to empty strings, suggesting a shift from direct access to a different interaction model, possibly via a "Know more" prompt.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\KnowMorePopup.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 9:50:44 AM**: The `KnowMoreModal` component was introduced, providing a reusable modal with `framer-motion` animations to display detailed product introductions, feature points, and contact information.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 10:57:39 AM**: A minor capitalization change in the modal's heading from "Know More about" to "Know more about".

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\KnowMore.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 10:58:55 AM**: This file was created to define the `KnowMoreContent` interface and the `KNOW_MORE_CONTENT` object, centralizing detailed content for various products (IPSuite, Litigator, DocReview, DocChat, DocCompare, CLM) to be displayed in the `KnowMoreModal`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 10:59:22 AM**: A small textual correction in the `Litigator` product's heading, adding a space: "MikeLitigator" became "Mike Litigator".

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Products\ProductCards.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 11:12:33 AM**: A major refactor integrated the `KnowMoreModal` into the product cards. "Access Tool" buttons for some products (e.g., `ipSolutionsProducts`) were replaced or augmented with "Know more" buttons that trigger the new modal. State management (`useState`) was added to control the modal's visibility and content dynamically.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 11:13:52 AM - 11:16:24 AM**: Brief syntax errors and corrections related to conditional rendering of the "Access Tool" button for `contractSolutionsProducts`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\IPSolutions\TMHeroSection.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:07:35 PM**: A typo was corrected in a conditional statement, changing `heroSection.title1 === 'MikeTM Watc'` to `heroSection.title1 === 'MikeTM Watch'`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\[id]\page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:09:22 PM**: Initial structure for dynamic product pages (e.g., TMWatch, TMSearch), utilizing many dynamically imported components and `mikeTMData` for content.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:20:42 PM**: Introduced `WelcomeModal` to the page, making it appear on mount (`useEffect`). The entire previous content was commented out and replaced with the new implementation.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:15:33 PM**: Further refined the `WelcomeModal` integration to render conditionally only for specific IP Solutions ('TMWatch', 'TMSearch', 'TMManager') and pass a `variant` prop to personalize its content.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\WelcomeModal.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:05:32 PM**: Initial static implementation of a `WelcomeModal` for "MikeTM Search" with hardcoded features and styling.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:28:44 PM**: Major refactor to make the modal dynamic, accepting a `variant` prop to fetch content from `welcomeModalData`. The modal's heading, subheading, features, and CTA button are now dynamically rendered.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:29:29 PM - 1:47:21 PM**: Numerous styling and content adjustments:
        *   CTA button `borderRadius` changed from `999` to `8px` and background color from `#2563eb` to `#0066FF`.
        *   Icon container `borderRadius` changed from `12` to `8px`, and background color from `#e0edff` to `#E6F0FF`.
        *   Icon `width` and `height` increased from `24` to `32`.
        *   Font sizes (`fs-18` to `fs-20`), colors (`color-n12`), and other utility classes (`text-justify`, `text-center`, `mb-32`) were applied, transitioning from inline styles to CSS classes.
        *   The heading rendering logic was simplified and stabilized to correctly display "Welcome to [Product Name]".
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:01:09 PM**: Added an `onCtaClick` prop to allow custom actions when the CTA button is clicked and further simplified heading rendering logic.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:13:29 PM**: Removed the default close icon from the Ant Design `Modal` and adjusted modal body `borderRadius`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:18:44 PM - 2:25:15 PM**: Continued refinements to the heading's structure and styling, explicitly separating "Welcome to" from the dynamic product name with specific classes.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:27:12 PM**: Removed a redundant `background: '#ffffff'` style from the main modal content div.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\welcomeModel.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:13:17 PM**: This file was created to store structured data for the `WelcomeModal` for `TMWatch`, `TMManager`, and `TMSearch`, including headings, subheadings, CTA labels, and detailed feature points with icons and descriptions.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:26:52 PM**: Updated generic `/dummy-...png` image paths to specific SVG assets (e.g., `TMWatch_1.svg`).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:20:20 PM**: Simplified the `heading` for `TMWatch` (from 'Welcome to MikeTM Watch' to 'MikeTM Watch'), delegating the "Welcome to" prefix rendering to the `WelcomeModal` component itself.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\globals.css`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:45:14 PM**: Numerous utility CSS classes were added for font sizes (e.g., `.fs-14`, `.fs-20`), neutral colors (e.g., `.color-n9`, `.color-n12`), margins (e.g., `.mb-8`, `.mb-32`), and text alignment (`.text-justify`, `.text-balance`), indicating a standardization of styling.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **Morning (9:31 AM - 11:17 AM):** Initial product link updates (production readiness), introduction of the `KnowMoreModal` and its content data.
*   **Mid-day (12:05 PM - 12:20 PM):** First implementation of a `WelcomeModal` and its integration into dynamic product pages (`app/[id]/page.tsx`).
*   **Afternoon (1:13 PM - 2:27 PM):** Major refactor of `WelcomeModal` to be data-driven and reusable using `welcomeModalData`. This phase included extensive styling adjustments, fixing heading display logic, and introducing a dedicated CTA click handler. New global CSS utility classes were also added during this period.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Modularization and Reusability:** There's a clear pattern of moving static content into dedicated constant files (`_constants/KnowMore.ts`, `_constants/welcomeModel.ts`) and creating reusable, dynamic components (`KnowMoreModal`, `WelcomeModal`) that consume this data through props.
2.  **User Experience Enhancement:** The introduction and refinement of both "Know more" popups and "Welcome" modals suggest a focus on improving how users discover product features and get started with new tools.
3.  **Deployment Readiness:** The consistent updates of development/staging URLs to production ones across various product definitions indicate preparation or post-deployment adjustments for a live environment.
4.  **Styling Consistency:** The creation of numerous utility CSS classes in `globals.css` and the subsequent migration of inline styles to these classes within components like `WelcomeModal.tsx` demonstrates an effort to standardize the application's visual design and make styling more manageable.
5.  **IP Solutions Focus:** Many changes specifically address the "MikeTM" suite of products (Watch, Search, Manager), implying active development and new feature introductions for these intellectual property tools.
