The code changes primarily focus on enhancing product information display and user onboarding within the MikeLegal-Web application, particularly for its IP Solutions suite.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\products.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 9:31:31 AM - 11:06:44 AM**: Product links for `IPSuite`, `DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `CLM`, and `Litigator` were updated from development/staging URLs (e.g., `ipsuitedev.mikelegal.com`) to their production counterparts (e.g., `ipsuite.mikelegal.com`).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 11:11:31 AM - 11:16:40 AM**: The `DocReview` product's direct `link` and `buttonText` were removed or set to empty strings, suggesting a shift from direct access to a different interaction model, possibly via a "Know more" prompt.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\KnowMorePopup.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 9:50:44 AM**: The `KnowMoreModal` component was introduced, providing a reusable modal with `framer-motion` animations to display detailed product introductions, feature points, and contact information.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 10:57:39 AM**: A minor capitalization change in the modal's heading from "Know More about" to "Know more about".

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\KnowMore.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 10:58:55 AM**: This file was created to define the `KnowMoreContent` interface and the `KNOW_MORE_CONTENT` object, centralizing detailed content for various products (IPSuite, Litigator, DocReview, DocChat, DocCompare, CLM) to be displayed in the `KnowMoreModal`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 10:59:22 AM**: A small textual correction in the `Litigator` product's heading, adding a space: "MikeLitigator" became "Mike Litigator".

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Products\ProductCards.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 11:12:33 AM**: A major refactor integrated the `KnowMoreModal` into the product cards. "Access Tool" buttons for some products (e.g., `ipSolutionsProducts`) were replaced or augmented with "Know more" buttons that trigger the new modal. State management (`useState`) was added to control the modal's visibility and content dynamically.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 11:13:52 AM - 11:16:24 AM**: Brief syntax errors and corrections related to conditional rendering of the "Access Tool" button for `contractSolutionsProducts`.

    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:07:35 PM**: A typo was corrected in a conditional statement, changing `heroSection.title1 === 'MikeTM Watc'` to `heroSection.title1 === 'MikeTM Watch'`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\[id]\page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:09:22 PM**: Initial structure for dynamic product pages (e.g., TMWatch, TMSearch), utilizing many dynamically imported components and `mikeTMData` for content.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:20:42 PM**: Introduced `WelcomeModal` to the page, making it appear on mount (`useEffect`). The entire previous content was commented out and replaced with the new implementation.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:15:33 PM**: Further refined the `WelcomeModal` integration to render conditionally only for specific IP Solutions ('TMWatch', 'TMSearch', 'TMManager') and pass a `variant` prop to personalize its content.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\WelcomeModal.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:05:32 PM**: Initial static implementation of a `WelcomeModal` for "MikeTM Search" with hardcoded features and styling.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:28:44 PM**: Major refactor to make the modal dynamic, accepting a `variant` prop to fetch content from `welcomeModalData`. The modal's heading, subheading, features, and CTA button are now dynamically rendered.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:29:29 PM - 1:47:21 PM**: Numerous styling and content adjustments:
        *   CTA button `borderRadius` changed from `999` to `8px` and background color from `#2563eb` to `#0066FF`.
        *   Icon container `borderRadius` changed from `12` to `8px`, and background color from `#e0edff` to `#E6F0FF`.
        *   Icon `width` and `height` increased from `24` to `32`.
        *   Font sizes (`fs-18` to `fs-20`), colors (`color-n12`), and other utility classes (`text-justify`, `text-center`, `mb-32`) were applied, transitioning from inline styles to CSS classes.
        *   The heading rendering logic was simplified and stabilized to correctly display "Welcome to [Product Name]".
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:01:09 PM**: Added an `onCtaClick` prop to allow custom actions when the CTA button is clicked and further simplified heading rendering logic.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:13:29 PM**: Removed the default close icon from the Ant Design `Modal` and adjusted modal body `borderRadius`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:18:44 PM - 2:25:15 PM**: Continued refinements to the heading's structure and styling, explicitly separating "Welcome to" from the dynamic product name with specific classes.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:27:12 PM**: Removed a redundant `background: '#ffffff'` style from the main modal content div.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\welcomeModel.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:13:17 PM**: This file was created to store structured data for the `WelcomeModal` for `TMWatch`, `TMManager`, and `TMSearch`, including headings, subheadings, CTA labels, and detailed feature points with icons and descriptions.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:26:52 PM**: Updated generic `/dummy-...png` image paths to specific SVG assets (e.g., `TMWatch_1.svg`).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:20:20 PM**: Simplified the `heading` for `TMWatch` (from 'Welcome to MikeTM Watch' to 'MikeTM Watch'), delegating the "Welcome to" prefix rendering to the `WelcomeModal` component itself.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\globals.css`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:45:14 PM**: Numerous utility CSS classes were added for font sizes (e.g., `.fs-14`, `.fs-20`), neutral colors (e.g., `.color-n9`, `.color-n12`), margins (e.g., `.mb-8`, `.mb-32`), and text alignment (`.text-justify`, `.text-balance`), indicating a standardization of styling.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **Morning (9:31 AM - 11:17 AM):** Initial product link updates (production readiness), introduction of the `KnowMoreModal` and its content data.
*   **Mid-day (12:05 PM - 12:20 PM):** First implementation of a `WelcomeModal` and its integration into dynamic product pages (`app/[id]/page.tsx`).
*   **Afternoon (1:13 PM - 2:27 PM):** Major refactor of `WelcomeModal` to be data-driven and reusable using `welcomeModalData`. This phase included extensive styling adjustments, fixing heading display logic, and introducing a dedicated CTA click handler. New global CSS utility classes were also added during this period.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Modularization and Reusability:** There's a clear pattern of moving static content into dedicated constant files (`_constants/KnowMore.ts`, `_constants/welcomeModel.ts`) and creating reusable, dynamic components (`KnowMoreModal`, `WelcomeModal`) that consume this data through props.
2.  **User Experience Enhancement:** The introduction and refinement of both "Know more" popups and "Welcome" modals suggest a focus on improving how users discover product features and get started with new tools.
3.  **Deployment Readiness:** The consistent updates of development/staging URLs to production ones across various product definitions indicate preparation or post-deployment adjustments for a live environment.
4.  **Styling Consistency:** The creation of numerous utility CSS classes in `globals.css` and the subsequent migration of inline styles to these classes within components like `WelcomeModal.tsx` demonstrates an effort to standardize the application's visual design and make styling more manageable.
5.  **IP Solutions Focus:** Many changes specifically address the "MikeTM" suite of products (Watch, Search, Manager), implying active development and new feature introductions for these intellectual property tools.

## 3:28:29 PM
The log details a concentrated effort on December 9, 2025, to refine product information, implement a dynamic welcome modal system, and enhance responsive design across several files within the `MikeLegal-Web` project.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\products.ts`**:
    *   Between 11:02:50 AM and 11:06:44 AM, there was a series of updates to product links, migrating them from development or staging URLs (`doccomparedev.mikelegal.com`, `clm-staging.mikelegal.com`, `mikelitigatordev.mikelegal.com`) to their respective production domains (`doccompare.mikelegal.com`, `clm.mikelegal.com`, `litigator.mikelegal.com`).
    *   Later, at 11:11:31 AM and 11:16:40 AM, the `docreview` product's `link` and `buttonText` properties were set to empty strings, effectively deactivating direct access to that tool.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Products\ProductCards.tsx`**:
    *   Around 11:12:33 AM, the rendering logic for product action buttons was modified. For `ipSolutionsProducts` and `litigationSolutionsProducts`, the primary "Access Tool" button was commented out or conditionally removed, replaced by a "Know more" button that triggers a `KnowMoreModal`.
    *   Subsequent changes (11:13:52 AM - 11:16:24 AM) involved temporary and then reverted attempts to add more complex conditional rendering around the "Access Tool" button for `contractSolutionsProducts`, ultimately settling back to a state where the button is shown if `product?.buttonText` exists.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\WelcomeModal.tsx`**:
    *   The initial version at 12:05:32 PM was a static `WelcomeModal` for "MikeTM Search" with hardcoded content and inline styles.
    *   A major refactor occurred around 1:28:44 PM, making the modal dynamic. It now accepts a `variant` prop (`TMWatch`, `TMSearch`, `TMManager`) to fetch content (heading, subheading, CTA label, and feature points) from an external data source (`welcomeModalData`).
    *   Throughout the afternoon (1:29:29 PM - 2:53:11 PM), numerous styling and layout adjustments were made:
        *   CTA button `borderRadius` and `background` color changes.
        *   Feature icon container `borderRadius` and `background` color changes.
        *   Increased image dimensions for feature icons.
        *   Extensive adoption of `clamp()` CSS function for responsive sizing of padding, margins, font sizes, image dimensions, and button sizes, replacing fixed pixel values.
        *   Refinements to text classes (e.g., `fs-18` to `fs-20`, adding `fw-600`, `text-balance`, `text-justify`).
        *   The header rendering logic was simplified to prepend "Welcome to" to the dynamic heading content.
        *   The modal's default close icon was removed (`closeIcon={null}`).
        *   Responsive grid column logic was added for feature points, switching from two columns to one on smaller screens.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\[id]\page.tsx`**:
    *   Initial integration of `TMHeroSection` and various dynamic components (12:09:22 PM).
    *   The file underwent a significant change at 12:20:42 PM, where a `WelcomeModal` was introduced, managed by `useState` and `useEffect` to display it on page mount.
    *   At 1:15:33 PM, logic was added to conditionally render the `WelcomeModal` only for specific `id` variants (`TMWatch`, `TMSearch`, `TMManager`), using a `hasWelcomeContent` flag and passing the `id` as a `variant` prop.
    *   The most notable update at 3:07:18 PM implemented user session persistence for the `WelcomeModal`. The modal's `open` state is now controlled by `localStorage`, ensuring it only appears once per product (`WelcomeModal${id}`) for a given user, with a `handleWelcomeCta` function to dismiss it and update `localStorage`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\welcomeModel.ts`**:
    *   This new file was created at 1:13:17 PM to centralize the content for the dynamic `WelcomeModal` for `TMWatch`, `TMManager`, and `TMSearch` products, including headings, subheadings, CTA labels, and an array of feature points with icons, titles, and descriptions.
    *   At 1:26:52 PM, the SVG icon import paths were updated to a consistent naming convention (e.g., `TMWatch1.svg` to `TMWatch_1.svg`).
    *   At 2:20:20 PM, the `TMWatch` heading was adjusted from "Welcome to MikeTM Watch" to "MikeTM Watch", reflecting the decision to prepend "Welcome to" within the `WelcomeModal` component itself.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\globals.css`**:
    *   A single snapshot at 1:45:14 PM shows the definition of global CSS variables for colors, shadows, border radii, and utility classes for typography, margins, and weights, along with media queries for general responsiveness and styles for loading animations.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Transition to Production:** A clear pattern of updating development/staging URLs to production URLs across multiple product entries in `products.ts`.
*   **Dynamic UI Components:** The introduction and extensive development of the `WelcomeModal` demonstrate a shift towards more dynamic, data-driven UI components.
*   **Responsive Design Focus:** Significant effort was put into making the `WelcomeModal` highly responsive using modern CSS techniques like `clamp()` and flexible grid layouts.
*   **User Experience Enhancement:** The implementation of `localStorage` for the `WelcomeModal` aims to improve user experience by preventing repetitive pop-ups for returning users.
*   **Component Modularity:** The creation of `welcomeModel.ts` to separate modal content from the UI logic in `WelcomeModal.tsx` and `page.tsx` reflects good modular design principles.
*   **Iterative Development:** The multiple sequential changes to `WelcomeModal.tsx` and `page.tsx`, often involving commenting out large sections and then reintroducing refined code, indicate an iterative development and debugging process.
