The code changes primarily focus on enhancing product information display and user onboarding within the MikeLegal-Web application, particularly for its IP Solutions suite.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\products.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 9:31:31 AM - 11:06:44 AM**: Product links for `IPSuite`, `DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `CLM`, and `Litigator` were updated from development/staging URLs (e.g., `ipsuitedev.mikelegal.com`) to their production counterparts (e.g., `ipsuite.mikelegal.com`).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 11:11:31 AM - 11:16:40 AM**: The `DocReview` product's direct `link` and `buttonText` were removed or set to empty strings, suggesting a shift from direct access to a different interaction model, possibly via a "Know more" prompt.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\KnowMorePopup.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 9:50:44 AM**: The `KnowMoreModal` component was introduced, providing a reusable modal with `framer-motion` animations to display detailed product introductions, feature points, and contact information.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 10:57:39 AM**: A minor capitalization change in the modal's heading from "Know More about" to "Know more about".

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\KnowMore.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 10:58:55 AM**: This file was created to define the `KnowMoreContent` interface and the `KNOW_MORE_CONTENT` object, centralizing detailed content for various products (IPSuite, Litigator, DocReview, DocChat, DocCompare, CLM) to be displayed in the `KnowMoreModal`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 10:59:22 AM**: A small textual correction in the `Litigator` product's heading, adding a space: "MikeLitigator" became "Mike Litigator".

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Products\ProductCards.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 11:12:33 AM**: A major refactor integrated the `KnowMoreModal` into the product cards. "Access Tool" buttons for some products (e.g., `ipSolutionsProducts`) were replaced or augmented with "Know more" buttons that trigger the new modal. State management (`useState`) was added to control the modal's visibility and content dynamically.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 11:13:52 AM - 11:16:24 AM**: Brief syntax errors and corrections related to conditional rendering of the "Access Tool" button for `contractSolutionsProducts`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\IPSolutions\TMHeroSection.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:07:35 PM**: A typo was corrected in a conditional statement, changing `heroSection.title1 === 'MikeTM Watc'` to `heroSection.title1 === 'MikeTM Watch'`.

    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:09:22 PM**: Initial structure for dynamic product pages (e.g., TMWatch, TMSearch), utilizing many dynamically imported components and `mikeTMData` for content.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:20:42 PM**: Introduced `WelcomeModal` to the page, making it appear on mount (`useEffect`). The entire previous content was commented out and replaced with the new implementation.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:15:33 PM**: Further refined the `WelcomeModal` integration to render conditionally only for specific IP Solutions ('TMWatch', 'TMSearch', 'TMManager') and pass a `variant` prop to personalize its content.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\WelcomeModal.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 12:05:32 PM**: Initial static implementation of a `WelcomeModal` for "MikeTM Search" with hardcoded features and styling.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:28:44 PM**: Major refactor to make the modal dynamic, accepting a `variant` prop to fetch content from `welcomeModalData`. The modal's heading, subheading, features, and CTA button are now dynamically rendered.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:29:29 PM - 1:47:21 PM**: Numerous styling and content adjustments:
        *   CTA button `borderRadius` changed from `999` to `8px` and background color from `#2563eb` to `#0066FF`.
        *   Icon container `borderRadius` changed from `12` to `8px`, and background color from `#e0edff` to `#E6F0FF`.
        *   Icon `width` and `height` increased from `24` to `32`.
        *   Font sizes (`fs-18` to `fs-20`), colors (`color-n12`), and other utility classes (`text-justify`, `text-center`, `mb-32`) were applied, transitioning from inline styles to CSS classes.
        *   The heading rendering logic was simplified and stabilized to correctly display "Welcome to [Product Name]".
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:01:09 PM**: Added an `onCtaClick` prop to allow custom actions when the CTA button is clicked and further simplified heading rendering logic.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:13:29 PM**: Removed the default close icon from the Ant Design `Modal` and adjusted modal body `borderRadius`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:18:44 PM - 2:25:15 PM**: Continued refinements to the heading's structure and styling, explicitly separating "Welcome to" from the dynamic product name with specific classes.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:27:12 PM**: Removed a redundant `background: '#ffffff'` style from the main modal content div.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\welcomeModel.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:13:17 PM**: This file was created to store structured data for the `WelcomeModal` for `TMWatch`, `TMManager`, and `TMSearch`, including headings, subheadings, CTA labels, and detailed feature points with icons and descriptions.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:26:52 PM**: Updated generic `/dummy-...png` image paths to specific SVG assets (e.g., `TMWatch_1.svg`).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 2:20:20 PM**: Simplified the `heading` for `TMWatch` (from 'Welcome to MikeTM Watch' to 'MikeTM Watch'), delegating the "Welcome to" prefix rendering to the `WelcomeModal` component itself.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\globals.css`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/9/2025, 1:45:14 PM**: Numerous utility CSS classes were added for font sizes (e.g., `.fs-14`, `.fs-20`), neutral colors (e.g., `.color-n9`, `.color-n12`), margins (e.g., `.mb-8`, `.mb-32`), and text alignment (`.text-justify`, `.text-balance`), indicating a standardization of styling.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **Morning (9:31 AM - 11:17 AM):** Initial product link updates (production readiness), introduction of the `KnowMoreModal` and its content data.
*   **Mid-day (12:05 PM - 12:20 PM):** First implementation of a `WelcomeModal` and its integration into dynamic product pages (`app/[id]/page.tsx`).
*   **Afternoon (1:13 PM - 2:27 PM):** Major refactor of `WelcomeModal` to be data-driven and reusable using `welcomeModalData`. This phase included extensive styling adjustments, fixing heading display logic, and introducing a dedicated CTA click handler. New global CSS utility classes were also added during this period.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Modularization and Reusability:** There's a clear pattern of moving static content into dedicated constant files (`_constants/KnowMore.ts`, `_constants/welcomeModel.ts`) and creating reusable, dynamic components (`KnowMoreModal`, `WelcomeModal`) that consume this data through props.
2.  **User Experience Enhancement:** The introduction and refinement of both "Know more" popups and "Welcome" modals suggest a focus on improving how users discover product features and get started with new tools.
3.  **Deployment Readiness:** The consistent updates of development/staging URLs to production ones across various product definitions indicate preparation or post-deployment adjustments for a live environment.
4.  **Styling Consistency:** The creation of numerous utility CSS classes in `globals.css` and the subsequent migration of inline styles to these classes within components like `WelcomeModal.tsx` demonstrates an effort to standardize the application's visual design and make styling more manageable.
5.  **IP Solutions Focus:** Many changes specifically address the "MikeTM" suite of products (Watch, Search, Manager), implying active development and new feature introductions for these intellectual property tools.

## 3:28:29 PM
The log details a concentrated effort on December 9, 2025, to refine product information, implement a dynamic welcome modal system, and enhance responsive design across several files within the `MikeLegal-Web` project.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\products.ts`**:
    *   Between 11:02:50 AM and 11:06:44 AM, there was a series of updates to product links, migrating them from development or staging URLs (`doccomparedev.mikelegal.com`, `clm-staging.mikelegal.com`, `mikelitigatordev.mikelegal.com`) to their respective production domains (`doccompare.mikelegal.com`, `clm.mikelegal.com`, `litigator.mikelegal.com`).
    *   Later, at 11:11:31 AM and 11:16:40 AM, the `docreview` product's `link` and `buttonText` properties were set to empty strings, effectively deactivating direct access to that tool.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Products\ProductCards.tsx`**:
    *   Around 11:12:33 AM, the rendering logic for product action buttons was modified. For `ipSolutionsProducts` and `litigationSolutionsProducts`, the primary "Access Tool" button was commented out or conditionally removed, replaced by a "Know more" button that triggers a `KnowMoreModal`.
    *   Subsequent changes (11:13:52 AM - 11:16:24 AM) involved temporary and then reverted attempts to add more complex conditional rendering around the "Access Tool" button for `contractSolutionsProducts`, ultimately settling back to a state where the button is shown if `product?.buttonText` exists.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\WelcomeModal.tsx`**:
    *   The initial version at 12:05:32 PM was a static `WelcomeModal` for "MikeTM Search" with hardcoded content and inline styles.
    *   A major refactor occurred around 1:28:44 PM, making the modal dynamic. It now accepts a `variant` prop (`TMWatch`, `TMSearch`, `TMManager`) to fetch content (heading, subheading, CTA label, and feature points) from an external data source (`welcomeModalData`).
    *   Throughout the afternoon (1:29:29 PM - 2:53:11 PM), numerous styling and layout adjustments were made:
        *   CTA button `borderRadius` and `background` color changes.
        *   Feature icon container `borderRadius` and `background` color changes.
        *   Increased image dimensions for feature icons.
        *   Extensive adoption of `clamp()` CSS function for responsive sizing of padding, margins, font sizes, image dimensions, and button sizes, replacing fixed pixel values.
        *   Refinements to text classes (e.g., `fs-18` to `fs-20`, adding `fw-600`, `text-balance`, `text-justify`).
        *   The header rendering logic was simplified to prepend "Welcome to" to the dynamic heading content.
        *   The modal's default close icon was removed (`closeIcon={null}`).
        *   Responsive grid column logic was added for feature points, switching from two columns to one on smaller screens.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\[id]\page.tsx`**:
    *   Initial integration of `TMHeroSection` and various dynamic components (12:09:22 PM).
    *   The file underwent a significant change at 12:20:42 PM, where a `WelcomeModal` was introduced, managed by `useState` and `useEffect` to display it on page mount.
    *   At 1:15:33 PM, logic was added to conditionally render the `WelcomeModal` only for specific `id` variants (`TMWatch`, `TMSearch`, `TMManager`), using a `hasWelcomeContent` flag and passing the `id` as a `variant` prop.
    *   The most notable update at 3:07:18 PM implemented user session persistence for the `WelcomeModal`. The modal's `open` state is now controlled by `localStorage`, ensuring it only appears once per product (`WelcomeModal${id}`) for a given user, with a `handleWelcomeCta` function to dismiss it and update `localStorage`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\welcomeModel.ts`**:
    *   This new file was created at 1:13:17 PM to centralize the content for the dynamic `WelcomeModal` for `TMWatch`, `TMManager`, and `TMSearch` products, including headings, subheadings, CTA labels, and an array of feature points with icons, titles, and descriptions.
    *   At 1:26:52 PM, the SVG icon import paths were updated to a consistent naming convention (e.g., `TMWatch1.svg` to `TMWatch_1.svg`).
    *   At 2:20:20 PM, the `TMWatch` heading was adjusted from "Welcome to MikeTM Watch" to "MikeTM Watch", reflecting the decision to prepend "Welcome to" within the `WelcomeModal` component itself.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\globals.css`**:
    *   A single snapshot at 1:45:14 PM shows the definition of global CSS variables for colors, shadows, border radii, and utility classes for typography, margins, and weights, along with media queries for general responsiveness and styles for loading animations.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Transition to Production:** A clear pattern of updating development/staging URLs to production URLs across multiple product entries in `products.ts`.
*   **Dynamic UI Components:** The introduction and extensive development of the `WelcomeModal` demonstrate a shift towards more dynamic, data-driven UI components.
*   **Responsive Design Focus:** Significant effort was put into making the `WelcomeModal` highly responsive using modern CSS techniques like `clamp()` and flexible grid layouts.
*   **User Experience Enhancement:** The implementation of `localStorage` for the `WelcomeModal` aims to improve user experience by preventing repetitive pop-ups for returning users.
*   **Component Modularity:** The creation of `welcomeModel.ts` to separate modal content from the UI logic in `WelcomeModal.tsx` and `page.tsx` reflects good modular design principles.
*   **Iterative Development:** The multiple sequential changes to `WelcomeModal.tsx` and `page.tsx`, often involving commenting out large sections and then reintroducing refined code, indicate an iterative development and debugging process.

## 4:28:53 PM
The log details a concentrated period of development, primarily focused on introducing and refining a `WelcomeModal` component across various product pages.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\welcomeModel.ts`**
    *   **Initial data definition (12/9/2025, 1:27:37 PM):** This file was first established to export `welcomeModalData`, a JavaScript object containing structured content (headings, subheadings, CTA labels, and feature points with icons and descriptions) for "MikeTM Watch," "MikeTM Manager," and "MikeTM Search" welcome modals.
    *   **Heading Refinement (12/9/2025, 2:20:20 PM):** The `heading` for "TMWatch" was simplified from `'Welcome to MikeTM Watch'` to `'MikeTM Watch'`, implying that the "Welcome to" prefix would be handled directly by the modal component itself for consistency.
    *   **Major Content Expansion (12/9/2025, 3:36:41 PM):** The `welcomeModalData` object was significantly expanded to include new product categories: "Mike DocChat," "Mike DocCompare," "MikeCLM," and "MikeLitigator." Each new entry includes a heading, subheading, CTA label, and a set of unique selling points with associated image paths.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\WelcomeModal.tsx`**
    *   This component underwent numerous rapid iterations, mainly focusing on styling, responsiveness, and functional integration.
    *   **Initial Implementation (12/9/2025, 1:28:44 PM):** The `WelcomeModal` React component was introduced, using Ant Design's `Modal` and Framer Motion for animations. It consumed `welcomeModalData` and applied initial inline styles for layout, typography, and interactive elements.
    *   **Styling & Refactoring (12/9/2025, 1:29:29 PM - 1:47:21 PM):** A series of changes involved converting inline styles to CSS classes (`fs-XX`, `color-nX`, `fw-XXX`, `mb-XX`, `text-justify`, `text-balance`) for better maintainability and consistency. Specific adjustments included button `borderRadius` and `background` color, icon container `borderRadius`, and icon image `width`/`height`. Heading logic for dynamically adding "Welcome to" was unstable and frequently adjusted/reverted in this period.
    *   **Major Functional Refactor (12/9/2025, 2:01:09 PM):** The component was significantly re-written. It introduced an `onCtaClick` prop, streamlining the main heading rendering logic (expecting `content.heading` to be provided without "Welcome to"), and adding an `onClick` handler to the CTA button.
    *   **UI/Accessibility Enhancements (12/9/2025, 2:13:29 PM):** The default close icon for the modal was removed (`closeIcon={null}`).
    *   **Heading Structure Standardization (12/9/2025, 2:18:44 PM - 2:25:15 PM):** The "Welcome to" prefix was explicitly added as a separate `<span>` within the `<h2>`, styled consistently, followed by the dynamically provided `content.heading`. This ensures a standardized look regardless of the `welcomeModalData`'s heading format.
    *   **Minor Layout Adjustments (12/9/2025, 2:30:38 PM - 2:32:07 PM):** Small tweaks to `marginTop` for icons and consolidation of point title styling.
    *   **Responsive Grid (12/9/2025, 2:34:33 PM - 2:37:22 PM):** Initial attempts were made to make the points grid responsive, dynamically adjusting `gridTemplateColumns`, `rowGap`, and `columnGap` based on window width (`isMobile`). This specific conditional logic was later reverted.
    *   **Comprehensive Responsive Styling (12/9/2025, 2:41:51 PM):** A significant overhaul replaced many fixed pixel values with `clamp()` functions for padding, margins, and font sizes across the modal, greatly improving its responsiveness. The grid layout for points was simplified to use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, 250px), 1fr))` for inherent responsiveness, removing the explicit `isMobile` checks for grid columns.
    *   **CTA Button Sizing (12/9/2025, 2:46:45 PM - 2:47:45 PM):** The `maxWidth` of the CTA button was iteratively adjusted using `clamp()` values.
    *   **Text Balancing (12/9/2025, 2:52:11 PM):** The `text-balance` class was added to the subheading for better typography.
    *   **Variant Type Expansion (12/9/2025, 3:59:18 PM & 4:14:07 PM):** The `WelcomeModalProps` interface's `variant` type was updated to include new product categories like `DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `CLM`, and `Litigator`, reflecting the expansion of `welcomeModel.ts`.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\globals.css`**
    *   **Major Styling Overhaul (12/9/2025, 1:45:14 PM):** This global CSS file received a substantial update. It introduced a comprehensive set of CSS variables for colors, shadows, and border radii. It also defined responsive font sizes, utility classes for layout, margins, padding, text alignment, and font weights, and included keyframe animations (`slideInLeft`). This suggests a move towards a more robust and scalable design system.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\[id]\page.tsx`** (dynamic route for IP solutions like TMWatch, TMSearch, TMManager)
    *   **Initial Welcome Modal Integration (12/9/2025, 1:49:05 PM):** The `WelcomeModal` component was integrated. Initial state management (`isWelcomeOpen` with `useEffect`) was set up to open the modal automatically on page load for specific variants.
    *   **"Show Once" Logic Implementation (12/9/2025, 3:07:18 PM):** The logic was enhanced to use `localStorage`. The modal now checks if it has been previously dismissed for a given product (`WelcomeModal${id}`) by looking at `localStorage`. A `handleWelcomeCta` function was introduced to set a `localStorage` flag to `'false'` upon CTA click, ensuring the modal only appears once per user per product.

5.  **New Product Pages (`DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `Litigator`, `DocReview`):**
    *   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocChat\page.tsx` (12/9/2025, 3:58:39 PM):** The `DocChat` page was created and immediately integrated with the `WelcomeModal` and its `localStorage`-based "show once" functionality, using a dedicated key `'WelcomeModalDocChat'`.
    *   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocCompare\page.tsx` (12/9/2025, 4:03:35 PM - 4:05:16 PM):** The `DocCompare` page was integrated with the `WelcomeModal`. Initially, a copy-paste error led to it using `"DocChat"` as its `variant` and `localStorage` key, which was later corrected to `"DocCompare"` for the `variant` but the `localStorage` key remained `'WelcomeModalDocChat'` in the last recorded entry, indicating a pending correction.
    *   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\Litigator\page.tsx` (12/9/2025, 4:04:02 PM - 4:11:02 PM):** Similar to `DocCompare`, the `Litigator` page saw integration of the `WelcomeModal`. Initial copy-paste errors for `variant` and `localStorage` key (using `"DocChat"` and then `"DocCompare"`) were progressively corrected, finally using `variant="Litigator"` and `localStorage` key `'WelcomeModalLitigator'`.
    *   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocReview\page.tsx` (12/9/2025, 4:03:46 PM - 4:04:56 PM):** The `DocReview` page was also integrated with the `WelcomeModal`. It also started with `variant="DocChat"` and `localStorage` key `'WelcomeModalDocChat'`, and was updated to `variant="DocCompare"` (still incorrect for `DocReview`), but the `localStorage` key remained `'WelcomeModalDocChat'`. This page still shows an incorrect variant assignment.

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocChat\layout.tsx` (12/9/2025, 4:21:24 PM):** A new layout file was created for the `DocChat` page, providing specific metadata (title, description, keywords).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Welcome Modal Feature**: The most prominent pattern is the widespread implementation and iterative refinement of a `WelcomeModal` across various product-specific pages. This suggests a new, consistent onboarding or informational pop-up strategy.
*   **"Show Once" Logic**: The `localStorage`-based mechanism to prevent the `WelcomeModal` from reappearing after its initial dismissal is a consistent feature applied across all pages integrating the modal.
*   **Centralized Content**: The `welcomeModel.ts` file acts as a single source of truth for the modal's content, allowing easy management and expansion for new products.
*   **Responsive Design Focus**: The repeated adjustments to CSS, particularly the extensive use of `clamp()` functions in `WelcomeModal.tsx` and the definition of CSS variables/utility classes in `globals.css`, indicate a strong emphasis on creating a responsive and adaptive user interface.
*   **Iterative Development**: Many small, rapid changes to `WelcomeModal.tsx` and its page integrations, including temporary comments, reverts, and step-by-step corrections of copy-paste errors (especially for `variant` and `localStorage` keys), highlight an active, iterative development process.

## 5:28:17 PM
The changes primarily revolve around the `WelcomeModal.tsx` component, its associated data in `welcomeModel.ts`, and its integration into various page components like `[id]/page.tsx`, `DocChat/page.tsx`, `DocCompare/page.tsx`, and `Litigator/page.tsx`. A minor update was also observed in `css/globals.css`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\WelcomeModal.tsx` (Multiple timestamps from 12/9/2025, 1:31:55 PM to 2:53:11 PM, then again from 4:14:07 PM to 4:30:39 PM):**
    *   **Initial Development & Refinement (1:31 PM - 1:38 PM):** The `WelcomeModal` component was initially implemented using `Ant Design`'s `Modal`, `framer-motion` for animations, and `Next.js` `Image` component. It dynamically fetches content based on a `variant` prop from `welcomeModalData`. Initial changes focused on adjusting styling attributes, such as font sizes and margins (e.g., `fs-18` to `fs-20`, `marginBottom` from 4 to 8 for titles).
    *   **Styling Adjustments & Responsiveness (1:38 PM - 1:47 PM):**
        *   The background color for icons within the points section was changed from `#e0edff` to `#E6F0FF`.
        *   The `span` element displaying the content heading was modified to use a CSS class `color-primary` instead of inline style `#2563eb`.
        *   The `p` tag for `point.description` was updated with `className='fs-14 color-n9 text-justify'` and its inline `fontSize` removed, suggesting a shift towards utility classes.
        *   The main heading logic was simplified, removing complex `replace` and `includes` conditions for `MikeTM` prefixes, relying directly on `content.heading` for the primary colored text.
        *   The sub-heading `<p>` tag also transitioned to using utility classes (`fs-14 color-n9`).
    *   **Functionality & Prop Updates (2:01 PM - 2:13 PM):**
        *   The component was almost entirely commented out and then re-introduced, indicating a significant refactor or a temporary rollback for testing.
        *   The `WelcomeModalProps` interface was extended to include an `onCtaClick` prop, and this prop was implemented in the main call-to-action button, making the button interactive.
        *   The `Modal` component's `closeIcon` prop was set to `null`, removing the default close icon.
        *   The import path for `welcomeModalData` was briefly changed to `welcomeModalData` (from `welcomeModel`) and then reverted, suggesting a temporary file name change or typo.
    *   **Heading & Dynamic Styling (2:18 PM - 2:37 PM):**
        *   The main `h2` heading structure was refactored to explicitly display "Welcome to " with a `color-n12` class, followed by the `content.heading` in `color-primary`. This ensures consistent "Welcome to" phrasing.
        *   Dynamic grid column layout was introduced for the `content.points` section, changing from a fixed `1fr 1fr` to `1fr` for mobile screens (`window.innerWidth < 480`) and `1fr 1fr` for desktop, along with responsive `rowGap` and `columnGap`.
    *   **Responsive Styling with `clamp()` and Image Size Adjustments (2:41 PM - 4:30 PM):**
        *   Extensive use of CSS `clamp()` function for responsive padding, font sizes (`h2`, `p`, `point.title`, `point.description`), gaps, margins, and button dimensions (`padding`, `max-width`). This indicates a significant effort towards making the modal highly responsive.
        *   Image `width` and `height` properties within the `point` rendering loop were updated from fixed `32` to dynamic `clamp()` values (e.g., `width={40}` to `width={38}` and `style={{width: 'clamp(30px, 6vw, 45px)'}}`), affecting icon sizing for responsiveness.
        *   A `text-balance` class was added to the `subHeading` paragraph, likely for improved text layout.
        *   The `marginTop` for the point icons was also adjusted using `clamp()`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\welcomeModel.ts` (Multiple timestamps from 12/9/2025, 2:01:24 PM to 4:00:33 PM, then 3:36:41 PM):**
    *   **Rename and Heading Simplification (2:01 PM - 2:21 PM):**
        *   Initially, the file was named `welcomeModel.ts` and briefly seen as `welcomeModalData` in imports before being consistently `welcomeModel.ts`.
        *   The `heading` properties for `TMWatch`, `TMManager`, and `TMSearch` were updated to remove the "Welcome to " prefix, as this is now handled directly in the `WelcomeModal` component's JSX.
    *   **Expansion of Welcome Modal Data (3:36 PM):** A significant update introduced new entries to `welcomeModalData` for additional product variants: `DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `CLM`, and `Litigator`. Each new entry includes a `heading`, `subHeading`, `ctaLabel`, and a `points` array with icons, titles, and descriptions, mirroring the existing structure. This indicates an expansion of the welcome modal's applicability to more features.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\[id]\page.tsx` (Multiple timestamps from 12/9/2025, 1:49:05 PM to 3:07:18 PM):**
    *   **Integration of WelcomeModal (1:49 PM):** The `WelcomeModal` component was integrated into the dynamic `IPSolution` page. This involved:
        *   Importing `WelcomeModal`.
        *   Adding `isWelcomeOpen` state and `useEffect` to initially open the modal.
        *   Conditionally rendering `WelcomeModal` based on whether `id` is 'TMWatch', 'TMSearch', or 'TMManager'.
    *   **Persistent Welcome Modal (3:07 PM):** Logic was added to use `localStorage` to control the `WelcomeModal`'s visibility. The modal will only open once for a given `id` variant if it hasn't been explicitly closed (by clicking the CTA, which sets a `false` flag in `localStorage`). This ensures the modal is a "first-time user experience" feature.
    *   **Handling `onCtaClick`:** The `WelcomeModal` component was updated to pass the `handleWelcomeCta` function to the new `onCtaClick` prop, which both closes the modal and updates `localStorage`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\globals.css` (12/9/2025, 1:45:14 PM):**
    *   **New Utility Classes:** Added `fs-14`, `fs-18`, `fs-20`, `fs-28` for font sizes.
    *   **Color Variables:** Introduced new color variables for neutral shades (`--neutral-1` to `--neutral-13`).
    *   **`text-balance` Class:** Added a `text-balance` class with `text-wrap: balance`, `margin-bottom: 10px`, and `letter-spacing: 1px`, which was later used in `WelcomeModal.tsx`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocChat\page.tsx`, `app\DocCompare\page.tsx`, `app\Litigator\page.tsx` (Multiple timestamps from 12/9/2025, 3:58:39 PM to 4:11:02 PM, and subsequent minor fixes):**
    *   **WelcomeModal Integration:** Similar to `[id]/page.tsx`, the `WelcomeModal` component was integrated into these specific product pages. Each integration includes `useState` for `isWelcomeOpen`, `useEffect` to check `localStorage` for first-time display (using `WelcomeModalDocChat`, `WelcomeModalDocCompare`, or `WelcomeModalLitigator` as storage keys), and a `handleWelcomeCta` function to close the modal and persist its state. The `variant` prop is set specifically for each page (e.g., `variant="DocChat"`).
    *   **Minor Adjustments:** Some initial changes to `DocCompare/page.tsx`, `DocReview/page.tsx`, and `Litigator/page.tsx` included temporary comments or minor restructuring before the `WelcomeModal` integration was finalized. Notably, `DocReview/page.tsx` temporarily had its `WelcomeModal` variant set to "DocChat" and then "DocCompare", suggesting some copy-pasting or quick testing before it was potentially removed or updated to a different variant (as `DocReview` wasn't explicitly added to `welcomeModalData` variants that support welcome modals at the end of the log).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocChat\layout.tsx` (12/9/2025, 4:21:24 PM):**
    *   Added `metadata` for the DocChat page, including `title`, `description`, and `keywords`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Welcome Modal Implementation:** A consistent pattern of integrating the `WelcomeModal` component across various product pages (MikeTM Watch, Search, Manager, DocChat, DocCompare, Litigator) has emerged. This modal is designed to show a "Welcome to [Product Name]" message with key features and a call-to-action button.
*   **First-Time User Experience (FTUE) Logic:** The use of `localStorage` (`WelcomeModal[Variant]`) to ensure the welcome modal is shown only once per product per user (or until `localStorage` is cleared) is a strong recurring pattern.
*   **Dynamic Content Loading:** The `WelcomeModal` consistently uses a `variant` prop to fetch specific content from `welcomeModalData`, highlighting a modular approach to content management.
*   **Responsive Design:** There's a clear trend towards implementing responsive design, notably through the use of CSS utility classes (`fs-XX`, `color-nX`) and the `clamp()` function for fluid typography and spacing in the `WelcomeModal.tsx` file. Dynamic grid column adjustments based on screen width also reflect this.
*   **Ant Design and Framer Motion:** These libraries are consistently used for UI components (Modal) and animations, respectively, across the `WelcomeModal` component.
*   **Next.js Dynamic Imports:** Page components heavily utilize `dynamic` imports with `SkeletonLoader` as a fallback, indicating a strategy for optimizing initial page load by lazy-loading components.
*   **JSX/TSX Styling:** A mix of inline styles and CSS utility classes is present, with a gradual shift towards utility classes for common properties (`font-size`, `color`, `margin`).
*   **Extensive Commenting/Uncommenting:** A notable pattern in several files (`page.tsx` files and `WelcomeModal.tsx`) is the frequent commenting out and then uncommenting/revising of large blocks of code. This suggests active development, experimentation, or significant reworks occurring within short timeframes.

## 8:07:18 PM
The log details changes across three files in a `MikeLegal-Web` project: `components\Common\WelcomeModal.tsx`, `css\globals.css`, and `app\[id]\page.tsx` (and other page files like `DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `Litigator`). The changes primarily revolve around a `WelcomeModal` component and its integration into various pages, with an additional update to a constant data file.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Common\WelcomeModal.tsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 12/9/2025, 1:31:55 PM and 12/9/2025, 4:30:39 PM)
    *   **Initial Setup & Styling Refinements:** The component, a React functional component using Ant Design's `Modal` and Framer Motion for animations, was introduced. Early changes primarily involve adjusting inline styles and class names for `h2` and `p` tags within the modal.
        *   `1:34:31 PM`: Changed `fs-18` to `fs-20` for point titles.
        *   `1:34:53 PM`: Added `mb-8` class to point titles.
        *   `1:35:20 PM`: Removed `mb-8` from point titles and re-added `marginBottom: 4`.
        *   `1:35:56 PM`: Changed the background color of the icon container from `#e0edff` to `#E6F0FF`.
        *   `1:37:33 PM`: Fixed a typo in `content.heading.replace('Welcome t ', '')`.
        *   `1:37:48 PM`: Changed `span` color from inline style `color: '#2563eb'` to a CSS class `color-primary`.
        *   `1:38:09 PM` to `1:39:33 PM`: Numerous small adjustments to the heading logic for displaying "Welcome to" or just the heading, mostly related to `content.heading.replace('MikeTM', '').includes(...)`. The logic simplified to just displaying "Welcome to" followed by the modified heading.
        *   `1:43:41 PM`: Modified the description paragraph's style, adding `className='fs-14 color-n9 text-justify'`.
        *   `1:45:26 PM` & `1:46:16 PM`: Replaced inline styles for `div` elements with CSS classes like `text-center mb-32` and `fs-14 color-n9` for the subheading.
    *   **Functionality & Prop Updates:**
        *   `2:01:09 PM`: The component was largely commented out and then uncommented with significant functional changes.
            *   Import path for `welcomeModalData` changed from `welcomeModel` to `welcomeModalData`.
            *   Added a new prop `onCtaClick: () => void;` to the `WelcomeModalProps` interface, and integrated it with the CTA button's `onClick` event.
            *   Modified the `h2` rendering logic: `content.heading.replace('MikeTM', '').includes(...)` was removed, simplifying the title to "Welcome to" followed by `content.heading.replace('Welcome to ', '')`.
        *   `2:13:29 PM`: Added `closeIcon={null}` to the `Modal` component, removing the default close icon.
        *   `2:17:21 PM`: Changed `borderRadius` for `body` style in `Modal` from `24` to `'24px'`.
        *   `2:18:44 PM`: Reverted the heading `span` logic to explicitly include "Welcome to" as a separate `span` element with `fs-32 fw-600 color-n12 mr-8` classes, making the specific heading (e.g., "MikeTM Watch") colored with `color-primary`.
        *   `2:20:33 PM`: Further refined the heading rendering: `content.heading.replace('Welcome to ', '')` was removed from the primary colored span, so it now directly displays `content.heading`. This means `welcomeModalData` would need to store just "MikeTM Watch" instead of "Welcome to MikeTM Watch".
        *   `2:25:00 PM` to `2:25:15 PM`: Consolidated the `h2` styling, moving `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `color`, and `marginBottom` into class names, but then reverted `color` and `marginBottom` to inline styles while keeping `fs-32 fw-600 mb-8 color-n12` and explicitly adding `Welcome to` with a space.
        *   `2:34:33 PM`: Added responsive `gridTemplateColumns`, `rowGap`, and `columnGap` for the points section, dynamically switching to a single column layout on mobile (`window.innerWidth < 480`).
        *   `2:41:51 PM`: Introduced CSS `clamp()` function for various padding, margin, font size, and image dimensions (`width`, `height`) to enhance responsiveness across screen sizes. This included adjusting `maxWidth` for the CTA button.
        *   `2:44:02 PM` to `2:47:45 PM`: Minor adjustments to `padding`, `fontSize` and `maxWidth` values for button styling using `clamp()`.
        *   `2:52:11 PM`: Added `text-balance` class to the subheading paragraph.
        *   `2:52:56 PM`: Added `text-justify` class to the point titles (`.fs-20.color-n12.fw-600`).
        *   `2:53:11 PM`: Removed `text-justify` from the point titles, retaining it only for the point descriptions.
    *   **Image Sizing:**
        *   `4:27:53 PM`: Changed `Image` width and height from `32` to `40`.
        *   `4:28:40 PM`: Changed `Image` width and height to `38`, with dynamic styling to clamp `width` and `height` from `34px` to `50px`.
        *   `4:29:52 PM`: Further refined image sizing to `width={38} height={38}` with `clamp` from `30px` to `45px`.
        *   `4:30:39 PM`: Adjusted `marginTop` for the icon container from `clamp(2px, 1vw, 6px)` to `clamp(3px, 1vw, 8px)`.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\[id]\page.tsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 12/9/2025, 1:49:05 PM and 12/9/2025, 3:07:18 PM)
    *   **Initial Commenting Out and Re-enabling:** The entire content of the file was commented out, then re-enabled, suggesting a temporary disablement or a large-scale refactor.
    *   **WelcomeModal Integration:**
        *   `1:49:05 PM`: Integrated the `WelcomeModal` component.
            *   Imported `WelcomeModal`.
            *   Introduced `isWelcomeOpen` state (initialized to `false`) and a `useEffect` hook to set it to `true` on component mount, meaning the modal opens automatically.
            *   Added conditional rendering for `WelcomeModal` based on `hasWelcomeContent` (for `TMWatch`, `TMSearch`, `TMManager` variants).
    *   `3:07:18 PM`: Enhanced `WelcomeModal` persistence:
        *   Added a `localStorage` check (`WelcomeModal${id}`) to control `isWelcomeOpen` state, ensuring the modal is shown only once per product variant (unless `localStorage` is cleared).
        *   Introduced `handleWelcomeCta` function to close the modal and set the `localStorage` item to `'false'` upon CTA click, preventing it from showing again.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\css\globals.css`** (12/9/2025, 1:45:14 PM)
    *   **New CSS Class:** Added a new CSS class `.text-balance { text-wrap: balance; margin-bottom: 10px; letter-spacing: 1px; }`.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\_constants\welcomeModel.ts`** (Multiple timestamps between 12/9/2025, 2:01:24 PM and 12/9/2025, 4:00:33 PM)
    *   **Filename Renaming (Implicit):** The `WelcomeModal.tsx` file suggests this file was initially named `welcomeModel.ts` and later referenced as `welcomeModalData`.
    *   **Heading Simplification:**
        *   `2:20:20 PM` & `2:21:36 PM`: Changed the `heading` for `TMWatch` variant from 'Welcome to MikeTM Watch' to 'MikeTM Watch'. This change aligns with the new heading rendering logic in `WelcomeModal.tsx` which now explicitly adds "Welcome to" before `content.heading`.
    *   **Expansion of Welcome Modal Data:**
        *   `3:36:41 PM` & `3:38:14 PM` & `4:00:33 PM`: The most significant update is the addition of several new entries to the `welcomeModalData` object: `DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `CLM`, and `Litigator`. Each new entry includes a `heading`, `subHeading`, `ctaLabel`, and an array of `points` with `id`, `icon` (imported from `public/assets/IPSolutions/WelcomeModal/`), `title`, and `description`. This indicates an expansion of the welcome modal functionality to other product pages.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocChat\page.tsx`**, **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocCompare\page.tsx`**, **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\Litigator\page.tsx`**, **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocReview\page.tsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 12/9/2025, 3:58:39 PM and 12/9/2025, 4:11:02 PM)
    *   **WelcomeModal Integration:** These page files were updated to include the `WelcomeModal` component.
        *   Imported `WelcomeModal`.
        *   Implemented `isWelcomeOpen` state and `useEffect` with `localStorage` persistence, similar to `app\[id]\page.tsx`, to show the welcome modal only once for each specific page (`DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `Litigator`).
        *   The `variant` prop for `WelcomeModal` is set to the respective page's identifier (e.g., `"DocChat"`, `"DocCompare"`, `"Litigator"`).
        *   Initially, `DocCompare`, `DocReview`, and `Litigator` pages incorrectly used `"DocChat"` as the variant for their `WelcomeModal` (e.g., `4:04:56 PM` in `DocReview\page.tsx` uses `variant="DocCompare"` but `storageKey = 'WelcomeModalDocChat'`), which was later corrected to match the page's actual variant (e.g., `4:09:56 PM` in `DocCompare\page.tsx` uses `storageKey = 'WelcomeModalDocCompare'`).

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\app\DocChat\layout.tsx`** (12/9/2025, 4:21:24 PM)
    *   Added `metadata` for `DocChat` page, including `title`, `description`, and `keywords`. This is a standard Next.js metadata definition.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **WelcomeModal as a Central Feature:** A `WelcomeModal` component is consistently being refined and integrated across multiple product pages (`TMWatch`, `TMSearch`, `TMManager`, `DocChat`, `DocCompare`, `CLM`, `Litigator`). This suggests a strategy to introduce users to features of each product upon their first visit.
*   **Persistent Modals:** The use of `localStorage` for `isWelcomeOpen` state indicates a pattern to show the welcome modal only once per product variant, providing a better user experience by not repeatedly showing it after the initial dismissal.
*   **Responsive Design:** Frequent use of CSS `clamp()` functions and conditional rendering based on `window.innerWidth < 480` (for `isMobile`) highlights a strong focus on ensuring the modal is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
*   **Styling Consistency:** The use of CSS classes (`fs-`, `color-`, `fw-`, `mb-`, `text-center`, `text-justify`, `text-balance`) alongside inline styles for styling elements within the modal. There's a gradual shift from purely inline styling to using utility classes and then to a more dynamic, responsive inline styling approach using `clamp()`.
*   **Dynamic Component Imports:** The use of `next/dynamic` with `SkeletonLoader` for various components (`Navbar`, `Footer`, `HeroSection`, `HowWorks`, etc.) is a recurring pattern across the page files, indicating a performance optimization strategy (lazy loading).
*   **Data-Driven Content:** The `WelcomeModal` relies on `welcomeModalData` (from `welcomeModel.ts`) to populate its content based on the `variant` prop, making it a reusable component for different product welcome messages.
*   **Commenting/Uncommenting Code:** Multiple instances of large blocks of code being commented out and then re-enabled suggest phases of development, testing, or temporary disablement of features.
