# Activity Summary for 12/18/2025

## 3:29:59 PM
The `ThankYou.jsx` file, initially logged at `12/18/2025, 2:30:25 PM`, is a React component designed to display a confirmation message after a form submission. It retrieves submitted form data (name, phone, email, project type) from `localStorage`, displays it, and provides a button to navigate back to the home page. A subsequent update at `12/18/2025, 3:17:12 PM` modified the email contact link within the component from `info@nxlevellandscaping.com` to `quotes@nxlevellandscaping.com`.

The `Contact.jsx` file underwent several significant changes. At `12/18/2025, 2:31:13 PM`, it was a functional contact page featuring a hero section, a native contact form that simulates an API call, stores data in `localStorage`, and navigates to the `/thank-you` page. It also included contact information (address, phone, email, hours) and a Google Maps embed, with an initial attempt to dynamically load a Typeform embed script.
Between `12/18/2025, 2:40:11 PM` and `12/18/2025, 2:46:17 PM`, the entire content of `Contact.jsx` was commented out in several iterative commits, effectively disabling the component.
A major re-enablement and refactor occurred at `12/18/2025, 2:48:27 PM`. The component was uncommented and updated to use the `@typeform/embed` package for Typeform integration, employing `useRef` and `useEffect` for widget mounting and unmounting, replacing the previous script loading method. Both the Typeform embed and the native form were present.
Further rapid changes were logged:
*   At `12/18/2025, 2:49:25 PM`, the Typeform embed container was accidentally duplicated in the JSX.
*   By `12/18/2025, 2:49:57 PM`, the native contact form (`<form>`) was commented out, making the Typeform embed the primary submission method. Additionally, the `Contact Info & Map` section was also largely commented out.
*   At `12/18/2025, 2:50:58 PM`, the `Contact Info & Map` section was re-enabled, specifically the contact detail blocks and the Google Maps iframe, while the native form remained commented out.
*   Subsequent updates at `12/18/2025, 3:16:10 PM` and `12/18/2025, 3:18:15 PM` focused on refining the contact information. The "Address" block was commented out, and the phone number listed in the contact section was updated from `(702) 555-1234` to `(702)-348-6380`, along with the email being `quotes@nxlevellandscaping.com`.

The `Footer.jsx` component, first seen at `12/18/2025, 3:15:50 PM`, provides company information, service links, contact details (phone: `(702)-348-6380`, email: `quotes@nxlevellandscaping.com`, hours), and license information. The address contact information in the footer was commented out. At `12/18/2025, 3:19:23 PM`, the "Service Area" text in the footer's bottom bar was commented out.

The `Navbar.jsx` component, appearing at `12/18/2025, 3:17:24 PM`, sets up the site's navigation. It includes a top bar with contact information (phone: `(702) 555-1234`, email: `quotes@nxlevellandscaping.com`), a main navigation with a services dropdown, and mobile menu functionality.

The `CTASection.jsx` file, introduced at `12/18/2025, 3:17:56 PM`, defines a Call-to-Action section with a background image, a headline, descriptive text, and buttons for requesting an estimate (linking to `/contact`) and calling a specific phone number (`(702)-348-6380`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Contact Information Updates:** There is a strong pattern of updating phone numbers and email addresses across multiple components (`ThankYou.jsx`, `Contact.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`, `Navbar.jsx`, `CTASection.jsx`). The email address consistently converged to `quotes@nxlevellandscaping.com`, and the phone number moved towards `(702)-348-6380`, although `Navbar.jsx` still retained the older phone number in its top bar.
*   **Typeform Integration Evolution:** `Contact.jsx` demonstrates a clear evolution in integrating Typeform, transitioning from a basic script embed to a more robust, React-idiomatic integration using the `@typeform/embed` package and React hooks.
*   **Commenting for Control:** Large sections of code, particularly in `Contact.jsx` and `Footer.jsx`, were frequently commented out, suggesting active development, feature toggling, or temporary disabling of content.
*   **Shared Design System:** Components consistently use `heroImage` and common utility classes (e.g., `section-padding`, `container-custom`, `font-display`, `btn-hero`, `bg-card`, `border-border`), indicating a unified design approach.
*   **Navigation Flow:** `react-router-dom` is a core part of the application, handling navigation between pages like contact and thank you, and within the footer and navbar.
*   **Local Storage for Form Data:** `localStorage` is consistently used for client-side transfer of form data from the `Contact` page to the `ThankYou` page.
*   **Development Speed:** All changes occurred on the same day, `12/18/2025`, within a concentrated timeframe, implying focused development or debugging.
