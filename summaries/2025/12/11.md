# Activity Summary for 12/11/2025

## 10:23:54 AM
The provided log details code changes within the `IPSuite-Web` project, primarily focusing on a `WelcomeModal` component and its integration into a `Search` component, along with related data and styling. All significant changes occurred between December 10th and 11th, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\commonComponents\Modals\WelcomeModal.jsx`**

*   **12/10/2025, 5:40:47 PM:** An initial version of the `WelcomeModal` component was introduced. It's a React functional component utilizing `antd`'s `Modal` and `framer-motion` for animations, with content sourced from `welcomeModalData`. It includes responsive logic based on window width and a CTA button that can trigger navigation to `/demo`.
*   **12/10/2025, 8:24:34 PM & 8:25:44 PM:** The import path for `welcomeModalData` was initially incorrectly updated (`../../`), then quickly corrected to `../../../constants/WelcomeModalConstants`, demonstrating an adjustment to the project's file structure.
*   **12/10/2025, 8:35:11 PM:** The `framer-motion` imports (`motion`, `AnimatePresence`) and the `modalRender` prop (which applied `framer-motion` animations) were commented out. This change likely aimed to simplify the modal's rendering or remove animation dependencies.
*   **12/11/2025, 10:01:26 AM:** A major refactor of the `WelcomeModal` occurred. The component's JSX was largely rewritten to incorporate extensive mobile responsiveness, conditionally adjusting `width`, `padding`, `height`, `maxHeight`, `gap`, `flexDirection`, `gridTemplateColumns`, `rowGap`, and `columnGap` based on `isMobile`. The `modalRender` prop was reintroduced, but without the `framer-motion` animations, effectively replacing them with simpler responsive `div` styling. The `handleDemoClick` function was updated to solely call `onCtaClick()`, implying external handling of navigation.
*   **12/11/2025, 10:02:56 AM & 10:22:35 AM:** The `Modal` component was assigned the `className="welcome-modal-no-close"`, indicating a styling change to hide its default close button.
*   **12/11/2025, 9:58:37 AM:** A minor styling change increased the `maxWidth` of the CTA button from `200px` to `270px`.

**2. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\constants\WelcomeModalConstants.jsx`**

*   **12/10/2025, 5:58:26 PM:** This file was created to define `welcomeModalData`, an object containing structured data for three variants of a welcome modal (`TMWatch`, `TMManager`, `TMSearch`). Each variant includes a heading, subheading, CTA label, and a list of points with icons and descriptions. Initial icon paths pointed to `../../public/assets/IPSolutions/WelcomeModal/`.
*   **12/10/2025, 8:36:12 PM to 10:29:38 PM:** Several rapid changes were made to the icon import paths. Initially, `TMWatch1` was changed to an incomplete path (`../assets/images/`), then to a specific `clock.svg`. Subsequently, **all icons were temporarily set to import `clock.svg`**, indicating a likely placeholder or mass-replacement step.
*   **12/11/2025, 9:25:31 AM to 9:57:22 AM:** The icon paths underwent further refinement and correction. They were progressively updated from placeholder paths to more structured relative paths within `../assets/welcomeModal/`. There was a temporary error where `TMManager` icons incorrectly pointed to `TMSearch` assets or had incomplete paths, which was quickly rectified. The final change in this sequence ensured **all icon imports correctly pointed to their respective SVG files (e.g., `../assets/welcomeModal/TMWatch_1.svg`)**.

**3. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\components\searchComponents\Search.jsx`**

*   **12/10/2025, 8:31:30 PM:** The `WelcomeModal` component was imported into the `Search` class component, indicating its integration into the search feature.
*   **12/10/2025, 10:30:36 PM:** The `Search` component's state was updated to include `isWelcomeOpen: false`, a flag to control the visibility of the welcome modal.
*   **12/10/2025, 11:05:04 PM:** Logic was added to `componentDidMount` to manage `isWelcomeOpen` based on a `localStorage` key (`WelcomeModalDocCompare`). If the key's value is `'false'`, the modal is hidden; otherwise, it's shown.
*   **12/10/2025, 11:06:33 PM:** A `handleWelcomeCta` method was added. This method sets the `localStorage` key to `'false'` and updates the state to hide the modal, implementing a "don't show again" mechanism.
*   **12/10/2025, 11:22:40 PM:** A `console.log` statement was added to `componentDidMount` for debugging the welcome modal's visibility logic.
*   **12/10/2025, 11:44:02 PM:** The `localStorage` key used to store the modal's visibility preference was changed from `WelcomeModalDocCompare` to `WelcomeModalTMSearch`, making the preference specific to the TMSearch context.
*   Numerous minor saves/reformats occurred throughout the day, particularly between 8:29 PM and 8:30 PM, and again between 11:07 PM and 11:52 PM, often resulting in identical code content. There was a brief, erroneous import of `useState` in a class component which was later corrected.

**4. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\IPSuite-Web\src\stylesheets\App.css`**

*   **12/11/2025, 10:22:50 AM:** A new CSS rule `.welcome-modal-no-close .ant-modal-close-x { display: none !important; }` was added. This rule explicitly hides the close icon for any `antd` modal element that also has the `welcome-modal-no-close` class. This directly supports the styling change made in `WelcomeModal.jsx` at a similar timestamp.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Welcome Modal Development:** A central theme is the development and integration of a `WelcomeModal` component. This includes its visual design, responsiveness, content management, and user interaction (CTA, "don't show again" functionality).
*   **Refinement of File Paths:** There are recurring instances of relative import paths being adjusted, indicating active development and possible restructuring of asset or component locations.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** A significant pattern is the dedicated effort to make the `WelcomeModal` highly responsive, with many CSS properties dynamically adjusted based on screen size, utilizing `clamp()` functions and conditional styling.
*   **State Persistence with `localStorage`:** The implementation of a "don't show again" feature for the welcome modal uses `localStorage` to persist user preferences.
*   **Code Review and Debugging:** The addition of comments for "fixes" and a `console.log` statement indicates a cycle of development, testing, and debugging.
*   **Minor Saves/Formatting:** Numerous timestamps show identical or near-identical code, suggesting frequent saves or automated formatting, which can be common during active development.
*   **Ant Design and React Ecosystem:** The project consistently uses `antd` components and is built with React, along with other libraries like `framer-motion` (initially for animations, later simplified for responsiveness).

## 1:13:18 PM
The code changes primarily revolve around minor cleanups in configuration and testing files, and significant development and refinement of a `WelcomeModal` component within a Dashboard application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\jest.config.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 12/11/2025, 11:41:21 AM and 11:41:39 AM
    *   **Changes:** A stray string `jgghg` was removed from the end of the `jest.config.ts` file, indicating a minor cleanup or typo correction.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-mobile-e2e\src\support\app.po.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 12/11/2025, 11:41:54 AM and 11:42:10 AM
    *   **Changes:** Similar to the Jest config, a stray string `ghhg` was removed from the `app.po.js` file, also a minor cleanup.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\containers\Dashboard\Dashboard.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 12/11/2025, 12:27:06 PM to 12:53:21 PM
    *   **Changes:**
        *   **Initial setup:** The `Dashboard.jsx` component was initially structured to display various widgets like `Matrix`, `CalendarView`, `TodaysTask`, and `NewCases`, with conditional rendering based on `profileType`.
        *   **WelcomeModal Integration (12:27 PM):** The `WelcomeModal` component was imported.
        *   **State and Effect Logic (12:49 PM):** Introduced `useState` for `isWelcomeOpen` and `useEffect` to manage the modal's visibility based on a `localStorage` key (initially `'WelcomeModalDocCompare'`, later changed to `'WelcomeModalTMSearch'`). A handler `handleWelcomeCta` was added to close the modal and persist its state in `localStorage`.
        *   **Modal Rendering (12:50 PM):** The `WelcomeModal` was added to the render tree of the `Dashboard` component, passing its state and a `variant` prop (initially `"DocCompare"`, then `"TMSearch"`).
        *   **Explicit Hook Imports (12:53 PM):** `useState` and `useEffect` were explicitly imported from 'react'.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\Dashboard\WelcomeModal.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 12/11/2025, 12:29:31 PM to 12:55:17 PM
    *   **Changes:** This component underwent the most significant and rapid evolution.
        *   **Initial Comprehensive Definition (12:29 PM):** The component was created, defining `welcomeModalData` locally for `TMWatch`, `TMManager`, and `TMSearch` tools, each with detailed feature points and associated SVG icon imports. It also included extensive inline styling for a responsive Ant Design `Modal`. A minor typo in an import path (`TMWatch1 from ''`) was immediately corrected.
        *   **Refactoring for External Data (12:46 PM):** All local `welcomeModalData` definitions and direct SVG imports were removed, indicating a move to rely solely on the externally imported `welcomeModalData` from `../../../constants/WelcomeModalConstants`.
        *   **Reintroduction of Local Data & Responsiveness (12:48 PM):** The `welcomeModalData` for `TMSearch` was reintroduced locally, along with specific SVG imports for its icons. `useEffect` and `useState` were added to dynamically determine and manage `isMobile` state for responsive rendering.
        *   **Icon Import Path Adjustments (12:51 PM - 12:52 PM):** Icon import paths for `TMSearch` were frequently modified, first to an incomplete path (`../../assets/icons/`) and then consistently changed to a generic `QR.png` from `../../assets/QR.png`.
        *   **Content Change (12:54 PM):** The entire `welcomeModalData` object was modified to define a `Litigator` variant instead of `TMSearch`, introducing new content related to a "MikeLitigator" tool (case tracking, hearing reminders, keyword discovery, expense management), while still using the generic `QR.png` for its icons.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Minor Typo Corrections:** Early in the log, there are immediate fixes for stray characters in two separate files (`jest.config.ts`, `app.po.js`).
*   **Evolution of `WelcomeModal`:** The `WelcomeModal.jsx` file shows a continuous development process:
    *   **Data Management:** Shifting between local and external data definitions for `welcomeModalData`.
    *   **Responsiveness:** Implementation of dynamic screen size detection using React hooks.
    *   **Icon Handling:** Frequent changes in asset imports, transitioning from specific SVG files to a generic `QR.png` with path corrections.
    *   **Content Iteration:** The specific variant data being developed within the modal component changed from `TMWatch`/`TMManager`/`TMSearch` to `TMSearch` only, and then to `Litigator`.
*   **Dashboard Integration:** The `Dashboard.jsx` demonstrates the practical integration of the `WelcomeModal`, including logic for showing/hiding it based on user activity and `localStorage` persistence.
*   **React Hooks usage:** `useState` and `useEffect` are central to the new logic in both the `Dashboard` and `WelcomeModal` components for managing state and side effects. There was also a specific commit to explicitly import these hooks in `Dashboard.jsx` after they were introduced.

## 2:23:34 PM
`components/_constants/KnowMore.ts` (12/10/2025, 11:08:59 AM) introduces an `interface KnowMoreContent` and exports a `KNOW_MORE_CONTENT` object. This object centralizes detailed information for various MikeLegal products, including 'IPSuite', 'Litigator', 'DocReview', 'DocChat', 'DocCompare', and 'CLM'. Each product entry specifies a title, heading, feature points, and consistent contact information (`team@Mikelegal.com`, `9958915302`). Notably, only 'IPSuite' has specific feature points listed, while others have empty point arrays, suggesting areas for future content expansion.

`components/Common/WelcomeModal.tsx` (12/10/2025, 12:05:56 PM) details the implementation of a `WelcomeModal` React component. This component renders an animated modal dialog (`framer-motion`, `antd.Modal`) that dynamically displays content based on a `variant` prop (e.g., 'TMWatch', 'TMSearch', 'DocChat'), pulling data from `welcomeModalData`. The modal features a welcome heading, sub-heading, a list of points with icons and descriptions, and a "Request Demo" call-to-action linking to `/Demo`. It includes responsive styling for different screen sizes.

`components/Home/Navbar.tsx` (12/10/2025, 4:35:43 PM) describes updates to the application's main navigation bar. The `Navbar` component now incorporates Ant Design `Dropdown` menus for categorized links, including "IP Solutions" (listing TMWatch, TMSearch, TMManager, TMLens), "Contract Solutions" (listing DocReview, DocCompare, DocChat), and "Resources" (Case Studies, Blog, Media Mentions, Videos). Direct navigation links for "Litigation Solutions", "About Us", "Request Demo", and "Access Product" are also present. The component includes a mobile menu toggle and a `useEffect` hook to initialize `ChatUIHandler` and manage a page loader animation.

`components/_constants/home.ts` saw two rapid updates:
*   The first update (12/10/2025, 4:44:25 PM) introduced `ROOT_URL` as `'https://ipsuitedev.mikelegal.com/sign-in'`, imported numerous brand image assets, and defined `brandsIcons` (an array of client/partner logos with names and widths, including some commented-out duplicates) and `contractReview` data (a title and statistics on efficiency, time saved, and increased profits).
*   The subsequent update (12/10/2025, 4:44:49 PM) removed the `ROOT_URL` constant, while the brand image imports, `brandsIcons` array, and `contractReview` object remained unchanged.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
There's a strong pattern of organizing content around distinct MikeLegal products, often prefixed with "Mike" (e.g., MikeTM Watch, Mike DocReview). Contact and demo information, specifically the email `team@Mikelegal.com` and phone `9958915302` along with a `/Demo` link, is consistently provided across different product-related components and data structures. The use of constants files (`_constants`) for centralized data management, and the integration of Ant Design components (`Modal`, `Dropdown`) with Next.js features (`next/link`, `Image`), are prevalent across the changes. The rapid updates to `home.ts` suggest active development and refinement of static website data.

## 2:51:48 PM
The provided log details a series of code changes within the `CaseTrack-frontend` project, primarily focusing on React components for web and mobile applications, specifically involving SVG icons and a welcome modal. All recorded changes occurred on 12/11/2025 within a focused timeframe, from 2:13:20 PM to 2:46:39 PM.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\assets\RefreshIcon.jsx`**:
    *   Initially a functional React component exporting an SVG icon (12/11/2025, 2:13:20 PM).
    *   Underwent several minor syntax adjustments and corrections for its functional component definition (e.g., `(props) => { return (...) }` changed to `(props) => (...)`) between 2:15:35 PM and 2:16:14 PM.
    *   Changed from a named export (`export const RefreshIcon`) to a default export (`export default RefreshIcon`) around 2:18:34 PM, also adding a comment.
    *   The component was later modified to no longer accept `props` and removed `{...props}` from the SVG element, making it a static icon (12/11/2025, 2:28:37 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\Dashboard\WelcomeModal.jsx`**:
    *   The `WelcomeModal` component was introduced, importing `RefreshIcon` and multiple `QR.png` assets for its display points (12/11/2025, 2:13:42 PM). It is a responsive Ant Design modal.
    *   The import path for `RefreshIcon` was adjusted to remove the `.jsx` extension (12/11/2025, 2:14:28 PM).
    *   A significant change occurred around 2:19:39 PM, introducing conditional rendering for `point.icon` in the modal's display. This allowed `point.icon` to be either a string (for an `<img>` tag) or a React component (rendered directly as `<point.icon />`). This logic was temporarily reverted (2:20:32 PM) and then restored (2:21:00 PM onwards).
    *   All icon imports for `Litigator2`, `Litigator3`, and `Litigator4` were updated from `QR.png` to `RefreshIcon` (12/11/2025, 2:22:03 PM), indicating a design consistency change.
    *   Further updates were made to the icon imports, leading to `Litigator1` (RefreshIcon), `Litigator2` (CalenderIcon), `Litigator3` (DocIcon), and `Litigator4` (BagIcon) by 2:31:19 PM, reflecting the integration of new dedicated icon components.
    *   There were transient issues with icon rendering logic, where at 2:25:22 PM it briefly rendered an empty string instead of a component, which was then corrected by 2:25:38 PM. A typo in the import path for `Litigator2` (`RefreshIc`) was also corrected.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\containers\Dashboard\Dashboard.jsx`**:
    *   The `Dashboard` component was updated to integrate the `WelcomeModal`. It now manages the modal's visibility using a state variable (`isWelcomeOpen`) and leverages `localStorage` to ensure the modal is only shown once to a user (12/11/2025, 2:21:30 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-mobile\src\components\screens\Settings\Settings.js`**:
    *   The `Settings` component's `onLogout` function initially cleared various stores and storage mechanisms (12/11/2025, 2:41:50 PM).
    *   An attempt to explicitly preserve a specific `localStorage` item (`WelcomeModalTMManager`) during logout was introduced, but initially incomplete (12/11/2025, 2:42:15 PM).
    *   This logic was refined and fully implemented at 2:45:13 PM, where `onLogout` was updated to explicitly save a particular `localStorage` key (`WelcomeModalTMManager`), clear all `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, and then restore only the saved key.
    *   This specific `localStorage` preservation logic was later reverted, simplifying the `onLogout` function to clear only the Apollo and Redux stores and `asyncStorage` (12/11/2025, 2:46:39 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\src\assets\CalenderIcon.jsx`**:
    *   Initially contained raw SVG markup (12/11/2025, 2:26:41 PM).
    *   Was subsequently wrapped in a functional React component named `CalenderIcon` and exported as default (12/11/2025, 2:29:58 PM).
    *   The component was also made static by removing `props` from its signature (12/11/2025, 2:30:45 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\src\assets\DocIcon.jsx`**:
    *   Created as an empty functional component (12/11/2025, 2:29:30 PM).
    *   The actual SVG markup for a document icon was added to it shortly after (12/11/2025, 2:29:37 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\src\assets\BagIcon.jsx`**:
    *   Was initially created with the incorrect SVG content, copying the `CalenderIcon` SVG and internal component name (12/11/2025, 2:30:40 PM).
    *   The SVG content was corrected to a shopping bag icon (12/11/2025, 2:31:09 PM), but the internal component name remained `CalenderIcon`, indicating a potential naming inconsistency in the file.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\node_modules\@apollo\client\core\ApolloClient.d.ts`**:
    *   This file represents an update to the Apollo Client type definitions, specifically for the `ApolloClientOptions` interface, highlighting deprecated options and recommendations for version 4.0 (12/11/2025, 2:42:05 PM). This is a dependency-related update, not application code.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Icon Component Standardization**: There is a clear pattern of creating and refining dedicated React functional components for SVG icons (`RefreshIcon`, `CalenderIcon`, `DocIcon`, `BagIcon`). These icons are initially raw SVG, then encapsulated in React components, and sometimes made static (removing props).
*   **Dynamic Icon Rendering**: The `WelcomeModal.jsx` component consistently evolves to support dynamic rendering of these new icon components, moving from simple image paths to conditional logic that can render either `<img>` tags or React components.
*   **`localStorage` Interaction**: Both `Dashboard.jsx` (for `WelcomeModalLitigator`) and `Settings.js` (for `WelcomeModalTMManager` during logout) demonstrate a recurring pattern of using `localStorage` to persist user preferences or application state, particularly related to welcome modals or session management. There was a notable effort to fine-tune the `localStorage` clearing strategy during logout in the mobile settings.
*   **Rapid Iteration/Debugging**: The close proximity of timestamps (e.g., several changes to `RefreshIcon.jsx` and `WelcomeModal.jsx` within minutes) suggests rapid iteration, debugging, and refinement of the icon components and their integration.
