# Activity Summary for 12/12/2025

## 9:36:37 AM
The log details development activity on a backend project, primarily focusing on Mongoose schema and database connection setup, with timestamps from 12/12/2025 in the early morning.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Backend_Practice1\Modal\User.js`**
    *   Observed at 12:52:36 AM and 12:52:46 AM, this file defines a Mongoose schema for a `User` model.
    *   The schema includes fields for `name`, `email`, `password` (all required strings), `role` (string with "user" and "admin" enum, defaulting to "user"), and `createdAt` (date, defaulting to `Date.now`).
    *   The model is exported as `User`, though there's a minor typo in the model name within `mongoose.model('Usser', userSchema)`. The content remained consistent across the two logged timestamps.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Backend_Practice1\config\db.js`**
    *   Logged at 12:57:19 AM, this file provides a utility function `connectMongoDb` to establish a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose.
    *   It retrieves the MongoDB URI from `process.env.MONGODB_URI` and includes error handling, logging connection success or failure, and exiting the process on connection errors.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Backend_Practice1\Modal\Product.js`**
    *   This file shows a gradual development process captured through multiple timestamps between 1:02:00 AM and 1:33:42 AM.
    *   Initially, the file started with just the `mongoose` import and the beginning of a constant declaration (1:02:00 AM).
    *   It progressively built up the `productSchema` definition (1:02:32 AM, 1:09:20 AM for an empty schema object).
    *   The export statement for the `Product` model was then constructed incrementally (1:09:33 AM, 1:09:53 AM, 1:10:04 AM, 1:10:17 AM).
    *   The final state at 1:33:42 AM shows a complete export of an empty `Product` Mongoose schema: `export const Product = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema)`. This indicates the basic structure is in place, with fields expected to be added later.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Mongoose Usage:** All `.js` files in the `Modal` directory and the `db.js` configuration file heavily utilize Mongoose for defining schemas, models, and connecting to the database.
*   **Standard Mongoose Schema Structure:** Both `User.js` and `Product.js` follow the pattern of `import mongoose from "mongoose";`, defining a schema with `new mongoose.Schema({})`, and exporting the model using `export const ModelName = mongoose.model('ModelName', schemaName)`.
*   **Incremental Development:** The `Product.js` log entries particularly highlight an iterative development style, with many small saves as code lines or components are added piece by piece.
*   **Timestamp Clustering:** All significant changes occur within a short period, specifically between 12:52 AM and 1:33 AM on December 12, 2025, suggesting a single concentrated development session.
*   **Backend Setup:** The changes collectively point to the initial setup phase of a Node.js backend application, focusing on database connection and defining core data models (User, Product).
