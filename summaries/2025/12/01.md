# Activity Summary for 12/1/2025

## 11:16:43 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js` underwent several updates.

On **11/29/2025, 1:45:30 PM**, the file established a comprehensive Express server for an e-commerce API. Key features included:
*   **Security & Middleware**: `helmet`, `cors` (with a defined list of allowed origins including Netlify and localhost domains), `morgan` for logging, `express.json` and `express.urlencoded` for body parsing.
*   **Rate Limiting**: A global rate limiter (100 requests per 15 minutes) was configured, along with specific, stricter rate limits for `/api/auth/login` (5 attempts per 15 minutes) and `/api/auth/signup` (3 attempts per 60 minutes).
*   **API Documentation**: Integrated Swagger UI at `/api-docs`.
*   **Routes**: Defined routes for authentication, users, categories, products, support, Razorpay payments, and orders.
*   **Static Files**: Served static files from an `uploads` folder.
*   **Database Connection**: Connected to a database via `connectDatabase`.
*   **Error Handling**: Included custom middleware for `MulterError` (with a 5MB file size limit) and a general `errorHandler`.
*   **Server Startup**: Listened on a port configured from `env.js` and logged server status and API documentation URL.

The entry on **11/29/2025, 1:46:54 PM** shows no functional changes to the code; it is identical to the previous timestamp.

A significant update occurred on **12/1/2025, 10:18:00 AM**:
*   **CORS Configuration**: A new origin, `https://tanariry-user.netlify.app`, was added to the `allowedOrigins` array, expanding the list of permitted frontends.
*   **Rate Limiting Adjustment**: The global rate limiter, previously set for 100 requests per 15 minutes, was commented out and effectively disabled. However, the specific rate limiters for `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/signup` remained active.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The code consistently sets up a robust Express application with a focus on API development. Recurring elements include the use of common security and logging middleware (`helmet`, `cors`, `morgan`), a structured approach to API routing, and dedicated error handling mechanisms. The presence of multiple rate limiters (even if one was later disabled) indicates a strong emphasis on protecting API endpoints from abuse. The `allowedOrigins` list for CORS frequently includes Netlify and localhost domains, suggesting development and deployment to Netlify platforms.
