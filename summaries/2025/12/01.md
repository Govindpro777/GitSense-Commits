# Activity Summary for 12/1/2025

## 11:16:43 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js` underwent several updates.

On **11/29/2025, 1:45:30 PM**, the file established a comprehensive Express server for an e-commerce API. Key features included:
*   **Security & Middleware**: `helmet`, `cors` (with a defined list of allowed origins including Netlify and localhost domains), `morgan` for logging, `express.json` and `express.urlencoded` for body parsing.
*   **Rate Limiting**: A global rate limiter (100 requests per 15 minutes) was configured, along with specific, stricter rate limits for `/api/auth/login` (5 attempts per 15 minutes) and `/api/auth/signup` (3 attempts per 60 minutes).
*   **API Documentation**: Integrated Swagger UI at `/api-docs`.
*   **Routes**: Defined routes for authentication, users, categories, products, support, Razorpay payments, and orders.
*   **Static Files**: Served static files from an `uploads` folder.
*   **Database Connection**: Connected to a database via `connectDatabase`.
*   **Error Handling**: Included custom middleware for `MulterError` (with a 5MB file size limit) and a general `errorHandler`.
*   **Server Startup**: Listened on a port configured from `env.js` and logged server status and API documentation URL.

The entry on **11/29/2025, 1:46:54 PM** shows no functional changes to the code; it is identical to the previous timestamp.

A significant update occurred on **12/1/2025, 10:18:00 AM**:
*   **CORS Configuration**: A new origin, `https://tanariry-user.netlify.app`, was added to the `allowedOrigins` array, expanding the list of permitted frontends.
*   **Rate Limiting Adjustment**: The global rate limiter, previously set for 100 requests per 15 minutes, was commented out and effectively disabled. However, the specific rate limiters for `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/signup` remained active.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The code consistently sets up a robust Express application with a focus on API development. Recurring elements include the use of common security and logging middleware (`helmet`, `cors`, `morgan`), a structured approach to API routing, and dedicated error handling mechanisms. The presence of multiple rate limiters (even if one was later disabled) indicates a strong emphasis on protecting API endpoints from abuse. The `allowedOrigins` list for CORS frequently includes Netlify and localhost domains, suggesting development and deployment to Netlify platforms.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js`**

*   **11/29/2025, 1:45:30 PM**: The initial version of the server configuration was logged. This version established a robust Express server utilizing various middleware for security (`helmet`, `cors`, `express-rate-limit`), logging (`morgan`), and data parsing (`express.json`, `express.urlencoded`). It set up both a global rate limiter (100 requests per 15 minutes) and specific rate limits for `/api/auth/login` (5 requests per 15 minutes) and `/api/auth/signup` (3 requests per hour). CORS was configured to allow specific origins, including `netlify.app` and `vercel.app` domains, along with `localhost` development environments. Swagger UI was integrated for API documentation at `/api-docs`. The server also included static file serving for an `/uploads` folder and defined numerous API routes for authentication, users, categories, products, support, Razorpay, and orders. Comprehensive error handling was implemented, covering 404 Not Found, `multer` specific errors (like file size limits), and a custom error handler.
*   **11/29/2025, 1:46:54 PM**: No functional changes were observed in the code content compared to the previous entry.
*   **12/1/2025, 10:18:00 AM**: Significant updates were made:
    *   A new origin, `https://tanariry-user.netlify.app`, was added to the `allowedOrigins` array for CORS, expanding the list of authorized frontends.
    *   The global `express-rate-limit` middleware, which previously limited all requests to 100 per 15 minutes, was commented out and thus effectively disabled. The specific rate limits for `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/signup` remained active.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

Across the logged changes for `server.js`, a consistent pattern of setting up a secure and maintainable API emerges:
*   **Security Focus:** Persistent use of `helmet` for various HTTP headers, detailed CORS configuration, and initial implementation of rate limiting demonstrates a strong emphasis on API security.
*   **Modularity:** The server utilizes dedicated route files for different functionalities (e.g., `authRoutes`, `userRoutes`, `productRoutes`), indicating a modular and scalable design.
*   **Developer Experience:** Integration of `morgan` for logging and `swagger-ui-express` for API documentation suggests a focus on ease of development and API consumption.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust and layered error handling, including specific Multer error management and a custom error middleware, is consistently applied.
*   **E-commerce Specifics:** The presence of routes like `productRoutes`, `categoryRoutes`, `orderRoutes`, and `razorpayRoutes` clearly identifies the application's domain.
