The provided log details changes to a single file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`.

**File-Specific Updates & Timestamps:**

*   **12/19/2025, 12:42:51 PM:** The `FileManager.jsx` component was present and fully functional. This component is responsible for managing case-related documents. Key functionalities include:
    *   Fetching existing documents (`fetchData`).
    *   Uploading files to S3 via signed URLs (`getSignedUrl`, `uploadFile`), supporting both individual files and directories.
    *   Displaying upload progress and status (uploading, completed, failed) using `UploadProgressBar`.
    *   Allowing re-uploading of failed files (`handleReUpload`) and canceling ongoing uploads (`handleCancel`) using `AbortController`.
    *   Downloading all files associated with a case (`onDownloadAll`).
    *   Utilizing `antd` components (Button, Upload, message), Redux for user data, and custom utilities for tracking events, date conversion, and error handling.
    *   Checking online status before enabling upload/download buttons.

*   **12/19/2025, 4:34:57 PM:** The *entire* content of the `FileManager.jsx` file was commented out. This effectively deactivated the component, rendering it non-functional.

*   **12/19/2025, 4:35:37 PM:** The `FileManager.jsx` file was restored to its original, uncommented state, which is identical to the version from 12:42:51 PM. This means the component's functionality was fully reinstated.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The most notable pattern is the complete commenting out of the `FileManager.jsx` component at 4:34:57 PM, followed almost immediately (within 40 seconds) by its full restoration at 4:35:37 PM. This suggests a brief, temporary deactivation or an accidental change that was quickly reverted. The core functionality of the `FileManager` component, focused on comprehensive document upload, management, and download features, remains consistent in the active versions of the code.
