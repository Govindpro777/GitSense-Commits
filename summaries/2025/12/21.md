# Activity Summary for 12/21/2025

## 1:11:46 PM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx`.

**File-Specific Updates & Timestamps:**

*   **12/19/2025, 12:42:51 PM:** The `FileManager.jsx` component was present and fully functional. This component is responsible for managing case-related documents. Key functionalities include:
    *   Fetching existing documents (`fetchData`).
    *   Uploading files to S3 via signed URLs (`getSignedUrl`, `uploadFile`), supporting both individual files and directories.
    *   Displaying upload progress and status (uploading, completed, failed) using `UploadProgressBar`.
    *   Allowing re-uploading of failed files (`handleReUpload`) and canceling ongoing uploads (`handleCancel`) using `AbortController`.
    *   Downloading all files associated with a case (`onDownloadAll`).
    *   Utilizing `antd` components (Button, Upload, message), Redux for user data, and custom utilities for tracking events, date conversion, and error handling.
    *   Checking online status before enabling upload/download buttons.

*   **12/19/2025, 4:34:57 PM:** The *entire* content of the `FileManager.jsx` file was commented out. This effectively deactivated the component, rendering it non-functional.

*   **12/19/2025, 4:35:37 PM:** The `FileManager.jsx` file was restored to its original, uncommented state, which is identical to the version from 12:42:51 PM. This means the component's functionality was fully reinstated.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The most notable pattern is the complete commenting out of the `FileManager.jsx` component at 4:34:57 PM, followed almost immediately (within 40 seconds) by its full restoration at 4:35:37 PM. This suggests a brief, temporary deactivation or an accidental change that was quickly reverted. The core functionality of the `FileManager` component, focused on comprehensive document upload, management, and download features, remains consistent in the active versions of the code.

## 2:11:46 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\CaseTrack-frontend\apps\casetrack-web\src\components\case_status\FileManager.jsx` details a React component named `FileManager`. This component is responsible for managing file uploads and downloads within a case management system.

**Key functionalities observed in the active versions (12/19/2025, 12:42:51 PM and 12/19/2025, 4:35:37 PM):**

*   **File Uploads:** Supports uploading single files and entire directories. It uses Ant Design's `Upload` component and `axios` for API interactions.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Implements an `UploadProgressBar` to show real-time upload progress for multiple files, including "Uploading," "Completed," and "Failed" statuses.
*   **S3 Integration:** Files are uploaded to an S3-compatible service using signed URLs obtained from a backend API (`getSignedUrl`).
*   **Cancellation and Re-upload:** Users can cancel ongoing uploads using `AbortController` and re-upload failed or cancelled files.
*   **File Data Management:** Fetches existing document data for a specific case ID (`management_case_id`) and updates it upon successful uploads.
*   **Download All:** Provides functionality to download all associated files for a case.
*   **User Interface:** Uses Ant Design components (`Button`, `Upload`, `message`) and custom icons (`FileIcon`, `UploadFilled`, `DownloadFileOutlined`).
*   **State Management:** Utilizes `useState`, `useRef`, and `useSelector` (Redux) to manage component state, file lists, upload statuses, and user data.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes `handleAxiosError` for centralized error management during API calls.
*   **Online Status Check:** Uses a `useOnlineStatus` hook to enable/disable buttons based on network connectivity.
*   **Event Tracking:** Integrates `trackWeb` for analytics, specifically tracking button clicks for file and directory uploads.

**Significant Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **12/19/2025, 12:42:51 PM:** The component was fully functional, handling all the features mentioned above.
*   **12/19/2025, 4:34:57 PM:** The *entire* `FileManager.jsx` component, including all imports, state declarations, functions, and JSX, was commented out. This effectively rendered the component inactive and inaccessible.
*   **12/19/2025, 4:35:37 PM:** Within a minute of being commented out, the entire `FileManager.jsx` component was uncommented, restoring it to its original functional state, identical to the 12:42:51 PM version.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

The primary pattern observed is the consistent functionality of the `FileManager` component across its active states. The content indicates a robust client-side file management system with progress tracking, API integration, and user interaction capabilities. The most significant pattern in the log itself is the brief but complete deactivation (commenting out) and immediate reactivation (uncommenting) of the entire component, suggesting a temporary debugging step or an accidental commit/revert during development.
