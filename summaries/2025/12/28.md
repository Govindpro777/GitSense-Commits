# Activity Summary for 12/28/2025

## 3:30:27 PM
The provided log details a series of significant code changes primarily focused on user management, psychologist profiles, authentication, and file uploads within a Node.js backend application.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\routes\reportRoutes.js` (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 1:17:35 PM)**
*   Initial setup of API routes for reports.
*   Includes routes for users to create (`POST /`), list their own reports (`GET /mine`), and delete (`DELETE /:id`).
*   Admin/Superadmin specific routes are defined for listing all reports (`GET /admin`) and updating report status (`PATCH /:id/status`).
*   Middleware for authentication, authorization, and request body validation (`reportCreateSchema`, `reportStatusUpdateSchema`) is integrated.

**2. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\controllers\psychologistController.js`**
*   **Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 1:27:34 PM**
    *   This initial version defines core business logic for psychologist management.
    *   Includes public endpoints for listing psychologists (with and without filters), public application, retrieving by ID, and getting reviews.
    *   Authenticated endpoints for users to add/update reviews, and for psychologists to manage their own profile (`getMyProfile`, `updateMyProfile`).
    *   Contains helper functions for time normalization and checking slot overlaps.
*   **Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 1:56:43 PM**
    *   Refactored the helper functions into class methods.
    *   Standardized method names (e.g., `publicApply` to `applyPublic`, `getAllWithoutFilter` to `getAllNoFilter`, `addReview` to `postReview`, `getMyProfile` to `getProfileMe`, `updateMyProfile` to `updateProfileMe`). This update aligns the controller with the new route structure.

**3. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\routes\psychologistRoutes.js`**
*   **Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 1:27:54 PM**
    *   This version initially contained *inline* async function handlers for public and authenticated psychologist routes, demonstrating a tight coupling of logic within the route file itself.
*   **Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 1:30:09 PM**
    *   Underwent a major refactoring to adopt a cleaner MVC pattern by *delegating all route logic to the `psychologistController`*.
    *   Significantly expanded the API surface by adding numerous routes:
        *   New public routes for psychologist slots (`GET /:id/slots`, `GET /:psychologistId/slots/:slotId`).
        *   Extensive authenticated routes for psychologists to manage their profile, slots (`POST /profile/me/slots`, `PUT /profile/me/slots/:slotId`, `DELETE /profile/me/slots/:slotId`), account deactivation (`DELETE /profile/me`), and session management (listing sessions, history, reports, prescriptions, sending confirmation emails).
        *   Comprehensive admin routes for managing psychologists (listing, getting by ID, updating status, creating, updating, deleting psychologists, and deleting psychologist slots, getting session history by psychologist ID).
*   **Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 1:58:10 PM - 2:09:34 PM**
    *   Adjusted route definitions to correctly call the *renamed* methods in the `psychologistController` (e.g., `psychologistController.applyPublic` instead of `psychologistController.publicApply`). The functional routes remained largely the same as the prior major refactor.
*   **Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 2:17:05 PM**
    *   **Introduced `multer` for file uploads.** Setup included defining upload directories (`uploads/profiles`, `uploads/documents`), disk storage configuration, and file filtering (image for profile, various document types for others).
    *   The `POST /public/apply` route was updated to include the `uploadFiles` multer middleware, allowing new psychologist applications to submit files.
*   **Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 2:20:17 PM**
    *   Extended file upload capabilities by adding `uploadFiles` multer middleware to the `PUT /profile/me` route, enabling authenticated psychologists to update their profile with files.
*   **Timestamps: 12/27/2025, 4:12:07 PM - 4:13:08 PM**
    *   Further extended file upload integration by adding `uploadFiles` multer middleware to the admin routes for creating (`POST /`) and updating (`PUT /:id([a-fA-F0-9]{24})`) psychologist profiles.

**4. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\app.js` (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 5:25:54 PM)**
*   Configured the main Express application.
*   Implemented security measures (`helmet`, `cors`), logging (`morgan`), compression, and rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`) for API calls.
*   Defined a list of `allowedOrigins` for CORS, including various local and production domains.
*   Set up static file serving for `/uploads` and `/public` directories, crucial for accessing uploaded content.
*   Integrated Swagger documentation.
*   Included a health check endpoint and global error handling middleware.

**5. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\index.js` (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 5:26:04 PM)**
*   A basic entry point, only logging the Node.js version.

**6. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\scripts\setup-uploads.js` (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 5:28:44 PM)**
*   A utility script to programmatically create various upload directories (`thumbnails`, `audios`, `videos`, `podcast_thumbnails`, `profile_images`, `documents`) on application startup if they don't already exist, ensuring file storage readiness.

**7. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\routes\index.js`**
*   **Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 5:40:58 PM**
    *   The central route aggregator, importing and mounting numerous route modules (`authRoutes`, `userRoutes`, `psychologistRoutes`, `reportRoutes`, `bookingRoutes`, etc.) under the `/api` prefix.
    *   Includes a health check specific to the API router.
*   **Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 5:48:07 PM**
    *   **Removed `appointmentRoutes`** from the central route aggregation, suggesting a reevaluation or relocation of appointment-related functionalities.

**8. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\controllers\authController.js` (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 9:07:13 PM)**
*   Significantly enhanced authentication and registration logic.
*   Introduced a comprehensive **parental consent flow** for users under 18, including `initiateParentConsent`, `verifyParentEmailOTP`, `verifyParentContactOTP`, and `resendParentOTP` methods.
*   Implemented an **admin invitation process** with `inviteAdmin` (generating a temporary token) and `verifyAdminInvite` (creating the admin user upon token verification).
*   The `signup` and `verifyEmailOTP` methods now explicitly handle the `requiresParentConsent` flag and conditionally auto-login users based on age.
*   Standardized validation, OTP generation/verification, and error responses.

**9. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\services\authService.js`**
*   **Timestamp: 12/28/2025, 12:34:30 PM**
    *   Contains the core business logic for authentication and user management.
    *   The `register` method now uses a `PendingUser` model and generates a `tempToken` for multi-step verification. It sends contact and email OTPs and indicates if parent consent is needed.
    *   The `login` method verifies credentials, checks for email/contact verification and parent consent, and generates a JWT with `roleId` if applicable.
    *   OTP sending and verification methods (`sendContactOTP`, `sendEmailOTP`, `verifyContactOTP`, `verifyEmailOTP`) are detailed, handling OTP expiry and account creation for verified `PendingUser`s.
    *   The `verifyEmailOTP` method is crucial, creating the final `User` account and conditionally logging in (for 18+) or flagging for parent consent (for under 18).
    *   Includes `initiateParentConsent` (partially shown) for the new parent consent flow.
*   **Timestamp: 12/28/2025, 12:54:02 PM**
    *   Identical to the previous version; no functional changes.

**10. `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\routes\userRoutes.js`**
*   **Timestamp: 12/28/2025, 1:09:57 PM**
    *   Underwent a major overhaul. The previous extensive routes (commented out) were replaced with a more focused set.
    *   Consolidated file upload setup (profiles, docx) into a single `multer` instance.
    *   Routes now focus on user document uploads (`POST /me/docx`) and streamlined admin management for users (listing, status updates, document verification, deleting users, getting user details).
    *   Psychologist-specific update routes appear to have been removed from this file in this version.
*   **Timestamp: 12/28/2025, 1:22:11 PM**
    *   **Reverted** some of the refactoring from 1:09:57 PM. The file upload configuration was split back into separate `profileImageStorage` and `docxStorage` and their respective `multer` instances (`uploadProfileImage`, `uploadDocx`).
    *   **Re-introduced** specific routes that were previously removed, namely `PUT /admin/:id` (admin update user profile) and `PUT /psychologist/me` (psychologist update own profile), indicating a shift in route ownership or a re-evaluation of the refactoring.
*   **Timestamp: 12/28/2025, 1:24:31 PM**
    *   A minor refinement from 1:22:11 PM, where `profileImageStorage` and `imageFilter` functions were commented out, leaving only `docxStorage` and `docxFilter` as active file upload configurations within this route file. The active routes remained consistent with the 1:22:11 PM version.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **MVC Refactoring:** A clear and consistent effort to move business logic from route handlers into dedicated controller methods is evident, particularly in the evolution of `psychologistRoutes.js` and `psychologistController.js`.
2.  **Robust Authentication & Authorization:** The application extensively uses `authenticate` and `authorize` middleware, enforcing role-based access control (user, psychologist, admin, superadmin) across numerous endpoints.
3.  **Comprehensive User Onboarding and Verification:** The `authController` and `authService` show a detailed multi-step user registration and verification process involving contact and email OTPs, temporary tokens, and explicit handling for parental consent for underage users.
4.  **File Upload Functionality:** `multer` is consistently integrated across different routes (`psychologistRoutes.js`, `userRoutes.js`) to handle file uploads such as profile images, Aadhar documents, and other verification documents. This includes dynamic file naming, destination management, and MIME type validation.
5.  **Admin and Role-Specific Management:** Dedicated routes and controller methods are implemented for administrative tasks, including listing, creating, updating (status, profile), and deleting various entities (reports, psychologists, users). Psychologists also have self-service routes for managing their profiles and availability (slots).
6.  **Pagination and Filtering:** Listing endpoints (e.g., fetching psychologists) consistently implement pagination and filtering capabilities to manage large datasets efficiently.
7.  **Standardized Responses and Error Handling:** The use of `successResponse` and `errorResponse` utilities, coupled with `logger` for error reporting, ensures consistent API responses and robust error management.
8.  **Infrastructure for Uploads:** The `app.js` configuration to serve static files from `/uploads` and the `setup-uploads.js` script to ensure directory existence highlight the importance of persistent file storage for the application.
9.  **Continuous Route Refinement:** The multiple updates to `userRoutes.js` (refactor, partial revert, further refinement) indicate an ongoing process of organizing and streamlining API endpoints for better maintainability and logical separation.
10. **Use of UUIDs:** `uuidv4` is used to generate temporary tokens, particularly for verification processes like registration and admin invites.

## 6:11:57 PM
The provided log details changes across several files in the `kidmantree-backend` project, primarily focusing on `psychologistRoutes.js`, `psychologistController.js`, `reportRoutes.js`, `authController.js`, `authService.js`, `userRoutes.js`, `userController.js`, and general application setup files (`app.js`, `index.js`, `scripts\setup-uploads.js`).

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\routes\reportRoutes.js`** (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 1:17:35 PM)
    *   This file defines API routes for reports.
    *   It includes routes for users to create (`POST /`), list their own (`GET /mine`), and delete (`DELETE /:id`) reports.
    *   Admin/Superadmin roles have routes to list all reports (`GET /admin`) and update a report's status (`PATCH /:id/status`).
    *   Middlewares `authenticate`, `authorize`, and `validate` are used, indicating authentication, authorization, and input validation are enforced.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\controllers\psychologistController.js`** (Timestamps: 12/27/2025, 1:27:34 PM and 1:56:43 PM)
    *   **Initial Change (1:27:34 PM):** Contains numerous functions for managing psychologist data, including:
        *   Public access: `getAll` (with filters), `getAllWithoutFilter`, `publicApply` (to become a psychologist), `getById`, `getReviews`.
        *   Authenticated users: `addReview`.
        *   Authenticated psychologists: `getMyProfile`, `updateMyProfile` (incomplete in log).
        *   Helper functions like `getMeetingLink`, `normalizeTime`, `timeToMinutes`, `isOverlapping` are also defined.
    *   **Later Change (1:56:43 PM):** This update refactors the functions into a `PsychologistController` class, making them class methods (e.g., `publicApply` becomes `applyPublic`, `addReview` becomes `postReview`, `getMyProfile` becomes `getProfileMe`, `updateMyProfile` becomes `updateProfileMe`). It suggests a move towards a more organized, class-based controller architecture. The list of methods is expanded, but the core logic for many remains similar to the initial entry.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\routes\psychologistRoutes.js`** (Numerous timestamps between 12/27/2025, 1:27:54 PM and 4:13:08 PM)
    *   This file undergoes significant evolution, demonstrating a progressive refactoring and expansion.
    *   **Initial versions (1:27:54 PM, 1:30:09 PM):** Start by directly implementing route logic (anonymous async functions) and then transition to using controller methods. The 1:30:09 PM version largely shifts to using `psychologistController` methods for public, authenticated user, and psychologist-authenticated routes, and introduces extensive admin routes for managing psychologists and their slots/sessions. This version also includes commented-out old code at the end.
    *   **Subsequent updates (1:58:10 PM, 2:09:34 PM, 2:17:05 PM, 2:17:15 PM, 2:17:20 PM, 2:20:17 PM, 2:20:42 PM, 2:26:06 PM, 4:12:07 PM, 4:12:12 PM, 4:12:59 PM, 4:13:08 PM):**
        *   Introduce `multer` for handling file uploads (profile images, Aadhar documents, other documents).
        *   Setup logic for creating `uploads`, `profiles`, and `documents` directories if they don't exist.
        *   Define `multer.diskStorage` for customizing file destination and filename.
        *   Implement `imageFilter` and `documentFilter` functions to restrict file types.
        *   Integrate `uploadFiles` multer middleware into routes like `POST /public/apply`, `PUT /profile/me`, `POST /`, and `PUT /:id([a-fA-F0-9]{24})` for psychologists and admin.
        *   The file shows repeated identical content in multiple timestamps, suggesting frequent saves or minor, unlogged changes not captured in the diff. The core structure and routes remain consistent across these repeated entries after the initial major refactoring to use controller methods and the introduction of multer.
        *   Old inline route logic and direct database interactions are replaced with calls to `psychologistController` methods, e.g., `psychologistController.getAll`, `psychologistController.applyPublic`, `psychologistController.postReview`, etc.
        *   Admin routes for creating and updating psychologists (e.g., `POST /` and `PUT /:id`) also now include `uploadFiles` middleware, enabling file uploads for these actions.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\app.js`** (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 5:25:54 PM)
    *   Configures the main Express application.
    *   Includes security middlewares like `helmet` and `cors` with a specific `allowedOrigins` list (localhost, manmitr.com, render.com deployments).
    *   Implements `express-rate-limit` for `/api` routes.
    *   Uses `compression` and body parsers (`express.json`, `express.urlencoded`).
    *   Sets up `morgan` for logging requests.
    *   Serves static files from `/uploads` and `/public`.
    *   Integrates all API routes under `/api` using `require("./src/routes")`.
    *   Sets up Swagger documentation.
    *   Includes health check endpoint and global error handlers (`notFoundHandler`, `errorHandler`).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\index.js`** (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 5:26:04 PM)
    *   A very minimal file, only logging the Node.js version. Suggests this might be an entry point or a simple test file, not central to the API logic itself.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\scripts\setup-uploads.js`** (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 5:28:44 PM)
    *   A utility script to ensure various `uploads` subdirectories (`thumbnails`, `audios`, `videos`, `podcast_thumbnails`, `profile_images`, `documents`) exist. This is a common practice for file storage in Node.js applications.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\routes\index.js`** (Timestamps: 12/27/2025, 5:40:58 PM and 5:48:07 PM)
    *   Consolidates all feature-specific route modules (`authRoutes`, `userRoutes`, `psychologistRoutes`, `reportRoutes`, etc.) under a single `/api` router.
    *   The later change (5:48:07 PM) removes `appointmentRoutes` from the imported and used routes, indicating that appointments might be handled elsewhere or were temporarily removed from the main router.
    *   Includes a health check for the API.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\controllers\authController.js`** (Timestamp: 12/27/2025, 9:07:13 PM)
    *   Manages user authentication and registration flows.
    *   Includes methods for `signup`, `verifyContactOTP`, `verifyEmailOTP`, `login`, and `resendOTP`.
    *   Crucially, it handles parent consent for users under 18, with methods like `initiateParentConsent`, `verifyParentEmailOTP`, `verifyParentContactOTP`, and `resendParentOTP`.
    *   Also includes functionality for `inviteAdmin` and `verifyAdminInvite` for managing administrative users.
    *   Uses `authService` for core logic and `joi` schemas (`signupSchema`, `loginSchema`, `otpSchema`) for validation.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\services\authService.js`** (Timestamps: 12/28/2025, 12:34:30 PM and 12:54:02 PM)
    *   Provides core authentication logic.
    *   Methods include `generateToken`, `verifyToken`, `register`, `login`, `sendContactOTP`, `sendEmailOTP`, `verifyContactOTP`, `verifyEmailOTP`, `resendOTP`, `initiateParentConsent`.
    *   Handles user creation in `User` and `PendingUser` models, password hashing, OTP generation and expiry, and integration with `emailService` and `smsService`.
    *   The `verifyEmailOTP` logic determines if a user is under 18, requiring parent consent, or if they can be auto-logged in.
    *   The two changes are identical, suggesting a frequent save or a revert to a previous state that was already logged.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\routes\userRoutes.js`** (Timestamps: 12/28/2025, 1:09:57 PM, 1:22:11 PM, and 1:24:31 PM)
    *   **Major Refactoring (1:09:57 PM):** The file transitions from a heavily commented-out previous version (which was more verbose and included direct Multer setup and specific user/psychologist update routes) to a much cleaner and more modular design.
        *   Moves `multer` setup (storage, filters, upload middleware) into dedicated sections for clarity.
        *   Defines `profileDir` and `docxDir` for uploads.
        *   Introduces a generic `upload` multer instance configured for both `avatar` and `docx` file types.
        *   Removes psychologist-specific routes from `userRoutes`, likely moving them to `psychologistRoutes`.
        *   Focuses on admin routes for user management (`adminListUsers`, `adminSetUserActiveStatus`, `adminUpdateDocxVerification`, `adminDeleteUserAndRole`, `getUserDetails`) and a user route for `userUploadDocx`.
    *   **Minor Edits (1:22:11 PM, 1:24:31 PM):** These appear to be minor adjustments or saves. The 1:22:11 PM change brings back most of the commented-out old code, making the file significantly larger and more verbose, suggesting a temporary reversion or an attempt to restore old functionality. The 1:24:31 PM change largely repeats the content of 1:22:11 PM but comments out `profileImageStorage` and `imageFilter` in the Multer configuration. This indicates ongoing work and perhaps indecision on how to structure the upload middleware within this file, specifically for profile images.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\src\controllers\userController.js`** (Timestamp: 12/28/2025, 4:00:40 PM)
    *   Implements logic for user management, particularly for admin roles.
    *   Methods include `adminUpdateDocxVerification` (to update verification status of user-uploaded documents), `adminListUsers` (with filtering and pagination), `adminSetUserActiveStatus` (with cascading updates to `Psychologist` model), `adminUpdateUserProfile` (also with cascading updates).
    *   Contains a `psychologistUpdateOwnProfile` method, suggesting some psychologist-specific profile updates are still handled here, complementing the `psychologistController`.
    *   Includes `userUploadDocx` for regular users to upload verification documents.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **12/27/2025, 1:17:35 PM:** Initial implementation of report routes.
*   **12/27/2025, 1:27:34 PM:** Initial implementation of psychologist controller methods (direct functions).
*   **12/27/2025, 1:30:09 PM:** Major refactoring in `psychologistRoutes.js` to use a dedicated controller, introducing a comprehensive set of routes for public, user, psychologist, and admin roles.
*   **12/27/2025, 1:56:43 PM:** Refactoring `psychologistController.js` to a class-based structure.
*   **12/27/2025, 2:17:05 PM:** Introduction of `multer` for file uploads (profile images, documents) into `psychologistRoutes.js`. This is a significant functional addition.
*   **12/27/2025, 4:12:07 PM:** Multer `uploadFiles` middleware applied to admin `create` and `update` psychologist routes in `psychologistRoutes.js`.
*   **12/27/2025, 5:25:54 PM:** Core `app.js` configuration, including security, logging, static file serving, and route integration.
*   **12/27/2025, 5:48:07 PM:** `appointmentRoutes` removed from main API router in `index.js`.
*   **12/27/2025, 9:07:13 PM:** Comprehensive authentication logic in `authController.js`, including parent consent and admin invites.
*   **12/28/2025, 12:34:30 PM:** Detailed authentication service (`authService.js`) covering user registration, login, OTP handling, and age-based consent.
*   **12/28/2025, 1:09:57 PM:** Major refactoring in `userRoutes.js` towards a cleaner, more modular structure for user-related routes, including a new `multer` setup.
*   **12/28/2025, 1:22:11 PM - 1:24:31 PM:** `userRoutes.js` experiences a temporary reversion to include previous commented-out code and then a slight adjustment to `multer` configuration, indicating active development and potential changes in how file uploads are managed for user profiles.
*   **12/28/2025, 4:00:40 PM:** Detailed admin and user profile management logic in `userController.js`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **MVC Architecture:** Strong adherence to the Model-View-Controller pattern, with distinct files for routes and controllers. The `psychologistRoutes.js` and `psychologistController.js` pair clearly demonstrate this, with routes delegating to controller methods.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** The `authenticate` and `authorize` middlewares are consistently applied across almost all routes that require user or role-based access control (e.g., "user", "psychologist", "admin", "superadmin"). This indicates a robust security model.
*   **Error Handling and Response Standardization:** `successResponse` and `errorResponse` utilities (likely from `utils/response.js`) are heavily used across controllers, ensuring consistent API responses. Error logging via `logger.error` (from `utils/logger.js`) is also prevalent.
*   **File Uploads (`multer`):** A recurring need for file uploads (profile images, Aadhar documents, other verification documents) is handled using `multer`. The setup involves defining storage, filename generation, and file filtering, with dedicated directories for different file types. This pattern is evident in `psychologistRoutes.js` and `userRoutes.js`.
*   **Pagination and Filtering:** `getAll`, `adminListUsers`, `getReviews` methods consistently implement pagination (`page`, `limit`) and various filtering options (`specialization`, `search`, `role`, `isActive`), suggesting a common approach for data retrieval.
*   **Age-Based Logic:** The authentication service and controller specifically check `age` for users during registration and login, with special handling for users under 18 requiring `parentConsent`. This highlights a key business requirement.
*   **Refactoring and Evolution:** The log shows an iterative development process, particularly in `psychologistRoutes.js` and `userRoutes.js`, where initial direct route implementations evolve into calls to controller methods, and then further integrate complex middleware like `multer`. This indicates a codebase that is actively being improved and structured.
*   **Commented-Out Code:** Several log entries, particularly for `userRoutes.js` and `psychologistRoutes.js` (earlier versions), contain large blocks of commented-out code. This suggests previous implementations or experimental code that was temporarily disabled rather than fully removed, possibly for future reference or partial rollback.
