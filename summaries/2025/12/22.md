# Activity Summary for 12/22/2025

## 1:34:23 PM
The changes primarily involve the configuration of GitHub Actions workflows for a web project, specifically addressing pull requests for both production and staging environments.

**File-specific updates and timestamps:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\.github\workflows\test-production-pull-request.yml`**
    *   **12/22/2025, 1:21:59 PM:** This file was initially created. It defines a workflow named "Test Production PR" that triggers on pull requests to the "ultimate" branch. The workflow sets up Node.js version 20, runs `npm ci` to install dependencies, and then `npm run build`. Notably, the step name for setting up Node.js was initially "Use Node.js v18" despite configuring `node-version: 20`.
    *   **12/22/2025, 1:22:40 PM:** This file was updated. The only change was to correct the name of the Node.js setup step from "Use Node.js v18" to "Use Node.js v20", aligning it with the actual `node-version: 20` being used.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\.github\workflows\test-staging-pull-request.yml`**
    *   **12/22/2025, 1:22:10 PM:** This file was initially created. It defines a workflow named "Test Staging PR" that triggers on pull requests to the "ultimate-staging" branch. The workflow mirrors the production one: sets up Node.js version 20, runs `npm ci`, and `npm run build`. Similar to the production workflow's initial state, the step name for Node.js setup was "Use Node.js v18" while `node-version: 20` was configured.
    *   **12/22/2025, 1:22:32 PM:** This file was updated. The change corrected the name of the Node.js setup step from "Use Node.js v18" to "Use Node.js v20", making it consistent with the `node-version: 20` setting.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Consistent Workflow Structure:** Both `test-production-pull-request.yml` and `test-staging-pull-request.yml` share an identical structure and sequence of steps: checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies (`npm ci`), and creating a build (`npm run build`).
*   **Targeted Branches:** Workflows are environment-specific, with "production" targeting the "ultimate" branch and "staging" targeting the "ultimate-staging" branch.
*   **Node.js Version Standardization:** All workflows consistently use Node.js version 20.
*   **Correction of Step Name:** A key pattern is the correction of the Node.js setup step's displayed name from "Use Node.js v18" to "Use Node.js v20" across both production and staging workflow files. This indicates an effort to improve clarity and accuracy in the workflow logs.
*   **Rapid Succession of Changes:** All changes occurred on the same date (12/22/2025) and within a very short timeframe (less than a minute), suggesting a concentrated effort to set up and refine CI/CD configurations for a project.
