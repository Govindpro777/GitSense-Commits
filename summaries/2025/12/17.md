# Activity Summary for 12/17/2025

## 9:27:00 AM
The log details a single significant change to the `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\MikeLegal\MikeLegal-Web\components\Home\Footer.tsx` file on **12/16/2025, 2:06:23 PM**.

This file defines the `Footer` functional component, which is a key navigational and informational element of the application.

**Key updates and characteristics of `Footer.tsx`:**

*   **Imports and Dependencies:** The component imports a range of dependencies, including CSS modules (`footer.module.css`), React (`FC`), Next.js components (`Image`, `Link`), social media icons (`LinkedInIcon`, `twitter.svg`, `facebook.svg`), contact icons (`PhoneIcon`, `EamilIcon`), a dedicated `EmailForm` component, Ant Design's `FloatButton`, and a `NotificationIcon`.
*   **Notification Feature (Commented Out):** There's logic for a `notificationButton` which, when clicked, would set `notification_modal_open` in `localStorage` to 'true' and dispatch a custom event `notificationModalStateChange`. This `FloatButton` is rendered with a custom icon, but its invocation within the `footer` element is commented out, suggesting it's either a work-in-progress or a temporarily disabled feature.
*   **Structured Content:** The footer is divided into several logical sections:
    *   **Company Info (`company_info`):** Provides contact details (phone, email) and links to social media profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook).
    *   **Solution Categories:** Offers dedicated sections with links to various IP Solutions (`IPSolutions`, `MikeTM Watch`, `MikeTM Search`, `MikeTM Manager`) and Contract Solutions (`ContractSolutions`, `Mike DocReview`, `Mike DocCompare`, `Litigation Solution`).
    *   **Resources:** Links to external blog, case studies, media mentions, and videos.
    *   **Company Information:** Includes links to "About Us", "Terms of Use", and "Privacy Policy".
*   **Newsletter Subscription:** A dedicated `newsletter_section` encourages users to subscribe and integrates an `EmailForm` component for this purpose.
*   **Copyright and Branding:** The `footer_bottom` section displays the "MikeLegal" logo link and a dynamic copyright notice using `new Date().getFullYear()`.
*   **Client-Side Functionality:** The component utilizes the `'use client'` directive, indicative of client-side interactivity.
*   **Navigation Patterns:** Extensive use of `Link` components from Next.js, with `target="_blank"` for external links and `target="_top"` for internal navigation, ensuring consistent link behavior.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Design:** The footer is built with distinct sections and integrates other components like `EmailForm`, demonstrating a modular approach to UI development.
*   **Iconography:** Consistent use of SVG icons (both custom components and static SVGs) for visual elements like social media, phone, email, and notifications.
*   **External vs. Internal Links:** Clear differentiation in link handling using `target` attributes.
*   **Dynamic Content:** The copyright year is dynamically generated, ensuring it's always current.
