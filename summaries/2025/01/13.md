The provided log only contains information for a `.env` file, which is excluded from summarization due to its potential for containing sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.  Therefore, no summary of code changes can be provided.


## 3:52:33 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `index.html` and `tailwind.config.js`.

`index.html` underwent several changes.  Initially (2:57:21 PM), it was a standard HTML setup with a title "⚡️ Bolt.new + Vite + React".  Later (3:06:44 PM), the title was removed. Finally (3:08:21 PM), the title was set to "WebTree Global Pvt. Ltd.".  No other structural changes to the HTML were observed.

`tailwind.config.js` was modified twice at approximately the same time (3:03:07 PM and 3:03:17 PM). Both changes show the same, minimal configuration,  with commented-out code suggesting that a more extensive Tailwind CSS configuration was previously used, but then significantly simplified. The commented-out section contains detailed theme customization including colors, borderRadius, and animations.  The final, active configuration includes only basic settings for content and plugins.
