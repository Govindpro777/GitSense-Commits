# Activity Summary for 1/31/2025

## 11:33:38 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `PurchaseForm.jsx` and `PlansSection.jsx`.

`PurchaseForm.jsx` (1/31/2025, 10:34:55 AM): This component,  a user registration form, was created. It includes fields for first name, last name, phone number (with country code selection), email, password, password confirmation, QR code payment display area, and payment proof upload (PDF).  The styling is dark-themed with a blue accent color.  The country codes are hardcoded into the component.


`PlansSection.jsx` underwent several revisions between 10:41:28 AM and 10:45:17 AM. The initial versions (10:41:28 AM, 10:43:26 AM, 10:43:43 AM and 10:44:10 AM) were commented out showing different iterations of the component structure, progressively simplifying the layout.  The component displays trading plans.  Initially, it featured a complex, visually appealing layout with gradient backgrounds and arrows indicating plan positions. This later evolved into a simpler, responsive design removing unnecessary visual elements.  The final version (10:45:17 AM) presents the plans in a card layout using flexbox for responsive design and simplified styling. The plans data (title, details, background color) are hardcoded in the component. The changes in `PlansSection.jsx` reflect a refactoring effort to simplify the component's structure and improve its responsiveness.  The `position` property was removed from the `PlanCard` component, indicating a change in layout strategy.
