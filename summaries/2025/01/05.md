# Activity Summary for 1/5/2025

## 12:20:09 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\Booking Table\project\server\index.js` at 1/5/2025, 12:04:18 AM.  This change involves setting up a Node.js server using Express.js, connecting to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, and incorporating CORS middleware.  The server uses environment variables (`PORT` and `MONGODB_URL`) for configuration and includes a route `/api/bookings` likely handled by a separate `bookingRoutes` module.  The code gracefully handles MongoDB connection errors by exiting the process if a connection fails.  The key elements are environment variable loading, database connection, middleware usage (CORS and JSON body parsing), route definition, and error handling.
