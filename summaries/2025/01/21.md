# Activity Summary for 1/21/2025

## 12:53:43 AM
The log shows development of a React application.  Initially, a simple `App.jsx` component was created, displaying only "hello".  Between 11:54 PM and 11:58 PM on January 20th, 2025,  `App.jsx` underwent several revisions.  The `useState` hook was initially included then removed, and a `home` component was added and integrated. The `home` component's import path was corrected (from `'./components/home'` to `'./components/Home'`). There was also a brief period of incomplete code.

On January 20th, a `home.jsx` component was created. The name of the default export in `home.jsx` was corrected from `home` to `Home`.

Around 11:57 PM on January 20th, changes in `main.jsx` show the `home` component being added and subsequently removed from the application's root rendering.

On January 21st, 2025, at 12:00 AM, the order of `<h1>hello</h1>` and `<Home/>` was switched within `App.jsx`. A `NavBar` component was created and added to `App.jsx` at 12:00:34 AM.  Finally, the `home.jsx` component's styling was adjusted, changing from `h-1200px w-800px` to `h-[1200px] w-[800px]` between 12:01 AM and 12:02 AM.  This suggests a move towards using tailwindcss-like syntax.
