# Activity Summary for 1/12/2025

## 8:17:33 PM
The log shows updates to the frontend components of a MERN stack authentication application.

On January 12th, 2025, at 7:28:23 PM, `Login.tsx` was updated.  This component handles user login, using axios to make a POST request to a backend API (`https://mern-auth-backend-plum.vercel.app/api/auth/login`) for authentication.  Upon successful login, it stores the token and user data in localStorage and redirects to the home page (`/`). Error handling is implemented using `react-hot-toast` for displaying success and error messages. The component uses `lucide-react` for icons.

Later, at 7:38:09 PM, `Register.tsx` was updated. This component is similar to `Login.tsx`, handling user registration via a POST request to `https://mern-auth-backend-plum.vercel.app/api/auth/register`.  It shares the same structure and libraries (`axios`, `react-hot-toast`, `lucide-react`, `react-router-dom`) and a similar pattern of handling form data, API requests, and local storage.  The key difference is that it includes a field for the user's name.  Both components use consistent styling.

The recurring elements across both files are the use of `axios` for API calls, `react-hot-toast` for feedback, and similar form handling logic.  Both components store the token and user data in local storage after successful authentication.  The consistent styling suggests a design system is in place.
