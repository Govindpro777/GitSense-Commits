# Activity Summary for 1/25/2025

## 10:55:43 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `SubmitForm.jsx` between 10:15:08 AM and 10:16:21 AM on January 25th, 2025.  The changes all center around the styling and responsiveness of a React form component.

The first three revisions (10:15:08 AM, 10:15:52 AM, 10:16:03 AM) modified the width of the form's container (`div`).  Initially, it was set to `w-1/2`, then changed to `w-full`, and finally remained as `w-full`. This suggests an attempt to adjust the form's width for different screen sizes. The final revision (10:16:21 AM) further refined the responsiveness by adding `lg:w-full` to the container's class, likely making the form occupy full width on larger screens.  The rest of the component's code (the form's structure, input fields, and submit button) remained consistent throughout all revisions.
