## 2:01:33 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\Recipi Book\src\pages\RecipeDetails.jsx` on January 24, 2025, at 1:41:14 AM.  This commit updates the `RecipeDetails` component.  The component now fetches recipe details using `react-query` and displays them with error handling and loading indicators.  It uses `lucide-react` icons for visual elements and presents recipe information (image, title, cooking time, servings, ingredients, and instructions) in a structured and visually appealing layout. The instructions are rendered using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for potentially rich text formatting.  The component also includes a back button using `react-router-dom` to navigate back to a recipe list (presumably).
