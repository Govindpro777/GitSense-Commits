## 2:01:33 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\Recipi Book\src\pages\RecipeDetails.jsx` on January 24, 2025, at 1:41:14 AM.  This commit updates the `RecipeDetails` component.  The component now fetches recipe details using `react-query` and displays them with error handling and loading indicators.  It uses `lucide-react` icons for visual elements and presents recipe information (image, title, cooking time, servings, ingredients, and instructions) in a structured and visually appealing layout. The instructions are rendered using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for potentially rich text formatting.  The component also includes a back button using `react-router-dom` to navigate back to a recipe list (presumably).

The log shows a single code update to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\Recipi Book\src\api.js` on January 24th, 2025, at 3:39:08 PM.  This file contains JavaScript functions for interacting with a recipe API (likely Spoonacular, given the base URL).  The key updates are the implementation of three asynchronous functions: `getRandomRecipes`, `getRecipeById`, and `searchRecipes`.  Each function uses the `fetch` API to make requests to the Spoonacular API, incorporating an API key (`ee616623b28b454cb0b390266ede3061`) for authentication. Error handling is included in each function to check for failed requests.  The functions retrieve random recipes, recipe details by ID, and search results based on a query, respectively.  A consistent pattern is the use of the API key and a similar structure for error handling and data retrieval across all three functions.
