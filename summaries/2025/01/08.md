# Activity Summary for 1/8/2025

## 1:19:48 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `index.html` and one to `about.html` between 12:29 AM and 1:10 AM on January 8th, 2025.  The `index.html` file remained largely unchanged throughout the edits; the modifications were minor and appear to be related to styling or formatting and do not affect core functionality.  No recurring patterns in the content changes are evident within `index.html`.

The `about.html` file, however, underwent significant changes.  Initially, it included standard HTML structure similar to `index.html` along with sign-in and sign-up links.  Subsequent edits introduced a logout button and Javascript code to manage the display of login, signup, and logout elements based on whether a token exists in local storage.  This suggests the implementation of user authentication. The commented-out sections of javascript further support this, showing the iterative development of the login/logout functionality. The final version dynamically controls the visibility of login, signup, and logout buttons according to the presence of a token.  This implies a user authentication system is being integrated.  The timestamps of significant changes are 1:01:07 AM, 1:01:36 AM, 1:05:27 AM, 1:05:39 AM, 1:07:37 AM, 1:07:49 AM, and 1:10:46 AM, all concentrated within a short period.  The changes in `about.html` show a clear progression towards a functional authentication feature using local storage for token management.


## 2:19:35 AM
The log shows two revisions of the `about.html` file on January 8th, 2025.  The first revision (2:17:41 AM) contains a complete HTML file for an "Overhaul Locus" website's about page.  This page includes sections for social media links, navigation, an about us section with an image, a newsletter signup, and a footer with contact information and quick links.  Crucially, it also includes commented-out sign-in and sign-up links and a commented-out JavaScript section for handling user login status. The code includes links to various CSS and JavaScript files.


The second revision (2:18:23 AM), made only a minute later, appears to be identical to the first, except for a small but important change within the Javascript section: The commented-out JavaScript snippet  is replaced with a new, concise JavaScript function (`checkLoginStatus`)  that uses `localStorage` to manage the visibility of "Sign In," "Sign Up," and "Log Out" buttons based on whether a token exists in local storage.  This implies the implementation of a basic user authentication system.  The rest of the HTML structure remains unchanged.  The quick succession of these changes suggests a rapid iterative development process.
