# Activity Summary for 1/4/2025

## 3:45:58 PM
The main change on January 4th, 2025, at 3:25:23 PM, involved the `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\Booking Table\project\app\booking\page.tsx` file.  This file, a React component for a booking page, received updates primarily focused on the handling of booking data and the API call for booking confirmation.

Specifically:

* **Type Definition:**  A `BookingDetails` interface was added to explicitly define the structure of booking information, importantly using the `Date` type for the `date` property instead of a string. This improves type safety.

* **API Endpoint Change:** The API endpoint used for submitting booking requests was changed from `https://table-booking-assignment.onrender.com/api/bookings` to `http://localhost:3001/api/bookings`, suggesting a shift from a production environment to a local development environment.

* **Date Handling:** The code was modified to ensure that the `date` property is consistently handled as a `Date` object throughout the component, both when sending data to the API and when displaying booking summaries.  Previously, the date was converted to an ISO string; now it remains a Date object.

* **No functional changes to UI**: The User Interface of the booking page did not change.


The overall change represents a likely transition from a deployed version to local development.  The addition of the `BookingDetails` interface and the consistent use of the `Date` type indicate an improvement in code clarity and maintainability.

The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\Booking Table\project\server\index.js` at 1/4/2025, 4:28:14 PM.  This change represents a basic Node.js server setup.  Key elements include: loading environment variables using `dotenv`, setting up Express.js, enabling CORS and JSON body parsing middleware, connecting to a MongoDB database using a URL from environment variables (`MONGODB_URL`), defining routes for booking management (`/api/bookings` which presumably points to a `bookingRoutes` module), and finally starting the server on the port specified in the environment variable (`PORT`).  The code includes error handling for the MongoDB connection, gracefully exiting if it fails.  The overall pattern is a standard structure for a RESTful API backend.
