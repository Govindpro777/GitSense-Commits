# Activity Summary for 1/7/2025

## 10:39:21 PM
The log shows development activity on a web application with a backend server.

**Server-Side (server.js, User.js, auth.js, .env):**

* **1/7/2025, 9:50:20 PM:** The `server.js` file was initialized, setting up an Express.js server with  Mongoose for MongoDB connection, CORS for handling cross-origin requests, and dotenv for environment variables.  It also includes the `authRoutes`.

* **1/7/2025, 9:50:46 PM:** A `User` model was created in `User.js`, defining the schema for users with fields like `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, and `password`.  Timestamps are enabled.

* **1/7/2025, 9:51:26 PM:** The `auth.js` file was created, containing routes for user registration, login, and token validation using bcrypt for password hashing and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

* **1/7/2025, 10:02:46 PM & 10:03:36 PM:** The `.env` file was updated to add a MongoDB connection string.  The initial version was empty. The final version contains the MongoDB connection string.


* **1/7/2025, 10:13:07 PM & 10:13:49 PM:**  `auth.js` underwent a significant revision. The initial version had all the authentication routes commented out. The second version un-commented the routes, added error handling functions and improved error responses by using a helper function and logging errors to the console.  A fallback secret was added for `JWT_SECRET` as well.

* **1/7/2025, 10:19:05 PM:**  `server.js` was slightly modified; the `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` options were removed from the mongoose connection string.

**Client-Side (index.html):**

* **1/7/2025, 9:57:52 PM, 9:59:09 PM, 10:00:02 PM, 10:24:41 PM:** The `index.html` file was repeatedly updated, possibly reflecting iterative changes to the front-end design and layout.  The content suggests this is a fairly complex webpage, with sections for navigation, a slider, service descriptions, team introductions, and social media links. There were no significant functional changes, only possibly small styling or layout adjustments during these multiple commits.  The repetitive nature of the commits for this file indicates likely iterative development.


**Overall Pattern:** The log demonstrates a common development workflow:  starting with the server setup, defining data models, implementing authentication, and iteratively refining the front-end. The multiple commits to `index.html` without significant changes suggest a focus on visual presentation in the UI, possibly using iterative refinements. The changes to `auth.js` showcase a transition from a basic implementation to one with more robust error handling and a default secret key for better security and development practice.
