# Activity Summary for 1/27/2025

## 3:55:08 PM
The log shows development on a React frontend for a binary funding account application.  Significant changes occurred around 10:01 AM and 3:00 PM.

**`LoginForm.jsx`**: This component underwent several revisions. Initially (9:42 AM and 9:44 AM), it was a modal login form.  Type annotations were removed in a later revision (9:44 AM).  Finally, around 3:00 PM, it was refactored into a full-page login form using `react-router-dom`'s `useNavigate` hook for redirection after successful login.  The handleSubmit function was also modified at 3:02 PM and 3:02 PM to remove the axios post function. The handleSubmit function is then added again at 3:15PM and 3:15PM.


**`SignupForm.jsx`**: Similar to `LoginForm.jsx`, this component initially (9:45 AM) was a modal signup form. Around 10:01 AM, it was also converted to a full-page component using `react-router-dom`, and improvements were made to its styling and structure.   A minor change at 2:59 PM removed the type annotation from event handler. Further changes were made at 2:59 PM and 3:00 PM to refactor into a full-page component.


**`Navbar.jsx`**: This component started as a simple navbar displaying user information (9:49 AM).  It was then modified to include a menu button for smaller screens and login/signup buttons (9:52 AM). Multiple revisions followed (9:52 AM to 9:57 AM), primarily altering the initial visibility state of the login and signup modals.  The login/signup buttons eventually became conditionally rendered based on screen size (9:52 AM onwards) and all previous code versions were commented out. Finally, the component reverted to a simple navbar at 12:26 PM.


**`Trade.jsx`**: This component renders a TradingView chart and trading controls.  The main changes involved styling improvements and adjusting the placement and styling of the title (12:28 PM to 12:30 PM).


**`App.jsx`**: This component manages the routing and rendering of different application sections. Initially (3:02 PM), only the login form was rendered.  Then it was updated at 3:04 PM to implement routing using `react-router-dom` to switch between login, signup and dashboard. A major restructuring at 3:16 PM included conditional rendering of different components depending on the `activeComponent` state, managed through a sidebar, and finally returning to the initial state at 3:05 PM and again at 3:11 PM.


**`main.jsx`**: This file sets up the React application using `react-dom/client` and `react-router-dom`.  The key change was adding the BrowserRouter component at 3:14 PM to enable client side routing.


**`Profile.jsx`**: This component handles user profile information and password changes.  The component was built at 3:07 PM, refactored to change input type of country to select at 3:08 PM, then name of dateOfBirth was changed to contactNo at 3:09 PM and finally at 3:10 PM the styling of the save button was adjusted.


**`Sidebar.jsx`**: This component was developed to allow navigation between sections of the application, it includes a menu toggle and links to the various sections.  Multiple revisions around 3:22 PM to 3:54 PM show iterative development of the sidebar.  At 3:48 PM, login/logout functionality was added.  The `handleAuthToggle` function and login state were initially included (3:22-3:48 PM) but later removed (3:48 PM). A final version at 3:54 PM included "Login" and "Signup" options in the sidebar.


A recurring pattern is the iterative development and refactoring of components, particularly `LoginForm.jsx`, `SignupForm.jsx`, and `Navbar.jsx`. The initial modal forms were replaced with full-page versions utilizing the `react-router-dom` library for navigation.  The changes demonstrate a progressive refinement of the UI and integration of routing capabilities.
