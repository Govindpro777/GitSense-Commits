# Activity Summary for 1/11/2025

## 11:49:15 AM
The `.env` file located at `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\New folder\project-bolt-sb1-z8xswzhy (1)\project\server\.env` was updated on January 11th, 2025 at 3:28:06 AM.  This update sets environment variables for a MongoDB connection (`MONGODB_URI`), a JWT secret (`JWT_SECRET`), and the server port (`PORT`).  The MongoDB connection string reveals a connection to a cluster named `CodingJunior`. The JWT secret is placeholder text indicating a need for a secure key replacement. The port is set to 5000.  The changes represent initial configuration of the server environment.


## 4:30:26 PM
The log shows development of a Node.js server for a mood journal application.  The primary files modified are `package.json` and `index.js`, both located within the `project\server` directory.

The initial `package.json` entry (4:21:39 PM) defines the project's metadata, dependencies (including `express`, `mongoose`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `bcryptjs`), and devDependencies (including `nodemon`). Notably, it initially omits `"type": "module"`.

The `index.js` file (4:21:50 PM) sets up an Express.js server, connecting to a MongoDB database (`connectDB`), implementing middleware (CORS and JSON parsing), and defining routes for authentication (`/api/auth`), journal entries (`/api/entries`), and quotes (`/api/quotes`).

A subsequent update to `package.json` (4:22:08 PM) adds `"type": "module"`, indicating a shift to ES modules.  This suggests a potential refactoring or update to the project's configuration to leverage modern JavaScript module imports.  All other aspects of the `package.json` file remain the same in the second entry. The changes were made within a short time frame (approximately 20 minutes).


## 4:31:19 PM
The log shows a single code update to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\New folder (5)\project-bolt-sb1-c1gthjcv\project\server\routes\entries.js` at 1/11/2025, 3:35:49 PM.  This file defines Express.js routes for managing journal entries.  The code implements four RESTful API endpoints: GET (retrieve all entries for a user), POST (create a new entry), PUT (update an entry), and DELETE (delete an entry).  All routes are protected using authentication middleware (`auth`). Each endpoint includes error handling using try...catch blocks.  A consistent pattern is the use of `JournalEntry` model for database interaction and the inclusion of `userId` to ensure data integrity and user authorization.
