# Activity Summary for 1/2/2025

## 5:53:31 PM
The log shows the development of a table booking application.  The earliest changes (5:03 PM and 5:24 PM) set up the backend server, defining environment variables in `.env` (PORT and MONGODB_URL) and using Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction), and CORS in `index.js`.  The MongoDB connection details point to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

The bulk of the changes (5:41 PM - 5:52 PM) focus on the frontend component (`booking/page.tsx`), building a React form for booking tables.  This involves a calendar for date selection, input fields for user details (name, email, phone, guests), and time slots. The form submits booking data to an API endpoint (`https://table-booking-assignment.onrender.com/api/bookings`). The application includes visual feedback using toast notifications for successful and failed bookings, and shows a confirmation dialog (`BookingConfirmationDialog`) upon successful submission.  There were several minor revisions to the `booking/page.tsx` file between 5:41 PM and 5:52 PM, primarily concerning simplification of code,  and refinement of error handling and toast messages for better user experience. The final commit at 5:52 PM includes improved error messages and uses the `status` and `duration` properties for toast notifications. The earlier versions of `booking/page.tsx` (5:41 PM, 5:44 PM, 5:45 PM, 5:49 PM, 5:50 PM) show iterative improvements to the booking form and the handling of booking success and failure.  One version (5:49 PM) briefly contained a duplicated line of code setting `confirmedBooking`, which was removed in the subsequent revision. The very last revision at 5:52 PM significantly improved the structure and clarity of the code in `booking/page.tsx`.
