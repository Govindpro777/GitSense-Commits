# Activity Summary for 1/23/2025

The log shows a single entry for `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\Recipi Book\src\api.js` on January 23, 2025 at 10:27:50 PM.  This file contains JavaScript code defining three asynchronous functions for interacting with a recipe API (likely Spoonacular, given the URL).  The functions `getRandomRecipes`, `getRecipeById`, and `searchRecipes` fetch recipe data using a Spoonacular API key (`ee616623b28b454cb0b390266ede3061`).  Each function handles potential errors by throwing an exception if the API request fails. The `getRandomRecipes` and `searchRecipes` functions retrieve 12 recipes, while `getRecipeById` fetches details for a single recipe.  The code uses `fetch` for API calls and `response.json()` for parsing the JSON responses.  The key pattern is consistent use of the API key and error handling.
