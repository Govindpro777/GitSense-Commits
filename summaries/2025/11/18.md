# Activity Summary for 11/18/2025

## 11:43:13 AM
The provided log details changes across two main files: `src\constants.js` and `src\components\Dashboard\Dashboard.jsx`, and `src\components\Brand\Overview\Overview.jsx` and `src\components\Brand\MediaScore\MediaScore.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 10:56:14 AM and 11/18/2025, 10:57:00 AM, 11/18/2025, 11:24:28 AM**
  - No functional code changes were introduced across these timestamps. The content of the file remained identical in all three entries. This file primarily defines various API endpoints and constant values for the frontend application. These constants are derived from environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_URL_V1`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATTACHMENT_URL`) and hardcoded values like `STATICCOUNT = 1000`. It includes a wide range of API calls categorized by functionality such as authentication, user preferences, campaign management, reporting, search, podcast, social media (Instagram, Twitter), GEO statistics, and brand tracking.
  - The `ATTACH_URL` constant was imported in `Overview.jsx` at 11:31:59 AM, indicating its usage in constructing image URLs.

#### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Dashboard\Dashboard.jsx`
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 10:57:49 AM**
  - Initial state for `Dashboard2` component, using `useState` for `trackingId`.
  - Employs `useMetadata` hook for SEO.
  - An `useEffect` hook generates a UUID for `trackingId` on component mount.
  - Another `useEffect` fetches brand-related data (`GET_BRAND_DATA_STATUS`, `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `GET_CLIENT_LOGO`) and stores it in `localStorage`.
  - The `getClientLogo` function stores `res?.data?.logoUrl` in `localStorage` under the key "clientLogo".
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:17:50 AM**
  - **Minor change:** In `getClientLogo`, the `localStorage` key for the client logo was updated from `res?.data?.logoUrl` to `res?.data?.brandLogoPath`. The key "clientLogo" remains the same.
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:18:11 AM**
  - **Significant change:** The `getBrandData` asynchronous function, which fetched `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE` and stored `brandName` in `localStorage`, was commented out. However, its call `getBrandData()` was *not* commented out, leading to a potential error as the function is no longer defined.
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:19:01 AM**
  - **Minor change:** The `localStorage` key for storing client logo path was changed from "clientLogo" to "brandData" within the `getClientLogo` function.
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:20:10 AM**
  - **Significant change:** The `getClientLogo` function was updated to store a more comprehensive `brandData` object in `localStorage`. Instead of just the logo path, it now stores a JSON string containing both `image` (from `brandLogoPath`) and `brandName` (from `res?.data?.brandName`). The key remains "brandData".
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:20:55 AM**
  - **Crucial fix/change:** The commented-out `getBrandData` function was re-enabled, but with a new purpose. It now calls the `GET_CLIENT_LOGO` API (instead of `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`) and stores the combined brand image and name data into `localStorage` under the "brandData" key, effectively duplicating the logic of the `getClientLogo` function. The original `getClientLogo` call was also retained, leading to redundant API calls and `localStorage` updates.

#### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Overview\Overview.jsx`
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:22:09 AM**
  - Initial version of the `Overview` component for brand dashboards.
  - It uses `useState` to manage various data points (brand impact, SOV, mentions, sentiment score), selected period, media types, and graph types.
  - Utilizes `useBrandMediaTypes` and `useLocalStorage` custom hooks.
  - Fetches `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_NO_OF_MENTIONS`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE` from `userService`.
  - Displays skeleton loading states for data while fetching.
  - Includes a conditional render based on `brand-dashboard-status` in `localStorage`, showing a message if the dashboard isn't set up.
  - The brand name in the header is dynamically displayed using `brandData.brandName` from `localStorage`.
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:29:09 AM**
  - **Visual change:** An `<img>` tag was added in the header section to display the brand logo. The `src` attribute for this image directly used `brandData?.image` from `localStorage`.
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:31:59 AM**
  - **API dependency change:** The `ATTACH_URL` constant was imported from `@/constants`.
  - **Image source update:** The `src` attribute for the brand logo `<img>` tag was updated to dynamically construct the image URL using `ATTACH_URL` and `brandData?.image`: ``${ATTACH_URL}BrandLogos/${brandData?.image}``.
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:32:48 AM**
  - **Styling change:** The brand logo `<img>` tag received updated CSS classes for sizing: `w-10 h-10 sm:w-12 sm:h-12`. A `gap-3` class was added to the parent `div` for spacing, and `items-center` for alignment.
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:33:08 AM**
  - **Styling change:** Further adjustment to the brand logo `<img>` tag's width and height classes: `w-8 h-8 sm:w-10 sm:h-10`.
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:41:09 AM**
  - **Styling change:** Final adjustment to the brand logo `<img>` tag's width and height classes: `w-[32px] h-[32px]`.

#### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\MediaScore\MediaScore.jsx`
- **Timestamp: 11/18/2025, 11:42:38 AM**
  - Initial version of the `MediaScore` component.
  - Manages `isLoading`, `brandImpactData`, `competitorData`, and `period` states.
  - Imports `ATTACH_URL` but it is not currently used within the component.
  - Fetches `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE` and `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS` based on the selected period.
  - Displays brand impact score and its change, along with a table showing competitor rankings.
  - Includes skeleton loading for data.
  - Similar to `Overview.jsx`, it has a conditional render for the brand dashboard setup status.
  - It accesses `brandName` directly, which is not defined in the component's scope, suggesting a potential runtime error. `brandData` is available via `useLocalStorage` but `brandName` is not directly extracted.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:
- **11/18/2025, 11:18:11 AM (Dashboard.jsx):** `getBrandData` function commented out but still called.
- **11/18/2025, 11:20:10 AM (Dashboard.jsx):** `getClientLogo` updated to store structured JSON data (`image`, `brandName`) in `localStorage` under "brandData".
- **11/18/2025, 11:20:55 AM (Dashboard.jsx):** Reintroduced/modified `getBrandData` call, now redundantly fetching `GET_CLIENT_LOGO` and storing to "brandData".
- **11/18/2025, 11:29:09 AM (Overview.jsx):** Introduction of brand logo display.
- **11/18/2025, 11:31:59 AM (Overview.jsx):** Brand logo URL construction using `ATTACH_URL` constant.
- **11/18/2025, 11:42:38 AM (MediaScore.jsx):** Initial implementation of a new `MediaScore` component, including competitor ranking display.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
- **Environment Variables for URLs:** Many constants in `constants.js` are derived from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...`, indicating a robust configuration management strategy for different deployment environments.
- **API Endpoint Structure:** Almost all API endpoints are constructed by concatenating `Url_V1` with specific paths, such as `/authenticate/login`, `/userpreference/preferences`, `/GetLists`, etc. This `Url_V1` prefix suggests a versioned API.
- **Consistent Error Handling:** Across `Dashboard.jsx`, `Overview.jsx`, and `MediaScore.jsx`, `try-catch` blocks are used for API calls, with `console.log` for error reporting.
- **`localStorage` Usage:** `localStorage` is extensively used to persist application state, such as brand dashboard status, brand name, and client logo/brand data, to avoid refetching on every page load.
- **Custom Hooks:** The `useMetadata`, `useBrandMediaTypes`, and `useLocalStorage` hooks are consistently applied for common functionalities, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
- **Brand Dashboard Setup Check:** Both `Overview.jsx` and `MediaScore.jsx` include a conditional rendering logic to check for `brand-dashboard-status` in `localStorage` and display a "contact account manager" message if not set up, indicating a feature gate or onboarding requirement.
- **Skeleton Loaders:** `react-loading-skeleton` is used in both `Overview.jsx` and `MediaScore.jsx` to provide a better user experience while data is being fetched.
- **Period-Based Data Fetching:** `Overview.jsx` and `MediaScore.jsx` fetch data based on a selected time period (e.g., "Last 1 month", "Previous 3 months"), demonstrating a common filtering pattern for analytical dashboards.
- **Dashboard Component Structure:** Multiple sub-components like `Header`, `TrendingJornalists`, `BeatWatch`, `Skribe365`, `Favorites` are used in `Dashboard.jsx`, indicating a modular approach to building dashboards. Similarly, `BrandHeader`, `Spokesperson`, `MediaArticleCount`, `AIGeneratedOpinion`, etc., are used in `Overview.jsx`.

**Potential Issue:** In `Dashboard.jsx`, at 11:20:55 AM, the `getBrandData()` call was reactivated but now points to the same API endpoint (`GET_CLIENT_LOGO`) and `localStorage` key as `getClientLogo()`, leading to redundant API calls and `localStorage` writes. The original intent of `getBrandData` (fetching `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE` for `brandName`) was lost/overwritten. Also, in `MediaScore.jsx` at 11:42:38 AM, `brandName` is used directly without being explicitly defined or destructured from `brandData`.
