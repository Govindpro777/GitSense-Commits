# Activity Summary for 11/27/2025

## 10:44:50 AM
In `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`, updated on 11/27/2025 at 9:52:41 AM, a React component named `MediaScore` was developed to display various media performance metrics and data visualizations.

**Key updates and functionalities:**

*   **Data Transformation Functions:** The component includes dedicated functions (`transformMediaImpactData`, `transformMediaMentionCountData`) to process raw data (e.g., `mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`) into a format suitable for charting. These functions extract unique categories (like months or mention types) and create data series, handling cases where data might be missing.
*   **ApexCharts Integration:** The component heavily utilizes `ReactApexChart` (dynamically imported for client-side rendering) to generate several types of charts:
    *   **Article Count Line Chart (`lineChartData`):** Displays article counts over time, grouped by brand, with custom styling for axes, legend, and tooltip.
    *   **Media Impact Line Chart (`impactLineChartData`):** Visualizes brand impact scores across months, including specific styling and a "No data available" message for empty states.
    *   **Media Mention Count Bar Chart (`mentionBarChartData`):** Presents stacked bar charts for different mention types over months, with similar styling conventions for axes, legend, and data handling.
    *   **Quality of Mentions Pie Chart (`qualityPieChartData`):** Shows the distribution of mention types using a donut chart, including data labels and a "No data available" fallback.
*   **Performance Metrics Section:** A conditionally rendered section (`msSelectedComps.includes("Performance Metrics")`) displays key performance indicators such as "Average Share of Voice" and "No of Mentions." Each metric shows its value and a `changePercent`, which is dynamically styled to appear green for positive changes and red for negative changes.
*   **Styling and Layout:** The component uses a responsive layout (`flex justify-between flex-col w-1/2 min-h-[841px]`) and consistent styling for sections, titles, and individual metric cards, primarily using Tailwind CSS classes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Charting:** A dominant pattern is the use of `ReactApexChart` for almost all data visualization needs within the component, showcasing different chart types.
*   **Consistent Chart Styling:** ApexCharts configurations frequently share common options like `toolbar: { show: false }`, specific `colors`, and detailed `xaxis`, `yaxis`, `legend`, and `grid` styling, often using black (`#000`) for labels and borders.
*   **Data Handling for Charts:** A recurring approach is to define `noData` options for charts, ensuring a user-friendly message when data is unavailable.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Sections of the report are conditionally rendered based on selected components (`msSelectedComps`) passed as props.
*   **Metric Display Format:** Performance metrics consistently show a value and a percentage change, with the percentage change dynamically colored based on its sign (positive/negative).
*   **Data Transformation Logic:** Many data processing steps involve iterating through data to extract unique categories (like months) and then mapping relevant counts or scores to these categories to form chart series.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx` was updated on `11/27/2025, 9:52:41 AM`.

This `MediaScore.jsx` file defines a React client component designed to render a detailed "Media Score" section within a brand report. Its primary function is to visualize various media performance metrics using dynamic charts and display key performance indicators.

**Key Updates and Functionality:**

*   **Charting Library**: Integrates `react-apexcharts` via `next/dynamic` for client-side rendering, enabling the creation of diverse chart types.
*   **Performance Metrics Display**:
    *   Includes a "Performance Metrics" section that is conditionally rendered based on the `msSelectedComps` prop.
    *   Displays "Average Share of Voice" and "No of Mentions" with their respective percentage changes (styled in green for positive, red for negative).
*   **Data Visualization Charts**:
    *   **Article Count Line Chart**: Visualizes `mediaArticleCountData`, showing brand-wise article counts over time, with months mapped to short names.
    *   **Media Impact Line Chart**: Displays `mediaImpactGraphData` showing media impact scores for different brands over months.
    *   **Media Mention Count Bar Chart**: A stacked bar chart presenting `mediaMentionCountData`, categorized by mention type (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and month.
    *   **Quality of Mentions Pie/Donut Chart**: Renders `qualityOfMentions` data as a donut chart, illustrating the distribution of mention types (e.g., positive, negative).
*   **Data Transformation**: Contains dedicated helper functions (`transformMediaImpactData`, `transformMediaMentionCountData`) to preprocess raw data into series and categories suitable for `react-apexcharts`.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Data Handling**: Many sections and data points are conditionally rendered or displayed with fallback values (`--`) if data is `undefined` or `null`, ensuring robustness.
*   **Styling**: Employs utility classes for layout (`flex`, `grid`, `w-1/2`, `p-6`) and visual presentation (`bg-white`, `rounded-lg`, `border-[#00000033]`), suggesting the use of a framework like Tailwind CSS.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Chart Configuration**: A recurring pattern is the extensive configuration of `react-apexcharts` options, including common settings for `chart` type, `colors`, `stroke`, `markers`, `xaxis`, `yaxis`, `legend` (typically `bottom`, `horizontalAlign: 'center'`, square markers), `grid` (`strokeDashArray: 4`), and `noData` message styling.
*   **Dynamic Data Processing**: The use of `Array.from(new Set(...))` to extract unique categories (like months or mention types) and then mapping data to create chart series is a common pattern for preparing data.
*   **Metric Styling**: Percentage changes in performance metrics consistently use conditional styling (green for `+`, red for `-`) to indicate trends.
*   **Font and Color Scheme**: Chart labels, axis texts, and general text often use `#000` or `#000000` for color, with `Inter, sans-serif` as the specified font family for some charts.

In `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`, updated on 11/27/2025 at 9:52:41 AM, a React client component named `MediaScore` is defined. This component is responsible for rendering various media-related performance and impact metrics using `react-apexcharts`.

Key updates and features include:

*   **Dynamic Chart Loading**: `react-apexcharts` is dynamically imported to disable server-side rendering, ensuring client-side only rendering for charts.
*   **Data Transformation Logic**: Several helper functions are implemented to preprocess raw data received via props into a format suitable for ApexCharts:
    *   `transformMediaImpactData`: Transforms `mediaImpactGraphData` into series and categories for a line chart, extracting monthly scores for each brand.
    *   Logic for `lineChartData`: Processes `mediaArticleCountData` to group article counts by brand and month, converting month strings to short month names for categories.
    *   `transformMediaMentionCountData`: Transforms `mediaMentionCountData` into series and categories for a bar chart, grouping mentions by type and month.
*   **ApexChart Configurations**:
    *   **Article Count Line Chart (`lineChartData`)**: Displays monthly article counts, with `line` type, smooth curves, custom colors (`#6366F1`, `#06B6D4`, `#FB923C`, `#10B981`), customized axis labels, legend (bottom, center), and grid. Tooltips are enabled for shared, intersected data points.
    *   **Media Impact Line Chart (`impactLineChartData`)**: Renders media impact scores over months as a `line` chart with smooth curves, specific colors, customized axis, legend, and grid. It includes a "No data available" message.
    *   **Media Mention Bar Chart (`mentionBarChartData`)**: Presents media mention counts by type and month as a `stacked` `bar` chart with custom colors, customized axis, legend, and grid. It also includes a "No data available" message.
    *   **Quality of Mentions Pie Chart (`qualityPieChartData`)**: Visualizes the `qualityOfMentions` data as a `pie` chart with a `donut` configuration, custom colors, labels, and data labels. It includes a "No data available" message.
*   **Component Props**: The component expects extensive data via props such as `mediaPerformanceSovData`, `mediaPerformanceNoOfMentionsData`, `mediaArticleCountData`, `mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`, `qualityOfMentions`, and others, along with period selections (`msPerformanceMetricPeriod`, `msImpactScorePeriod`) and selected components (`msSelectedComps`).
*   **UI Structure**: The component renders a main section with a title "Media Score".
*   **Conditional Rendering**: A "Performance Metrics" section, including "Average Share of Voice" and "No of Mentions" cards, is conditionally displayed based on whether "Performance Metrics" is included in `msSelectedComps`. Each card shows a value and a percentage change, colored green for positive change and red for negative.
*   **Styling Patterns**: Uses Tailwind CSS classes for layout (`flex`, `grid`), spacing (`p-6`, `mb-4`, `gap-4`), colors (`bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `text-[#000000]`), and responsive design (`sm:flex-row`). Chart configurations consistently apply specific font families (`Inter, sans-serif`), axis styling, and legend placement.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**

This React client-side component, `MediaScore`, is designed to display a comprehensive media score report, likely for brand performance analysis. It dynamically loads `react-apexcharts` for various data visualizations and integrates with a `react-loading-skeleton` for potential loading states (though the skeleton itself isn't fully used in the provided snippet).

Key updates and features include:

*   **Data Visualization:** The component is heavily focused on presenting data through charts. It processes multiple data props (e.g., `mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaArticleCountData`, `mediaMentionCountData`, `qualityOfMentions`) to generate data series and categories for four distinct chart types:
    *   **Impact Score Line Chart:** Visualizes media impact over time for different brands, dynamically transforming `mediaImpactGraphData`.
    *   **Article Count Line Chart:** Displays article counts per brand over selected months, processing `mediaArticleCountData`.
    *   **Mention Count Bar Chart:** A stacked bar chart showing the count of different mention types across months, derived from `mediaMentionCountData`.
    *   **Quality of Mentions Pie Chart:** A donut chart illustrating the distribution of various mention types based on `qualityOfMentions`.
*   **ApexCharts Configuration:** Each chart is meticulously configured using ApexCharts, including:
    *   Custom color palettes (e.g., `["#6366F1", "#06B6D4", "#FB923C", "#10B981"]`).
    *   `smooth` curves for line charts and `stacked` bars for bar charts.
    *   Detailed `xaxis`, `yaxis`, `legend`, `grid`, and `tooltip` options, with custom label styling (e.g., `fontSize`, `colors`) and formatting (e.g., `toLocaleString` for tooltip values).
    *   `noData` messages for charts to handle empty datasets gracefully.
    *   Toolbar display is consistently set to `show: false`.
*   **Performance Metrics Section:**
    *   Conditionally rendered based on `msSelectedComps` including "Performance Metrics".
    *   Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) like "Average Share of Voice" and "No of Mentions" in cards.
    *   Each card shows the current metric value and a `changePercent`, which is dynamically styled (green for positive change, red for negative change).
    *   Values are formatted for readability (e.g., `toLocaleString("en-US")` for mention counts).
*   **Data Transformation Logic:** Helper functions like `transformMediaImpactData` and `transformMediaMentionCountData` are used to structure raw API data into the specific `series` and `categories` format required by ApexCharts, handling cases where data might be missing or incomplete.
*   **Styling and Layout:** The component utilizes Tailwind CSS extensively for its layout, responsiveness, and visual elements. It's enclosed in a `pdf-section` class, suggesting it's designed to be part of a PDF report generation feature. Consistent colors, font sizes, and spacing are applied throughout the component.
*   **Defensive Data Handling:** Numerous checks for `undefined`, `null`, or empty arrays (`!data.length`) are present before attempting to process data or render values, ensuring the component's robustness.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Chart-centric Display:** The component primarily leverages `react-apexcharts` for data visualization, configuring multiple chart types with similar option structures.
*   **Dynamic Data Processing:** A consistent pattern of transforming raw input data (from props) into a structured format suitable for charting.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Sections and data displays are often conditionally rendered based on `msSelectedComps` or the availability of data.
*   **Consistent UI/UX:** Repeated use of specific color palettes, font styles, and card designs for metrics, along with uniform axis and legend configurations across charts, creates a cohesive user experience.
*   **Error Prevention:** Frequent checks for `null` or `undefined` values in data props before rendering, along with `noData` messages for charts.
*   **Period Indication:** The display of a "period" (e.g., `({msPerformanceMetricPeriod?.period})`) consistently next to section titles suggests the report's content can be filtered by different timeframes.
