# Activity Summary for 11/27/2025

## 10:44:50 AM
In `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`, updated on 11/27/2025 at 9:52:41 AM, a React component named `MediaScore` was developed to display various media performance metrics and data visualizations.

**Key updates and functionalities:**

*   **Data Transformation Functions:** The component includes dedicated functions (`transformMediaImpactData`, `transformMediaMentionCountData`) to process raw data (e.g., `mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`) into a format suitable for charting. These functions extract unique categories (like months or mention types) and create data series, handling cases where data might be missing.
*   **ApexCharts Integration:** The component heavily utilizes `ReactApexChart` (dynamically imported for client-side rendering) to generate several types of charts:
    *   **Article Count Line Chart (`lineChartData`):** Displays article counts over time, grouped by brand, with custom styling for axes, legend, and tooltip.
    *   **Media Impact Line Chart (`impactLineChartData`):** Visualizes brand impact scores across months, including specific styling and a "No data available" message for empty states.
    *   **Media Mention Count Bar Chart (`mentionBarChartData`):** Presents stacked bar charts for different mention types over months, with similar styling conventions for axes, legend, and data handling.
    *   **Quality of Mentions Pie Chart (`qualityPieChartData`):** Shows the distribution of mention types using a donut chart, including data labels and a "No data available" fallback.
*   **Performance Metrics Section:** A conditionally rendered section (`msSelectedComps.includes("Performance Metrics")`) displays key performance indicators such as "Average Share of Voice" and "No of Mentions." Each metric shows its value and a `changePercent`, which is dynamically styled to appear green for positive changes and red for negative changes.
*   **Styling and Layout:** The component uses a responsive layout (`flex justify-between flex-col w-1/2 min-h-[841px]`) and consistent styling for sections, titles, and individual metric cards, primarily using Tailwind CSS classes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Charting:** A dominant pattern is the use of `ReactApexChart` for almost all data visualization needs within the component, showcasing different chart types.
*   **Consistent Chart Styling:** ApexCharts configurations frequently share common options like `toolbar: { show: false }`, specific `colors`, and detailed `xaxis`, `yaxis`, `legend`, and `grid` styling, often using black (`#000`) for labels and borders.
*   **Data Handling for Charts:** A recurring approach is to define `noData` options for charts, ensuring a user-friendly message when data is unavailable.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Sections of the report are conditionally rendered based on selected components (`msSelectedComps`) passed as props.
*   **Metric Display Format:** Performance metrics consistently show a value and a percentage change, with the percentage change dynamically colored based on its sign (positive/negative).
*   **Data Transformation Logic:** Many data processing steps involve iterating through data to extract unique categories (like months) and then mapping relevant counts or scores to these categories to form chart series.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx` was updated on `11/27/2025, 9:52:41 AM`.

This `MediaScore.jsx` file defines a React client component designed to render a detailed "Media Score" section within a brand report. Its primary function is to visualize various media performance metrics using dynamic charts and display key performance indicators.

**Key Updates and Functionality:**

*   **Charting Library**: Integrates `react-apexcharts` via `next/dynamic` for client-side rendering, enabling the creation of diverse chart types.
*   **Performance Metrics Display**:
    *   Includes a "Performance Metrics" section that is conditionally rendered based on the `msSelectedComps` prop.
    *   Displays "Average Share of Voice" and "No of Mentions" with their respective percentage changes (styled in green for positive, red for negative).
*   **Data Visualization Charts**:
    *   **Article Count Line Chart**: Visualizes `mediaArticleCountData`, showing brand-wise article counts over time, with months mapped to short names.
    *   **Media Impact Line Chart**: Displays `mediaImpactGraphData` showing media impact scores for different brands over months.
    *   **Media Mention Count Bar Chart**: A stacked bar chart presenting `mediaMentionCountData`, categorized by mention type (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and month.
    *   **Quality of Mentions Pie/Donut Chart**: Renders `qualityOfMentions` data as a donut chart, illustrating the distribution of mention types (e.g., positive, negative).
*   **Data Transformation**: Contains dedicated helper functions (`transformMediaImpactData`, `transformMediaMentionCountData`) to preprocess raw data into series and categories suitable for `react-apexcharts`.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Data Handling**: Many sections and data points are conditionally rendered or displayed with fallback values (`--`) if data is `undefined` or `null`, ensuring robustness.
*   **Styling**: Employs utility classes for layout (`flex`, `grid`, `w-1/2`, `p-6`) and visual presentation (`bg-white`, `rounded-lg`, `border-[#00000033]`), suggesting the use of a framework like Tailwind CSS.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Chart Configuration**: A recurring pattern is the extensive configuration of `react-apexcharts` options, including common settings for `chart` type, `colors`, `stroke`, `markers`, `xaxis`, `yaxis`, `legend` (typically `bottom`, `horizontalAlign: 'center'`, square markers), `grid` (`strokeDashArray: 4`), and `noData` message styling.
*   **Dynamic Data Processing**: The use of `Array.from(new Set(...))` to extract unique categories (like months or mention types) and then mapping data to create chart series is a common pattern for preparing data.
*   **Metric Styling**: Percentage changes in performance metrics consistently use conditional styling (green for `+`, red for `-`) to indicate trends.
*   **Font and Color Scheme**: Chart labels, axis texts, and general text often use `#000` or `#000000` for color, with `Inter, sans-serif` as the specified font family for some charts.
