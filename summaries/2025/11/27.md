# Activity Summary for 11/27/2025

## 10:44:50 AM
In `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`, updated on 11/27/2025 at 9:52:41 AM, a React component named `MediaScore` was developed to display various media performance metrics and data visualizations.

**Key updates and functionalities:**

*   **Data Transformation Functions:** The component includes dedicated functions (`transformMediaImpactData`, `transformMediaMentionCountData`) to process raw data (e.g., `mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`) into a format suitable for charting. These functions extract unique categories (like months or mention types) and create data series, handling cases where data might be missing.
*   **ApexCharts Integration:** The component heavily utilizes `ReactApexChart` (dynamically imported for client-side rendering) to generate several types of charts:
    *   **Article Count Line Chart (`lineChartData`):** Displays article counts over time, grouped by brand, with custom styling for axes, legend, and tooltip.
    *   **Media Impact Line Chart (`impactLineChartData`):** Visualizes brand impact scores across months, including specific styling and a "No data available" message for empty states.
    *   **Media Mention Count Bar Chart (`mentionBarChartData`):** Presents stacked bar charts for different mention types over months, with similar styling conventions for axes, legend, and data handling.
    *   **Quality of Mentions Pie Chart (`qualityPieChartData`):** Shows the distribution of mention types using a donut chart, including data labels and a "No data available" fallback.
*   **Performance Metrics Section:** A conditionally rendered section (`msSelectedComps.includes("Performance Metrics")`) displays key performance indicators such as "Average Share of Voice" and "No of Mentions." Each metric shows its value and a `changePercent`, which is dynamically styled to appear green for positive changes and red for negative changes.
*   **Styling and Layout:** The component uses a responsive layout (`flex justify-between flex-col w-1/2 min-h-[841px]`) and consistent styling for sections, titles, and individual metric cards, primarily using Tailwind CSS classes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Charting:** A dominant pattern is the use of `ReactApexChart` for almost all data visualization needs within the component, showcasing different chart types.
*   **Consistent Chart Styling:** ApexCharts configurations frequently share common options like `toolbar: { show: false }`, specific `colors`, and detailed `xaxis`, `yaxis`, `legend`, and `grid` styling, often using black (`#000`) for labels and borders.
*   **Data Handling for Charts:** A recurring approach is to define `noData` options for charts, ensuring a user-friendly message when data is unavailable.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Sections of the report are conditionally rendered based on selected components (`msSelectedComps`) passed as props.
*   **Metric Display Format:** Performance metrics consistently show a value and a percentage change, with the percentage change dynamically colored based on its sign (positive/negative).
*   **Data Transformation Logic:** Many data processing steps involve iterating through data to extract unique categories (like months) and then mapping relevant counts or scores to these categories to form chart series.
