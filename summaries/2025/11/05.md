# Activity Summary for 11/5/2025

## 12:00:49 AM
The `index.js` file, timestamped 11/4/2025, 12:38:03 PM, serves as the main entry point for a Crockery E-commerce Backend application.

**File-specific updates for `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com-Backend\index.js`:**

*   **Core Setup:** The file initializes an Express application, connects to a database, and configures environment variables using `dotenv`.
*   **Middleware Configuration:** It sets up `cookie-parser` and `cors` middleware. The CORS configuration is robust, allowing specific origins including local development (`localhost:5173`), Vercel deployments (`mnk-2025.vercel.app`), and Netlify deployments (`sprightly-baklava-2d3c9b.netlify.app`, `crockery-e-com-dashboard.netlify.app`), with credentials enabled.
*   **Payload Handling:** It significantly increases the JSON and URL-encoded payload limits to "100mb", suggesting the backend handles potentially large data submissions, possibly for image uploads or extensive product data.
*   **Route Management:** The application defines and integrates a comprehensive set of API routes, indicating a feature-rich e-commerce system. These routes include:
    *   `/api/category` for product categories.
    *   `/api/admin` for administrator functionalities, including customer management.
    *   `/api/customers` for general customer operations.
    *   `/api/products` for product-related actions.
    *   `/api/customer-orders` for order processing.
    *   `/api/customer-otp` for OTP-based customer authentication.
    *   `/api/customercartwishlist` for managing customer carts and wishlists.
    *   `/api/distributors` for distributor-specific operations.
    *   `/api/inquiries` for customer inquiries.
    *   `/api/razorpay` for payment gateway integration.
*   **Server Status Endpoint:** A basic GET route at `/` is provided to confirm the server's operational status.
*   **Server Initialization:** The application listens on a port defined in the environment variables.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Architecture:** A strong pattern of modularity is evident, with distinct functionalities (e.g., admin, customer, products, orders, payments) separated into individual route files, then imported and used in the main `index.js`.
*   **E-commerce Focus:** The sheer number and type of routes (products, orders, carts, wishlists, payments, customers, distributors) consistently point towards a backend designed specifically for an e-commerce platform.
*   **Frontend Integration:** The detailed CORS setup with multiple deployment environments (Vercel, Netlify, localhost) indicates that this backend is designed to serve multiple frontend applications or different deployment stages of a single frontend.
*   **API Naming Convention:** Routes generally follow a `/api/<resource>` or `/api/<resource>/<sub-resource>` pattern, promoting consistency.
