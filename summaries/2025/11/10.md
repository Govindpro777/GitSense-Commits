# Activity Summary for 11/10/2025

## 10:20:54 AM
A new `UserPanel` feature has been introduced and integrated into the application, involving a new Mongoose model, a dedicated controller, and API routes.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com-Backend\Models\UserPanel.js` (Timestamp: 11/8/2025, 1:28:10 AM):**
    *   A new Mongoose schema `UserPanel` was created.
    *   It defines fields for `name` (String, required, trimmed), `email` (String, required, unique, lowercase, trimmed), `password` (String, required), `modules` (Array of Strings, with a default list of application paths like `/categories`, `/users`, `/sales/orders`, etc.), and `isActive` (Boolean, default `true`).
    *   The schema is configured to automatically add `timestamps`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com-Backend\Controller\UserPanelController.js` (Timestamp: 11/8/2025, 1:28:59 AM):**
    *   This file introduces a comprehensive set of controller functions for managing `UserPanel` entries.
    *   `createUserPanel`: Handles new user panel creation, including checking for existing emails, hashing passwords using `bcryptjs`, and setting default modules if none are provided.
    *   `getAllUserPanels`, `getUserPanelById`: Retrieve user panels, consistently excluding the `password` field from the results.
    *   `updateUserPanel`: Allows updating various fields, including re-hashing the password if it's changed.
    *   `toggleUserPanelStatus`: Provides functionality to activate or deactivate a user panel.
    *   `deleteUserPanel`: Removes a user panel from the database.
    *   All functions include robust error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `400` for bad requests, `404` for not found, `500` for server errors).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com-Backend\Routes\userPanelRoutes.js`:**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/8/2025, 1:29:45 AM:** Initial setup of routes for `UserPanel` operations (`POST /`, `GET /`, `GET /:id`, `PUT /:id`, `PATCH /:id/status`, `DELETE /:id`). All these routes were initially protected by an `adminAuth` middleware.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/8/2025, 1:36:35 AM:** A significant change occurred where the `adminAuth` middleware was **removed from all `userPanelRoutes`**, making them publicly accessible or requiring other authentication mechanisms not specified in these logs.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/8/2025, 1:36:41 AM:** This entry shows no functional change from the previous timestamp, indicating a quick save or minor irrelevant edit.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ECOM\Crockery-E-com-Backend\index.js`:**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/8/2025, 1:32:08 AM:** The `UserPanelRoutes` were imported into the main application file, but **not yet integrated** via `app.use()`. The application already handles numerous other routes for categories, admins, customers, products, orders, etc. CORS is configured with a list of `allowedOrigins`, and payload size limits are increased to "100mb".
    *   **Timestamp: 11/8/2025, 1:32:22 AM:** The `UserPanelRoutes` were integrated into the Express application under the base path `/api/userpanel`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/8/2025, 1:37:48 AM:** The base path for `UserPanelRoutes` was updated from `/api/userpanel` to `/api/user-panel`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The bulk of the development for the `UserPanel` feature occurred within a concentrated period on **November 8, 2025, between 1:28 AM and 1:38 AM**. Key events include:
*   **1:28:10 AM:** Model definition.
*   **1:28:59 AM:** Controller logic implementation.
*   **1:29:45 AM:** Initial route definition (with admin authentication).
*   **1:32:22 AM:** Integration of the new routes into the main application.
*   **1:36:35 AM:** Removal of `adminAuth` middleware from `UserPanel` routes, a critical security change.
*   **1:37:48 AM:** Adjustment of the API base path for `UserPanel` routes.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Feature Development:** A clear pattern of developing a feature (`UserPanel`) across distinct layers (Model, Controller, Routes) before integrating it into the main `index.js` file.
*   **Security Practices:** Passwords are consistently hashed using `bcryptjs` in the controller, and sensitive information like passwords is excluded from API responses (`select("-password")`). However, there was a specific and immediate reversal in securing the `userPanelRoutes` by removing the `adminAuth` middleware.
*   **API Design Consistency:** Controllers use consistent error handling and response structures. Routes follow RESTful conventions.
*   **CORS and Payload Configuration:** The `index.js` file consistently configures CORS with `allowedOrigins` and increases payload limits to `100mb`, suggesting handling of large data or images.
*   **Backend Stack:** The project utilizes Mongoose for MongoDB interaction, Express.js for routing, bcryptjs for password hashing, and dotenv for environment variable management.

## 11:29:37 AM
The log details changes across three files within the Skribe-Backend project, primarily focusing on report generation and environment configuration.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\config.ts`** (Timestamp: 11/10/2025, 10:43:57 AM)
    This file defines environment-specific base URLs and image URLs for `development`, `preview`, and `production`. The `baseURL`s for `preview` and `production` have commented-out previous values (likely local or specific deployment URLs), indicating a shift to more generalized domains (`beta.goskribe.com` and `goskribe.com`). It also exports utility functions (`getBaseURL`, `getImageURL`, `isProduction`) to access these configurations based on the Vite environment mode.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\Narratives.tsx`**
    This React component is responsible for displaying "Brand Narrative" sections in a monthly report, including a timeline chart and individual narrative summaries.
    *   **11/10/2025, 10:47:28 AM:** The `yaxis` configuration for the `ReactApexChart` was updated to explicitly show labels, format them to integers (`toFixed(0)`), and apply black text styling. Previously, it was commented out or configured to hide labels.
    *   **11/10/2025, 11:11:29 AM:** Further refinement to the `yaxis` chart options included adding `min: 0` and `forceNiceScale: true` to ensure the chart's Y-axis always starts at zero and scales appropriately.
    *   **11/10/2025, 11:24:43 AM:** A bug was introduced where the `ReactApexChart`'s `series` prop was mistakenly changed from `{series}` to `{categories}`, which would cause rendering issues.
    *   **11/10/2025, 11:25:03 AM:** The bug from the previous change was immediately fixed, reverting the `ReactApexChart`'s `series` prop back to `{series}`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\CompetitorNarratives.tsx`**
    This React component mirrors the `Narratives.tsx` file but focuses on "Competitor Narrative" data, handling similar chart and narrative display logic.
    *   **11/10/2025, 10:48:36 AM:** Similar to `Narratives.tsx`, the `yaxis` configuration for the `ReactApexChart` was updated to show labels formatted as integers. It also includes logic to display a main "Competitor Narrative" title only for the first page (`index === 0`) and capitalizes the first word of the `competitorName`.
    *   **11/10/2025, 11:10:53 AM:** The `yaxis` chart options were updated with `min: 0` and `forceNiceScale: true` for better chart scaling, consistent with the change made in `Narratives.tsx`.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **11/10/2025, 10:43:57 AM:** Initial definition of environment configurations in `src\config.ts`.
*   **11/10/2025, 10:47:28 AM & 10:48:36 AM:** Initial functional improvements to Y-axis label display for charts in both `Narratives.tsx` and `CompetitorNarratives.tsx`.
*   **11/10/2025, 11:10:53 AM & 11:11:29 AM:** Introduction of explicit Y-axis scaling (`min: 0`, `forceNiceScale: true`) in both `CompetitorNarratives.tsx` and `Narratives.tsx` for improved chart presentation.
*   **11/10/2025, 11:24:43 AM & 11:25:03 AM:** A rapid sequence of introducing and then fixing a regression bug in the `ReactApexChart` series data within `Narratives.tsx`.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Consistent Chart Logic:** Both `Narratives.tsx` and `CompetitorNarratives.tsx` share almost identical `ReactApexChart` configurations, including `chartOptions` (colors, stroke, markers, grid, title, responsiveness) and the process of transforming narrative data into chart series and categories.
*   **Y-axis Refinements:** A recurring theme across both narrative report files is the continuous refinement of the chart's Y-axis display, moving from hidden or default labels to explicit integer-formatted labels and then to controlled scaling starting at zero.
*   **Report Structure and Styling:** Both `Narratives.tsx` and `CompetitorNarratives.tsx` utilize a consistent structure for report pages (`FirstPage`, `NarrativePage`) and extensive Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `pdf-section`, specific widths, background colors, borders, font sizes), indicating a standardized approach to generating visually consistent PDF-like reports.
*   **Frequent Saving:** There are several instances (e.g., `CompetitorNarratives.tsx` at 11:01:35 AM and `Narratives.tsx` at 11:01:51 AM and 11:11:48 AM, 11:13:24 AM) where a file's content appears identical to its immediately preceding entry, suggesting frequent saves during development.
