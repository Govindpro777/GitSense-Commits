# Activity Summary for 11/28/2025

## 10:31:04 AM

The logs detail changes made to a backend project, primarily focusing on server configuration and dependency management.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\backend1\server.js`**: This file underwent multiple modifications within a short timeframe.
    *   Initially, an Express server was set up to listen on `PORT 2000` (11/27/2025, 9:25:31 PM).
    *   The server's listening `PORT` was subsequently changed to `3000` (11/27/2025, 9:26:03 PM).
    *   It was then updated again to `PORT 4000` (11/27/2025, 9:29:43 PM).
    *   A minor change at (11/27/2025, 9:30:25 PM) introduced a typo in the console log message, changing "port" to "prt," while the `PORT` remained `4000`.
    *   The core structure of the server initialization using `express` remained consistent across all changes.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\backend1\package.json`**: This file was updated at 11/27/2025, 9:28:23 PM.
    *   It was configured to define the project as a `"type": "module"`.
    *   Key dependencies, `express` (version `^5.1.0`) and `mongoose` (version `^9.0.0`), were added to the project.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   The initial `server.js` setup occurred at **11/27/2025, 9:25:31 PM**.
*   The `package.json` was updated with dependencies and module type at **11/27/2025, 9:28:23 PM**.
*   The final `PORT` change and subsequent typo in `server.js` happened around **11/27/2025, 9:29:43 PM** and **9:30:25 PM**, respectively.
All changes took place within a narrow window of approximately five minutes on November 27, 2025.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Port Number Adjustments:** The `PORT` constant in `server.js` was frequently modified (2000 -> 3000 -> 4000), indicating iterative setup or testing of the server's listening port.
*   **Consistent Server Setup:** The use of `import express from "express"; const app = express();` followed by `app.listen()` is a recurring pattern for initializing the Express server.
*   **Backend Focus:** The changes primarily revolve around setting up a basic Node.js Express server and managing its core dependencies (`express`, `mongoose`), typical for a backend application initialization.
