# Activity Summary for 11/28/2025

## 10:31:04 AM

The logs detail changes made to a backend project, primarily focusing on server configuration and dependency management.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\backend1\server.js`**: This file underwent multiple modifications within a short timeframe.
    *   Initially, an Express server was set up to listen on `PORT 2000` (11/27/2025, 9:25:31 PM).
    *   The server's listening `PORT` was subsequently changed to `3000` (11/27/2025, 9:26:03 PM).
    *   It was then updated again to `PORT 4000` (11/27/2025, 9:29:43 PM).
    *   A minor change at (11/27/2025, 9:30:25 PM) introduced a typo in the console log message, changing "port" to "prt," while the `PORT` remained `4000`.
    *   The core structure of the server initialization using `express` remained consistent across all changes.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\backend1\package.json`**: This file was updated at 11/27/2025, 9:28:23 PM.
    *   It was configured to define the project as a `"type": "module"`.
    *   Key dependencies, `express` (version `^5.1.0`) and `mongoose` (version `^9.0.0`), were added to the project.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   The initial `server.js` setup occurred at **11/27/2025, 9:25:31 PM**.
*   The `package.json` was updated with dependencies and module type at **11/27/2025, 9:28:23 PM**.
*   The final `PORT` change and subsequent typo in `server.js` happened around **11/27/2025, 9:29:43 PM** and **9:30:25 PM**, respectively.
All changes took place within a narrow window of approximately five minutes on November 27, 2025.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Port Number Adjustments:** The `PORT` constant in `server.js` was frequently modified (2000 -> 3000 -> 4000), indicating iterative setup or testing of the server's listening port.
*   **Consistent Server Setup:** The use of `import express from "express"; const app = express();` followed by `app.listen()` is a recurring pattern for initializing the Express server.
*   **Backend Focus:** The changes primarily revolve around setting up a basic Node.js Express server and managing its core dependencies (`express`, `mongoose`), typical for a backend application initialization.

## 10:31:14 AM
The provided logs detail recent changes across several API route definition files for an E-commerce application, all timestamped on 11/27/2025, between 10:31 PM and 10:33 PM, indicating a concentrated burst of development activity.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\routes\userRoutes.js` (11/27/2025, 10:31:17 PM)**:
    *   Defines comprehensive API endpoints for user management, including creation (`POST /`), retrieval of all users (`GET /`), retrieval by ID (`GET /:id`), updating (`PUT /:id`), activation (`PATCH /:id/activate`), and deletion (`DELETE /:id`).
    *   Access is heavily controlled by `authenticate` and `authorize` middleware, primarily granting "admin" and "userpannel" roles access to most management functions, while "customer" role is also included for user updates.
    *   Input validation is enforced using `validate(createUserSchema)` and `validate(updateUserSchema)`.
    *   Extensive Swagger documentation is present for `/api/users` and `/api/users/{id}` endpoints.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\routes\supportRoutes.js` (11/27/2025, 10:32:21 PM)**:
    *   Establishes API routes for managing support tickets, covering creation (`POST /`), retrieving tickets by customer (`GET /customer/:customerId`), getting all tickets (`GET /`), getting a specific ticket by ID (`GET /:id`), updating (`PUT /:id`), changing status (`PATCH /:id/status`), and deletion (`DELETE /:id`).
    *   Ticket creation is authorized for "customer" role, while management (get all, get by ID, update, change status, delete) is restricted to "admin" and "userpannel" roles.
    *   Input validation uses `validate(supportSchema)`.
    *   Includes Swagger documentation for `/api/support` and `/api/support/{id}`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\routes\productRoutes.js` (11/27/2025, 10:33:01 PM)**:
    *   Manages product-related API endpoints, including product creation (`POST /createproduct`), retrieving all products (`GET /getallproducts`), active products (`GET /getactiveproducts`), best-seller products (`GET /getbestsellerproducts`), product by ID (`GET /getproductbyid/:id`), updating (`PUT /updateproduct/:id`), deleting (`DELETE /deleteproduct/:id`), toggling status (`PATCH /togglestatus/:id`), toggling best-seller status (`PATCH /togglebestseller/:id`), toggling product visibility (`PATCH /togglehide/:id`), and updating stock (`POST /:id/stock`).
    *   Product creation and updates involve `multer` middleware (`upload.array("productImages", 5)`) for handling multiple image uploads.
    *   Authorization for most management tasks (create, update, delete, toggles, stock update) is for "admin" and "userpannel" roles. Public GET routes (all, active, best-seller, by ID) do not require authorization.
    *   Uses `validate(productSchema)` for input validation.
    *   Swagger documentation covers `/api/products/createproduct` and `/api/products/getallproducts`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\routes\razorpayRoutes.js` (11/27/2025, 10:33:11 PM)**:
    *   Implements API routes for Razorpay payment gateway integration, specifically for creating an order (`POST /create-order`) and verifying payment (`POST /verify`).
    *   Both endpoints require user authentication but no specific role-based authorization is specified beyond `authenticate`.
    *   Swagger documentation details the request bodies for amount (create order) and Razorpay payment details (verify).

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\routes\orderRoutes.js` (11/27/2025, 10:33:34 PM)**:
    *   Defines API routes for comprehensive order management, including order creation by admin/userpannel (`POST /createOrder`), order creation by customer (`POST /createOrderByCustomer`), retrieving all orders (`GET /getAllOrders`), order summaries (`GET /summary`), customer-specific order summaries (`GET /customer`), orders by customer ID (`GET /getOrdersByCustomerId/:id`), order by ID (`GET /getOrders/:id`), generating an invoice (`GET /:id/invoice`), updating orders (`PATCH /updateOrdersById/:id`), changing order status (`PATCH /updateOrdersStatus/:id/status`), and deleting orders (`DELETE /:id`).
    *   Authorization varies: "admin" and "userpannel" for most management and summary functions, "customer" for creating their own orders and viewing their summaries. Order deletion is solely for "admin".
    *   Validation is implemented with `validate(orderSchema)` and `validate(customerOrderSchema)`.
    *   Swagger documentation is provided for `/api/orders/createOrder` and `/api/orders/getAllOrders`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Standardized Route Structure**: All files follow a consistent pattern for defining API routes using `express.Router()`.
*   **Middleware Consistency**:
    *   The `authenticate` middleware is almost universally applied to ensure users are logged in before accessing protected resources.
    *   The `authorize` middleware is extensively used across all files to enforce role-based access control, typically differentiating between "admin", "userpannel", and "customer" roles.
    *   The `validate` middleware is consistently used with specific Joi schemas (e.g., `createUserSchema`, `supportSchema`, `productSchema`, `orderSchema`) to validate incoming request bodies, ensuring data integrity.
*   **E-commerce Domain**: The routes clearly cover core E-commerce functionalities, including user accounts, product catalog, customer support, payment processing, and order management.
*   **Swagger Documentation**: All files include detailed Swagger annotations for their endpoints, indicating a strong emphasis on API documentation and discoverability. This includes tags, summaries, request body schemas, and response structures.
*   **CRUD Operations**: Each resource (users, support tickets, products, orders) provides a full set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, often with additional specific actions (e.g., activate user, toggle product status, change order status, generate invoice).
*   **Centralized Middleware/Controllers**: All routes import their respective controller functions, authentication/authorization/validation middleware, and validation schemas from central `../controllers`, `../middlewares`, and `../utils/validationSchemas` directories, promoting modularity and reusability.

## 11:44:18 AM
The code change log primarily details updates across two files, `src\constants.js` and `src\components\Brand\Overview\Overview.jsx`, all occurring on 11/28/2025.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\constants.js`**
- **Timestamp:** 11/28/2025, 11:05:39 AM
- **Updates:** This file defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints as `export const` variables. Most base URLs (`Url_V1`, `url`, `ATTACH_URL`, `CHAI_TIME`, `RESETPASS`, `SOCIALURL`) are dynamically sourced from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables, indicating a flexible configuration for different deployment environments. The file covers endpoints for authentication (login, signup, password reset, token management), user preferences (CRM, geo, media type, beats, competitors, topics, brands, spokespersons), campaign management (create, get, delete lists and campaigns, email quota, send mail), reporting (brand, influencer, spokesperson, topic articles/aggregations), search functionalities, and various dashboard/pre-login features (podcast, contact form, Instagram, Twitter, Geo stats). A `STATICCOUNT` of 1000 is defined for "select all" buttons. This entry reflects a stable and extensive API constant definition prior to other changes.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Overview\Overview.jsx`**
This React component underwent a series of iterative changes, mainly focused on introducing and refining a file upload feature for brand data.

- **Initial State (11/28/2025, 11:06:02 AM):** The component, named `Overview`, is a brand dashboard displaying various performance metrics (Average Share of Voice, No of Mentions, Sentiment Score, Media Impact Score) fetched from several API endpoints. It utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage data and UI state, including `periodOptions` for data range selection and `graphOptions` for chart types. It renders `BrandHeader`, `Spokesperson`, `MediaArticleCount`, `AIGeneratedOpinion`, `QualityOfMentionsSplit`, `DropdownComponent`, `MediaMentionsChart`, `MonthlyMentionChart`, `MultiSelectDropdown`, and displays brand-specific data like `brandData?.image` and `brandData?.brandName`. A placeholder message is shown if `brandStatus` is false.
- **Intermediate Changes (11/28/2025, 11:11:37 AM - 11:29:29 AM):**
    - **11:11:37 AM:** An erroneous and incomplete `useEffect` block for fetching sentiment score was temporarily introduced.
    - **11:15:50 AM:** The erroneous `useEffect` was removed. A basic, unstyled `<input type="file" />` was added to the header.
    - **11:16:54 AM:** No functional change.
    - **11:22:36 AM:** The file input was hidden (`className="hidden"`) and an "Upload Data" button was added, configured to trigger the hidden input. An SVG icon was included in the button. The `onChange` handler for the input was a `console.log`.
    - **11:22:43 AM:** The SVG icon from the "Upload Data" button was removed.
    - **11:23:07 AM:** A typo changed `className="hidden"` to `className="h"` for the input, likely making it visible.
    - **11:23:35 AM:** The layout of the header was adjusted using `justify-between` to correctly position the "Upload Data" button to the right, and the `input type="file"`'s class was corrected back to `hidden`.
    - **11:23:55 AM:** Minor structural change: the brand image and title were wrapped in a `div`. The `ml-auto` class on the button was removed.
    - **11:24:19 AM:** The `ml-auto` class was re-added to the "Upload Data" button for consistent right alignment.
    - **11:24:46 AM:** The "Upload Data" button's background color was changed from `bg-blue-500` to `bg-[#318FFF]`, and `cursor-pointer` was explicitly added.
    - **11:26:03 AM:** An `img` tag with `src="/assets/cloud.svg"` was added back to the "Upload Data" button, restoring the cloud icon.
    - **11:29:29 AM:**
        - An incorrect `import use` was added (later removed).
        - A new `file` state variable (`useState(null)`) was introduced to store the selected file.
        - An initial `useEffect` was added for `uploadFile`, which attempted to send a file via `axios.post` to `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE` (incorrect endpoint at this stage), but was not yet functional due to missing imports and an empty dependency array. The `onChange` for the input still `console.log`ed the file.
- **Refinement and Functional Implementation (11/28/2025, 11:32:19 AM - 11:43:03 AM):**
    - **11:32:19 AM:** `axios` and `tokenService` were imported. The `uploadFile` `useEffect` was updated to correctly post to `UPLOAD_BRAND_CSV` with authentication headers, but still had an empty dependency array.
    - **11:33:22 AM:** The `UPLOAD_BRAND_CSV` endpoint URL was modified to include `?brand_name=${brandData?.brandName}`. A syntax error was introduced where the `catch` block was incorrectly placed after an `if` statement.
    - **11:33:39 AM:** The success check for the upload was changed to `res?.success === "Ok"`. The syntax error persisted.
    - **11:34:54 AM:** The success check was updated to `res?.data?.success === true`. The syntax error persisted, and the erroneous `import use` reappeared.
    - **11:35:39 AM:** `useNotification` was imported, and `showNotification` was used to display a success message upon file upload. The erroneous `import use` was removed. The `try...catch` syntax error remained.
    - **11:35:59 AM:** The success notification message was slightly revised. The `try...catch` syntax error remained.
    - **11:38:41 AM:** This was a significant correction:
        - The `uploadFile` `useEffect`'s `try...catch` block was correctly structured.
        - The `uploadFile()` function was explicitly called within its `useEffect`, and `[file]` was added as a dependency, ensuring the upload logic runs when a file is selected.
        - The `onChange` handler for the `fileUpload` input was changed to `setFile(e.target.files[0])`, correctly updating the state with the selected file.
        - An error notification `showNotification("Error uploading brand CSV file.", "error");` was added to the `catch` block.
    - **11:41:41 AM:** After a successful file upload, the `fileUpload` input value and `file` state are reset to `null` to allow re-uploading the same file.
    - **11:43:03 AM:** The file input was constrained to accept only CSV files using `accept=".csv"`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Iterative Development:** The `Overview.jsx` file shows a clear pattern of iterative development, with small, focused changes (UI adjustments, state management, API integration, error handling, input refinement) being committed frequently over a short period to implement a new file upload feature.
- **API Communication:** Both files demonstrate a reliance on API endpoints for data, with `constants.js` defining the URLs and `Overview.jsx` consuming them.
- **Error Handling and User Feedback:** The evolution of the file upload feature in `Overview.jsx` highlights the progressive addition of robust error handling (console logs, `try...catch`) and user feedback mechanisms (success/error notifications).
- **React Hooks Usage:** `useState` and `useEffect` are central to the `Overview.jsx` component's functionality, managing component state and side effects like data fetching and file uploads.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** The use of utility classes for styling (`bg-blue-500`, `text-white`, `rounded-md`, `flex`, `gap-3`, `justify-between`, `ml-auto`) is consistent throughout the UI modifications in `Overview.jsx`.

## 3:44:06 PM
The provided log details changes across four JavaScript files within the `skribefrontend` directory, primarily focusing on `Overview.jsx` and various report components.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Overview\Overview.jsx` (Extensive Changes)**
    *   **11/28/2025, 11:49:27 AM to 11:55:10 AM:** Initial code snippets reveal consistent functionality for displaying brand performance metrics (Share of Voice, Number of Mentions, Sentiment Score), handling CSV file uploads with validation errors, and fetching data from various `userService` endpoints based on a selected time `period`. There are minor, iterative formatting adjustments within the error table display (e.g., `dark:border-red-700`, `dark:text-red-200` classes being added or removed, and font weight changes for table headers). The `Sentiment Score` display logic was also refined to ensure the percentage symbol is appended when data is available.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:19:14 PM:** A "Download" button was added to the header section, positioned before the existing "Upload Data" button.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:21:46 PM:** The "Download" button's `src` for its icon was changed from `/assets/cloud.svg` to `/assets/downlaod-btn.svg`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:22:11 PM:** The "Download" button's styling was modified, changing its background from `bg-[#318FFF]` to `bg-[#F2F5FA]` and its text color from `text-white` to `text-black`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:22:39 PM:** The "Download" button's `ml-auto` class was removed, and the "Upload Data" button had `ml-auto` removed, indicating a potential re-arrangement of buttons where the "Download" button now takes the `ml-auto` styling to push itself to the right.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:23:06 PM:** Padding for both "Download" and "Upload Data" buttons changed from `px-4` to `px-6`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:23:23 PM:** The `onClick` handler was removed from the "Upload Data" button, shifting the logic to the hidden input element directly. However, subsequent logs show it was re-added.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:26:43 PM:** Introduced new `useState` hooks (`showDownloadMenu`, `showPopup`, `popupMessage`) and a `useRef` hook (`downloadRef`) for managing a dropdown menu and a success/error popup. The `downloadRef` is used to detect clicks outside the dropdown to close it.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:27:04 PM:** Implemented a dropdown menu for the "Download" button, allowing users to "Print Sample Data" or "Broadcast Sample Data" via direct CSV file downloads.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:27:50 PM:** Added `text-sm` class to the dropdown menu items for "Print Sample Data" and "Broadcast Sample Data." The width of the dropdown was also fixed to `w-48`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:28:00 PM:** Adjusted the dropdown width to `w-44` and fixed a `whitespace-nowrap` class for "Broadcast Sample Data" button.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:28:27 PM:** Added `whitespace-nowrap` class to the "Broadcast Sample Data" button within the download dropdown for better display.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:29:36 PM:** Integrated `useRef` into the component import for `downloadRef`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:29:46 PM:** Added a `useEffect` hook to handle clicks outside the `downloadRef` to close the `showDownloadMenu`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:30:00 PM:** Wrapped the download button and its dropdown menu in a `div` with `ref={downloadRef}` to enable the click-outside-to-close functionality.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:30:26 PM:** Minor style adjustment for the "Broadcast Sample Data" button, reducing padding from `px-4 py-2` to just `px-4`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:35:43 PM:** Introduced another `useRef` for `popupRef` and added a `useEffect` to close the `showPopup` on outside clicks. The success message for file upload now uses `setPopupMessage` and `setShowPopup(true)` instead of `showNotification`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:35:59 PM:** Added a `handleClickOutside` listener for `popupRef`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:36:35 PM:** The message for successful file upload (`res?.data?.detail?.message`) is now extracted and displayed in the custom popup.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:38:36 PM:** Changed the popup message source from `res?.data?.detail?.message` to `res?.data?.data?.message`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:39:43 PM:** Refined the custom popup structure, adding a header ("Message") and an "OK" button to close it. The background overlay was adjusted from `backdrop-blur-sm` to `bg-black/30`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:40:08 PM:** Adjusted the z-index of the popup overlay to `z-[10]` and the modal box to `z-[85]`. Further styling for the close button, header, and message was introduced.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:40:49 PM:** Changed the `z-index` of the popup overlay to `z-[100]`. Removed the "OK" button from inside the modal structure and relied on the outside click handler and the close button.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:41:00 PM:** Re-added the "OK" button to the popup and streamlined its content. The `h2` for the popup title was changed to "Success".
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:41:17 PM:** Added a green checkmark icon (`/assets/green-check.svg`) to the success popup, centered it, and adjusted text colors and margins.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:44:04 PM:** Consolidated `handleClickOutside` logic for both `downloadRef` and `popupRef` into a single `useEffect`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:44:17 PM:** Centered the green checkmark icon in the success popup.
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:49:10 PM:** Changed the `href` and `download` attributes for the "Broadcast Sample Data" button to "Broadcast-Sample-Data.csv".
    *   **11/28/2025, 12:50:53 PM:** Changed the `href` and `download` attributes for the "Print Sample Data" button to "Print-Sample-data.csv".
    *   **11/28/2025, 1:02:32 PM - 1:18:10 PM:** These entries consistently revolve around minor styling refinements for the success popup:
        *   Adjusting z-index values, button styles, font sizes, and image dimensions.
        *   The overall layout and functionality of the upload/download features, data fetching for brand metrics, and conditional rendering based on `brandStatus` remain constant.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:09:05 PM:** Initial structure for a catalog report component, displaying a list of articles with website, title, summary, publish date, and sentiment.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:17:03 PM:** Sentiment display was duplicated within the `ArticleCard`, appearing once after the website and again within the `flex items-center` div.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:18:05 PM:** The first sentiment display (after `vchwebsite`) was repositioned to `ml-auto`, aligning it to the right.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:19:58 PM:** Encapsulated the website and the first sentiment display within a `div` with `flex items-center justify-between` to correctly align them on the same line.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:21:12 PM:** The duplicated sentiment display from within the `flex items-center` div was removed, leaving only the one correctly positioned next to the website.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:21:29 PM & 3:21:46 PM:** Added a `mb-2` class to the `div` containing the website and sentiment, and `mb-1` to the paragraph containing the website.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:25:14 PM:** Increased the font size of `article.vchwebsite` to `text-[13px]`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:25:38 PM:** Decreased the font size of `article.vchtitle` to `text-[12px]`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:25:52 PM & 3:26:16 PM:** Adjusted `mb-1` to the parent `div` containing `vchwebsite` and `vchsentiment`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:09:15 PM:** Initial implementation of the MediaScore report, including ApexCharts for various metrics (impact score, article count, mention count, quality of mentions) and a "Performance Metrics" section. Styles for chart labels, borders, and legends are defined.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:09:25 PM:** Initial implementation of the Sentiment report, featuring AI Insights, Performance Metrics, and Comparative Analysis sections with ApexCharts for sentiment distribution.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:09:33 PM:** Initial implementation of the Share of Voice report, displaying various charts (bar and pie) for Share of Voice, Mentions, Reach, and Average Share of Voice, along with tables for top journalists.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:29:22 PM:** Adjusted the table header styling for "Journalist Name" in the "Top Journalists" sections to include `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent wrapping.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:29:54 PM:** Adjusted `px` padding in table headers for "Top Journalists (Brand)" from `px-3` to `px-2`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:30:35 PM:** Modified the font size for the "Top Journalists (Competition)" table headers from `text-[9px]` to `text-[8px]`.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:31:07 PM & 3:34:23 PM:** Added `items-stretch h-full` to the grid containing the two "Top Journalists" tables, ensuring they stretch to equal height.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:37:53 PM & 3:38:38 PM:** Commented out a block of code related to `averageChartData` and introduced a new, more detailed configuration for it, adding `minAngleToShowLabel`, `offset`, `formatter` for data labels, and `stroke` for pie chart slices.
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:39:09 PM & 3:39:20 PM:** Further refined styling for the top journalists tables, including adding `h-full` to the `table` elements.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:09:45 PM:** Initial implementation of the Spokesperson Report, including components for spokesperson mention count, number of mentions, sentiment score (using `ReactSpeedometer`), and top spokespersons with a table displaying their details and mentions.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\GenerateReport\GenerateReport.jsx`**
    *   **11/28/2025, 3:18:42 PM & 3:19:03 PM:** These logs indicate the initial setup for a report generation page. It includes various state variables for different report sections (Media Score, Sentiment, Share of Voice, Spokesperson, Catalog), each with options for selecting components and time periods. It also includes functionality for generating a PDF report using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro` and handling file uploads for brand data.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/28/2025, 11:49:27 AM - 11:55:10 AM:** Initial development and styling of the `Overview.jsx` component, including data display and CSV upload error handling.
*   **11/28/2025, 12:19:14 PM:** Introduction of a "Download" button in `Overview.jsx`.
*   **11/28/2025, 12:26:43 PM - 12:49:10 PM:** Implementation and iterative refinement of the download functionality in `Overview.jsx`, including adding a dropdown menu with sample data download links and a custom success/error popup modal for file uploads. This also involved refactoring the click-outside-to-close logic for both dropdown and popup into a single `useEffect`.
*   **11/28/2025, 3:09:05 PM - 3:09:45 PM:** Initial creation of the four report components: `CatelogReport.jsx`, `MediaScore.jsx`, `Sentiment.jsx`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`, setting up their basic structure and data display.
*   **11/28/2025, 3:17:03 PM - 3:26:16 PM:** Significant refactoring and styling adjustments within `CatelogReport.jsx`, particularly concerning the layout and typography of individual article cards.
*   **11/28/2025, 3:29:22 PM - 3:39:20 PM:** Refinements and styling updates in `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`, focusing on table header formatting, table height, and a major overhaul of the `averageChartData` configuration for enhanced visual representation (labels, offsets, strokes).
*   **11/28/2025, 3:18:42 PM - 3:19:03 PM:** Initial development of `GenerateReport.jsx`, establishing the state management for selecting report components and date ranges, and setting up the PDF generation logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **React Component Structure:** All files are React components using `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` hooks for state management, side effects, and DOM interaction.
*   **Data Fetching:** A consistent pattern of fetching data from `userService.get` endpoints (`GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_NO_OF_MENTIONS`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`) is observed, often triggered by changes in a `period` state variable.
*   **Loading Skeletons:** `react-loading-skeleton` is used for visual feedback while data is being loaded, indicating an emphasis on user experience.
*   **Error Handling and Notifications:** A custom `useNotification` hook is used for displaying success/error messages. File uploads include explicit error detail display, suggesting robust error reporting for CSV validation issues.
*   **Styling (Tailwind CSS-like):** Extensive use of utility classes (e.g., `flex`, `items-center`, `justify-between`, `px-4`, `py-2`, `rounded-md`, `text-sm`, `font-semibold`, `bg-white`, `border`, `shadow`) indicates a component-based styling approach, likely using Tailwind CSS.
*   **CSV File Upload/Download:** The `Overview.jsx` component consistently handles CSV file uploads to a `UPLOAD_BRAND_CSV` endpoint, and `GenerateReport.jsx` provides functionality to download sample CSV data files.
*   **Dynamic Charting:** `react-apexcharts` and `react-d3-speedometer` are dynamically imported in report components, suggesting interactive data visualizations are a core feature.
*   **PDF Generation:** `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro` are used for generating PDF reports, including embedding links. A common utility `applyStyle`/`removeStyle` is used to fix rendering issues during PDF conversion.
*   **"No Data Available" Fallbacks:** Most components include conditional rendering to display "No data available" messages when relevant data arrays are empty, ensuring a graceful user experience.
*   **Date/Time Period Selection:** Several components use `periodOptions`, `monthOptions`, and `timePeriodOptions` for filtering data by different time spans (e.g., "Last 1 month", "Previous 3 months", "Custom Date Range").
*   **Dropdown Menu Management:** Custom dropdown menus are implemented with `useState` and `useRef` to handle opening/closing and clicking outside to dismiss.
*   **Success/Error Popups:** A custom popup component is implemented and refined in `Overview.jsx` to provide visual feedback for file upload operations, eventually including a success icon and improved styling.
