# Activity Summary for 11/24/2025

## 8:59:04 AM
The `app.js` file, updated on 11/22/2025 at 4:09:13 PM, outlines the core configuration for an Express.js application. Key updates include:

*   **Enhanced CORS Configuration**: A significant change involves a more restrictive and explicit Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) setup. Instead of a general allowance, a specific `allowedOrigins` array is defined. This array includes local development URLs (`http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:8000`), production domains (`https://app.manmitr.com`, `http://manmitr.com`, `https://api.manmitr.com`), and deployment URLs on Render (`https://kidmantree-backend-g2la.onrender.com`, `https://manmitr.onrender.com`). The application now checks incoming requests against this whitelist, providing tighter security control.
*   **Rate Limiting**: An `express-rate-limit` middleware has been implemented for `/api` routes. This limits the number of requests per IP address within a specified window, configurable via environment variables (`RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`), defaulting to 100 requests every 15 minutes, to prevent abuse.
*   **Health Check Endpoint**: A new `/health` GET endpoint has been added. This endpoint provides basic application status information, including "OK" status, a timestamp, uptime, and the current environment, which is crucial for monitoring and deployment health checks.
*   **Security Middleware**: `helmet` is used with a `crossOriginResourcePolicy` set to `cross-origin`, allowing resources like images to be consumed across different origins.
*   **Logging and Error Handling**: Standard middleware for request logging (using `morgan` streamed to a custom `logger`) and comprehensive error handling (`notFoundHandler`, `errorHandler`) are in place.
*   **Static File Serving**: The application is configured to serve static files from an `/uploads` directory under the `/uploads` route.
*   **API Documentation**: Integration with Swagger (`setupSwagger(app)`) is present for API documentation generation.

A recurring pattern observed in this configuration is the heavy reliance on environment variables (e.g., `process.env.FRONTEND_URL`, `process.env.RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `process.env.NODE_ENV`) for various settings, promoting flexibility and ease of deployment across different environments. The inclusion of `manmitr.com` related URLs alongside `kidmantree-backend` in the CORS origins suggests potential inter-project communication or a shared infrastructure/related projects.

## 9:59:00 AM
The `app.js` file underwent significant updates on 11/22/2025, 4:09:13 PM, primarily focusing on security, performance, and application setup:

*   **CORS Configuration Refinement**: The `cors` middleware was updated to use a dynamic `origin` function, checking against an `allowedOrigins` array. This array now includes a broader set of domains, such as `localhost` variants (3000, 5173, 8000), specific production domains like `app.manmitr.com`, `http://manmitr.com`, `https://api.manmitr.com`, and render deployment URLs (`https://kidmantree-backend-g2la.onrender.com`, `https://manmitr.onrender.com`), indicating support for diverse development and deployment environments.
*   **Rate Limiting Implementation**: `express-rate-limit` was introduced and applied to all `/api` routes. The rate limit window and maximum requests are configurable via environment variables (`RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`), defaulting to 15 minutes and 100 requests respectively.
*   **Security Enhancements**: `helmet` middleware was configured to set various HTTP headers for security, specifically allowing cross-origin resource policy for `cross-origin`.
*   **Performance & Body Parsing**: `compression` middleware was added for GZIP compression, and `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` were configured with a `10mb` limit for request body parsing.
*   **Centralized Logging**: `morgan` was integrated for request logging, using the `combined` format and streaming output to a custom `logger.info` function, ensuring consistent logging practices.
*   **Static File Serving**: An endpoint `/uploads` was created to serve static files from the `uploads` directory.
*   **API Structure & Documentation**: All API routes are now mounted under `/api` using a `routes` module, and Swagger documentation setup (`setupSwagger`) is integrated.
*   **Health Check Endpoint**: A new `/health` GET endpoint was added, providing basic application status, timestamp, uptime, and environment information for monitoring purposes.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Dedicated `notFoundHandler` and `errorHandler` middlewares are applied at the end of the middleware chain for comprehensive error management.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements**:
A strong pattern of using environment variables for configuration (e.g., `FRONTEND_URL`, `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `NODE_ENV`) is evident, promoting flexibility and easy adaptation across different deployment environments. There is also a consistent focus on security (Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting) and operational best practices (logging, health checks, structured error handling).

## 10:16:46 AM
The code changes log details updates across several frontend files, primarily focusing on report generation and styling, all occurring within a concentrated period on November 24, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **9:17:06 AM:** The `Report` component initially rendered only `ShareOfVoiceReport`, with commented-out code indicating it previously included `MediaScore` and `Sentiment`.
    *   **9:18:24 AM:** A significant feature addition introduced PDF download functionality. This involved importing `useRef`, `html2canvas`, and `jspdf`, implementing an asynchronous `downloadPDF` function, and adding a button to trigger it. The `ShareOfVoiceReport` component was targeted for PDF export.
    *   **9:20:45 AM:** The `"use client";` directive was added to designate the component for client-side rendering.
    *   **9:28:14 AM - 9:32:01 AM:** A brief change and reversion occurred, where a `pdf-export` class was added to the exportable `div` and then removed.
    *   **9:46:37 AM:** The PDF generation functionality and related imports were completely removed. The `Report` component was reverted to its earlier structure, now importing and rendering `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport` directly. The `"use client";` directive was also removed.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\app\globals.css`**
    *   **9:27:22 AM - 9:27:39 AM:** This file contains extensive global CSS definitions. Key elements include Tailwind CSS imports, `Poppins` font family for `html`, `body`, Quill editor, and ApexCharts, responsive table styles, a CSS animation for `slide`, custom scrollbar styles, and specific styling for various UI components (swiper, dialogs, multiselect, TinyMCE editor, tooltips). A large section of background image styles for "HOME PAGE1" and "DATABASE PAGE" were present but commented out. There were no functional changes between the two timestamps for this file, suggesting a re-save or minor, non-functional edit.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **10:08:05 AM:** This component was introduced or significantly updated. It's a client-side component (`"use client";`) that dynamically imports `react-apexcharts`. It displays a detailed sentiment report, including performance metrics, comparative analysis with bar charts, and narrative summaries for both the company and its competitors. The component's structure and use of `pdf-section` and `min-h-[841px]` suggest it's designed to be part of a printable PDF report.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **10:08:42 AM - 10:08:59 AM:** Similar to `Sentiment.jsx`, this component was introduced or significantly updated. It is also a client-side component (`"use client";`) that dynamically imports `react-apexcharts`. It provides a comprehensive Share of Voice report featuring a bar chart for monthly share, pie charts for share by mentions, reach, and average share, along with tables detailing top journalists for the brand and its competitors. The component's styling (e.g., `pdf-section`, `min-h-[841px]`) indicates it's also prepared for PDF export. No functional changes were observed between the two timestamps.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Focused Development Session:** All changes occurred on November 24, 2025, primarily between 9:17 AM and 10:09 AM, indicating a concentrated effort on report features.
*   **Report Generation and Display:** A major theme is the development and structuring of analytical reports (`SentimentReport`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`).
*   **PDF Export Intent:** Although PDF export logic was added and then removed from the main `Report.jsx` component, the individual report components (`Sentiment.jsx`, `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`) are clearly designed for PDF output (e.g., `pdf-section` class, fixed heights). This suggests a shift in where the PDF generation logic is handled or a temporary rollback.
*   **Client-Side Rendering (Next.js):** The consistent use of `"use client";` (at least temporarily in `Report.jsx` and persistently in `Sentiment.jsx` and `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`) indicates these are client components within a Next.js application.
*   **Dynamic Imports for Charting:** Both `Sentiment.jsx` and `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx` utilize `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` for `react-apexcharts`, ensuring that charting libraries are loaded client-side and not during server-side rendering.
*   **Static Data for Reports:** The report components rely on extensive static data objects (e.g., `performanceMetrics`, `shareOfVoiceData`) within their code, likely for demonstration or initial development before integration with an actual data source.
