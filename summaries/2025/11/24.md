# Activity Summary for 11/24/2025

## 8:59:04 AM
The `app.js` file, updated on 11/22/2025 at 4:09:13 PM, outlines the core configuration for an Express.js application. Key updates include:

*   **Enhanced CORS Configuration**: A significant change involves a more restrictive and explicit Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) setup. Instead of a general allowance, a specific `allowedOrigins` array is defined. This array includes local development URLs (`http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:8000`), production domains (`https://app.manmitr.com`, `http://manmitr.com`, `https://api.manmitr.com`), and deployment URLs on Render (`https://kidmantree-backend-g2la.onrender.com`, `https://manmitr.onrender.com`). The application now checks incoming requests against this whitelist, providing tighter security control.
*   **Rate Limiting**: An `express-rate-limit` middleware has been implemented for `/api` routes. This limits the number of requests per IP address within a specified window, configurable via environment variables (`RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`), defaulting to 100 requests every 15 minutes, to prevent abuse.
*   **Health Check Endpoint**: A new `/health` GET endpoint has been added. This endpoint provides basic application status information, including "OK" status, a timestamp, uptime, and the current environment, which is crucial for monitoring and deployment health checks.
*   **Security Middleware**: `helmet` is used with a `crossOriginResourcePolicy` set to `cross-origin`, allowing resources like images to be consumed across different origins.
*   **Logging and Error Handling**: Standard middleware for request logging (using `morgan` streamed to a custom `logger`) and comprehensive error handling (`notFoundHandler`, `errorHandler`) are in place.
*   **Static File Serving**: The application is configured to serve static files from an `/uploads` directory under the `/uploads` route.
*   **API Documentation**: Integration with Swagger (`setupSwagger(app)`) is present for API documentation generation.

A recurring pattern observed in this configuration is the heavy reliance on environment variables (e.g., `process.env.FRONTEND_URL`, `process.env.RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `process.env.NODE_ENV`) for various settings, promoting flexibility and ease of deployment across different environments. The inclusion of `manmitr.com` related URLs alongside `kidmantree-backend` in the CORS origins suggests potential inter-project communication or a shared infrastructure/related projects.

## 9:59:00 AM
The `app.js` file underwent significant updates on 11/22/2025, 4:09:13 PM, primarily focusing on security, performance, and application setup:

*   **CORS Configuration Refinement**: The `cors` middleware was updated to use a dynamic `origin` function, checking against an `allowedOrigins` array. This array now includes a broader set of domains, such as `localhost` variants (3000, 5173, 8000), specific production domains like `app.manmitr.com`, `http://manmitr.com`, `https://api.manmitr.com`, and render deployment URLs (`https://kidmantree-backend-g2la.onrender.com`, `https://manmitr.onrender.com`), indicating support for diverse development and deployment environments.
*   **Rate Limiting Implementation**: `express-rate-limit` was introduced and applied to all `/api` routes. The rate limit window and maximum requests are configurable via environment variables (`RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`), defaulting to 15 minutes and 100 requests respectively.
*   **Security Enhancements**: `helmet` middleware was configured to set various HTTP headers for security, specifically allowing cross-origin resource policy for `cross-origin`.
*   **Performance & Body Parsing**: `compression` middleware was added for GZIP compression, and `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` were configured with a `10mb` limit for request body parsing.
*   **Centralized Logging**: `morgan` was integrated for request logging, using the `combined` format and streaming output to a custom `logger.info` function, ensuring consistent logging practices.
*   **Static File Serving**: An endpoint `/uploads` was created to serve static files from the `uploads` directory.
*   **API Structure & Documentation**: All API routes are now mounted under `/api` using a `routes` module, and Swagger documentation setup (`setupSwagger`) is integrated.
*   **Health Check Endpoint**: A new `/health` GET endpoint was added, providing basic application status, timestamp, uptime, and environment information for monitoring purposes.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Dedicated `notFoundHandler` and `errorHandler` middlewares are applied at the end of the middleware chain for comprehensive error management.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements**:
A strong pattern of using environment variables for configuration (e.g., `FRONTEND_URL`, `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `NODE_ENV`) is evident, promoting flexibility and easy adaptation across different deployment environments. There is also a consistent focus on security (Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting) and operational best practices (logging, health checks, structured error handling).

## 10:16:46 AM
The code changes log details updates across several frontend files, primarily focusing on report generation and styling, all occurring within a concentrated period on November 24, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **9:17:06 AM:** The `Report` component initially rendered only `ShareOfVoiceReport`, with commented-out code indicating it previously included `MediaScore` and `Sentiment`.
    *   **9:18:24 AM:** A significant feature addition introduced PDF download functionality. This involved importing `useRef`, `html2canvas`, and `jspdf`, implementing an asynchronous `downloadPDF` function, and adding a button to trigger it. The `ShareOfVoiceReport` component was targeted for PDF export.
    *   **9:20:45 AM:** The `"use client";` directive was added to designate the component for client-side rendering.
    *   **9:28:14 AM - 9:32:01 AM:** A brief change and reversion occurred, where a `pdf-export` class was added to the exportable `div` and then removed.
    *   **9:46:37 AM:** The PDF generation functionality and related imports were completely removed. The `Report` component was reverted to its earlier structure, now importing and rendering `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport` directly. The `"use client";` directive was also removed.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\app\globals.css`**
    *   **9:27:22 AM - 9:27:39 AM:** This file contains extensive global CSS definitions. Key elements include Tailwind CSS imports, `Poppins` font family for `html`, `body`, Quill editor, and ApexCharts, responsive table styles, a CSS animation for `slide`, custom scrollbar styles, and specific styling for various UI components (swiper, dialogs, multiselect, TinyMCE editor, tooltips). A large section of background image styles for "HOME PAGE1" and "DATABASE PAGE" were present but commented out. There were no functional changes between the two timestamps for this file, suggesting a re-save or minor, non-functional edit.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **10:08:05 AM:** This component was introduced or significantly updated. It's a client-side component (`"use client";`) that dynamically imports `react-apexcharts`. It displays a detailed sentiment report, including performance metrics, comparative analysis with bar charts, and narrative summaries for both the company and its competitors. The component's structure and use of `pdf-section` and `min-h-[841px]` suggest it's designed to be part of a printable PDF report.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **10:08:42 AM - 10:08:59 AM:** Similar to `Sentiment.jsx`, this component was introduced or significantly updated. It is also a client-side component (`"use client";`) that dynamically imports `react-apexcharts`. It provides a comprehensive Share of Voice report featuring a bar chart for monthly share, pie charts for share by mentions, reach, and average share, along with tables detailing top journalists for the brand and its competitors. The component's styling (e.g., `pdf-section`, `min-h-[841px]`) indicates it's also prepared for PDF export. No functional changes were observed between the two timestamps.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Focused Development Session:** All changes occurred on November 24, 2025, primarily between 9:17 AM and 10:09 AM, indicating a concentrated effort on report features.
*   **Report Generation and Display:** A major theme is the development and structuring of analytical reports (`SentimentReport`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`).
*   **PDF Export Intent:** Although PDF export logic was added and then removed from the main `Report.jsx` component, the individual report components (`Sentiment.jsx`, `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`) are clearly designed for PDF output (e.g., `pdf-section` class, fixed heights). This suggests a shift in where the PDF generation logic is handled or a temporary rollback.
*   **Client-Side Rendering (Next.js):** The consistent use of `"use client";` (at least temporarily in `Report.jsx` and persistently in `Sentiment.jsx` and `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`) indicates these are client components within a Next.js application.
*   **Dynamic Imports for Charting:** Both `Sentiment.jsx` and `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx` utilize `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` for `react-apexcharts`, ensuring that charting libraries are loaded client-side and not during server-side rendering.
*   **Static Data for Reports:** The report components rely on extensive static data objects (e.g., `performanceMetrics`, `shareOfVoiceData`) within their code, likely for demonstration or initial development before integration with an actual data source.

## 11:17:09 AM
The development log primarily details changes across three React components related to brand reporting: `Report.jsx`, `Sentiment.jsx`, `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`, and `MediaScore.jsx`, along with updates to the global stylesheet `globals.css`.

    *   **Initial State (11/24/2025, 9:17 AM):** The component began as a simple wrapper rendering only `ShareOfVoiceReport`, with `MediaScore` and `Sentiment` commented out.
    *   **Early PDF Integration (11/24/2025, 9:18 AM):** Introduced `html2canvas` and `jsPDF` for a basic PDF download feature, capturing a single component (`ShareOfVoiceReport`) and adding a "Download PDF" button.
    *   **Refactored Multi-page PDF Export (11/24/2025, 10:18 AM):** The PDF generation logic was significantly refactored into external helper functions (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`, `downloadPDFWithLinks`). This new logic enables capturing multiple sections (identified by the `.pdf-section` class on child components) into a single, multi-page PDF named "Brand-Report.pdf", and includes functionality to preserve clickable links. The `Report` component now renders `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport` together.
    *   **`html2canvas-pro` Adoption (11/24/2025, 10:38 AM):** The HTML-to-canvas library was updated from `html2canvas` to `html2canvas-pro`, likely for performance or feature enhancements.
    *   **Frequent Styling and Debugging (11/24/2025, 10:28 AM - 11:00 AM):** This period shows numerous small changes related to styling, layout (e.g., `mx-auto`, `p-10`, `flex` classes), and debugging the PDF generation. This included commenting and uncommenting CSS rules (`pdf-style-fix`, `pdf-color-fix`) intended to fix rendering issues within the PDF, and various adjustments to the wrapper `div`'s class names. The download button itself was temporarily commented out at one point before being restored.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/24/2025, 10:08 AM):** This component was introduced to display sentiment data, including performance metrics and comparative analysis, visualized with ApexCharts. Its main `section` element was marked with `className="pdf-section w-1/2 min-h-[841px] bg-[#f5f5f5] p-6"`, making it targetable for the multi-page PDF export.
    *   **Content and Layout Adjustments (11/24/2025, 10:50 AM - 10:51 AM):** The "Company Narratives" and "Competitor Narratives" sections, along with their dummy data, were commented out. Minor layout adjustments were made to margins and the `min-h-[841px]` property of the main section, though the latter was quickly reverted.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/24/2025, 10:08 AM):** This component was added to display share of voice data, including monthly trends, mentions, reach, and top journalists, using various ApexCharts. Its primary `section` element also used `className="pdf-section w-1/2 min-h-[841px] bg-[#f5f5f5] p-6"`, making it part of the multi-page PDF.
    *   **Layout Adjustments (11/24/2025, 10:51 AM - 10:52 AM):** The `min-h-[841px]` property on the main section was briefly removed and then re-added, likely for testing rendering behavior.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/24/2025, 10:43 AM):** This component was introduced to visualize media impact scores, competitor rankings, and quality of mentions using ApexCharts. Its main `section` element included `className="pdf-section flex justify-between flex-col w-1/2 min-h-[841px] bg-[#f5f5f5] p-6"`, enabling its inclusion in the generated PDF.
    *   **Layout Adjustments (11/24/2025, 10:45 AM - 10:46 AM):** The `w-1/2` width on the main `pdf-section` was temporarily changed to a fixed `w-[595px]` before being reverted.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\app\globals.css`**: (No functional changes were recorded for this file between the two timestamps 11/24/2025, 9:27 AM). This file defines global styles, integrating Tailwind CSS, responsive designs, custom scrollbar styles, Quill editor adjustments, ApexCharts font settings, and includes many commented-out legacy background image styles.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/24/2025, 9:18 AM:** First introduction of PDF generation in `Report.jsx`.

## 12:17:12 PM
The log details a series of changes focused on developing and refining reporting components within a React/Next.js frontend application, particularly around PDF generation and data visualization.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup (11/24/2025, 9:17:06 AM):** Started as a basic component rendering only `ShareOfVoiceReport`, with `MediaScore` and `Sentiment` commented out.
    *   **PDF Export Integration (11/24/2025, 9:18:24 AM - 9:32:01 AM):** Quickly introduced basic PDF download functionality using `useRef`, `html2canvas`, and `jsPDF` to export the `ShareOfVoiceReport` component. The `"use client";` directive was added.
    *   **Component Reversion & Advanced PDF (11/24/2025, 9:46:37 AM - 10:20:20 AM):** The component temporarily reverted to only rendering `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport`. Soon after, a more sophisticated multi-page PDF export system was implemented. This new system uses `querySelectorAll(".pdf-section")` to capture multiple report components, converts each to an image, and adds them as separate pages to a `jsPDF` document, including an attempt to preserve clickable links. Helper functions (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) were introduced for PDF rendering specific CSS.
    *   **PDF Styling & Library Update (11/24/2025, 10:28:07 AM - 10:38:49 AM):** There was experimentation with the `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` functions, commenting them out, adding new styles, and then reinstating the original ones. Crucially, the PDF rendering library was updated from `html2canvas` to `html2canvas-pro`.
    *   **Layout and Integration (11/24/2025, 10:40:45 AM - 11:00:07 AM):** Throughout this period, various Tailwind CSS classes were added to control layout, centering, and padding of the report components and download button. There were temporary removals and re-introductions of the PDF download button, and structural changes like wrapping the report components in a `div` with `mx-auto font-inter`.
    *   **Spokesperson Report Integration (11/24/2025, 11:29:09 AM):** The newly created `SpokePersonReport` component was imported and added to the list of components rendered within the main report section, indicating its inclusion in the overall brand report and PDF export.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\app\globals.css`**
    *   **Extensive Styling Additions (11/24/2025, 9:27:22 AM):** A large block of global CSS was added. This included Tailwind CSS configuration, global font definitions (`Poppins`), smooth scroll behavior, custom Swiper pagination, responsive table styles, a sliding animation, scrollbar hiding, specific container widths, Quill Editor styles, ApexCharts font overrides, custom scrollbar designs, dialog backdrop styles, multiselect component styling, and a wide array of utility classes for icons, shimmer tables, and various layout fixes. Many commented-out sections suggest planned or previous image-based background styles for home and database pages.
    *   **No Functional Changes (11/24/2025, 9:27:39 AM):** This entry shows no effective code change, likely an autosave or minor whitespace adjustment.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/24/2025, 10:08:05 AM):** Created as a client-side component to display sentiment data. It includes performance metrics, comparative analysis, and sections for company and competitor narratives. It utilizes `react-apexcharts` for bar charts and has a `pdf-section` class for PDF export.
    *   **Narrative Sections Commented Out (11/24/2025, 10:50:28 AM):** The sections for "Company Narratives" and "Competitor Narratives" were commented out, simplifying the report content. Minor styling adjustments to margins also occurred.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/24/2025, 10:08:42 AM):** Introduced as a client-side component to visualize Share of Voice metrics. It uses `react-apexcharts` to display monthly share of voice (bar chart), share by mentions (pie chart), share by reach (pie chart), and average share of voice (pie chart). It also includes tables for top journalists for both the brand and its competitors. It carries the `pdf-section` class.
    *   **Minor Layout Adjustments (11/24/2025, 10:51:46 AM - 10:52:20 AM):** Brief changes were made to the main `section` element's `min-h` property, which was then reverted.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11/24/2025, 10:43:20 AM):** Developed as a client-side component to display media impact scores. It features a media impact score summary, a competitor ranking table, a pie chart for quality of mentions, a line chart for media impact score trends, and a stacked bar chart for media mention count by type. Like other reports, it uses `react-apexcharts` and has the `pdf-section` class.
    *   **Layout Adjustments (11/24/2025, 10:45:31 AM - 10:46:09 AM):** A temporary change set the main `section` width to a fixed `w-[595px]`, which was then reverted to `w-1/2`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Skeleton (11/24/2025, 11:21:02 AM):** Created as a placeholder component.
    *   **Full Implementation with API (11/24/2025, 11:28:53 AM):** Rapidly implemented with dynamic data fetching from several API endpoints (`SPOKESPERSON_MENTIONS`, `SPOKESPERSON_SENTIMENT_CHART`, `spokesperson-monthly-chart`, `SPOKESPERSON_NO_OF_MENTIONS`). It includes charts for mention count and sentiment, a speedometer for mention changes, and a table for top spokespersons. Also designated with `pdf-section`. A minor syntax error in an image `src` attribute was corrected.
    *   **Transition to Dummy Data & Styling (11/24/2025, 11:32:21 AM - 11:37:04 AM):** The component was refactored to use static dummy data instead of API calls, removing several related imports. Its layout and chart configurations were then refined, including adjusting chart types (e.g., horizontal bar chart for monthly mentions) and extensive Tailwind CSS styling to align with the visual presentation of other report components.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/24/2025, 9:18:24 AM:** First PDF export functionality introduced in `Report.jsx`.
*   **11/24/2025, 10:08:05 AM - 10:43:20 AM:** Implementation of core report components: `Sentiment.jsx`, `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`, and `MediaScore.jsx`.
*   **11/24/2025, 10:18:41 AM:** Major refactor of `Report.jsx` to support multi-page PDF generation from `pdf-section` elements.
*   **11/24/2025, 10:38:49 AM:** Upgrade to `html2canvas-pro` for PDF rendering in `Report.jsx`.
*   **11/24/2025, 10:50:28 AM:** Simplification of `Sentiment.jsx` by commenting out narrative sections.
*   **11/24/2025, 11:28:53 AM:** Full development of `SpokePersonReport.jsx` with API integration.
*   **11/24/2025, 11:29:09 AM:** Integration of `SpokePersonReport` into the main `Report.jsx`.
*   **11/24/2025, 11:32:21 AM:** `SpokePersonReport.jsx` shifts from API to dummy data.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **PDF Report Generation:** A dominant pattern is the continuous development and refinement of a PDF export feature across all report components. This involves using `html2canvas(-pro)` and `jsPDF`, targeting elements with the `pdf-section` class, and managing styling for optimal PDF output.
*   **Client-Side Components:** All new React components explicitly use `"use client";`, indicating a Next.js environment where these components are rendered on the client side.
*   **Data Visualization with ApexCharts:** `react-apexcharts` is extensively used across `Sentiment.jsx`, `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`, `MediaScore.jsx`, and `SpokePersonReport.jsx` for displaying various types of data through bar, pie, line, and speedometer charts. The library is dynamically imported.
*   **Dummy Data for Development:** Components frequently use dummy data, either in their initial implementation or as a temporary switch from API-driven data, suggesting a modular development approach or a focus on UI/UX independent of live data.
*   **Consistent Styling with Tailwind CSS:** All report components and the global CSS leverage Tailwind CSS for a unified and responsive design, with specific `font-inter` and color schemes. There are recurring patterns for section containers (`bg-white rounded-xl p-4 border border-[#00000033] mb-4`) and chart/table styling.
*   **Modular Report Structure:** The overall brand report (`Report.jsx`) is composed of multiple sub-reports (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `SpokePersonReport`), each designed as an independent visual section within the comprehensive report.

## 1:17:22 PM
The changes log details a series of iterative updates to report generation components, primarily focusing on PDF export functionality and the integration of various brand-related reports. A recurring pattern involves the development and refinement of PDF generation, including attempts to apply specific styling, and then often commenting out or adjusting those styling applications. There's also a consistent effort to structure report components as `pdf-section` elements, likely for modular PDF page generation. Most components use dummy data for demonstration.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`

This file undergoes the most frequent and significant changes, indicating it's the central orchestrator for the brand reports.

*   **Initial Setup (11/24/2025, 9:17:06 AM - 9:32:01 AM):** The `Report` component initially displayed only `ShareOfVoiceReport`. It quickly evolves to include client-side PDF export functionality using `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`, allowing a single `ShareOfVoiceReport` to be downloaded. Styling attempts for the export wrapper include `p-4` and briefly `pdf-export`.
*   **Refactor to Combined Reports (11/24/2025, 9:46:37 AM):** A significant change reverts the component to a simpler structure, removing all PDF logic, but activating and rendering `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport` together.
*   **Advanced PDF Integration (11/24/2025, 10:18:41 AM - 10:40:45 AM):** PDF export is re-implemented, now designed to capture multiple sections (`.pdf-section`) as separate pages in a single PDF, complete with attempts to preserve clickable links. Helper functions `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` are introduced to fix rendering issues with `img` and `svg`. The `html2canvas` library is updated to `html2canvas-pro` (11/24/2025, 10:38:49 AM). A temporary change removes the `pdf-section` class (11/24/2025, 10:40:45 AM), breaking the multi-section export.
*   **Styling and Layout Adjustments (11/24/2025, 10:47:22 AM - 11:00:07 AM):** The `pdf-section` class is restored (11/24/2025, 10:47:22 AM). Further changes focus on layout and centering the report components within their container using Tailwind CSS classes (`mx-auto`, `p-10`, `flex items-center`, `font-inter`). The download button is briefly commented out and then restored.
*   **Component Expansion (11/24/2025, 11:29:09 AM - 12:34:48 PM):** The `Report` component is expanded to include a new `SpokePersonReport` (11/24/2025, 11:29:09 AM) and subsequently a `CatelogReport` (11/24/2025, 12:34:48 PM), making it a comprehensive brand report viewer.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\app\globals.css`

*   **Extensive Styling Definitions (11/24/2025, 9:27:22 AM):** This file receives a large update, establishing global styles for the application. It integrates Tailwind CSS, sets the default font to "Poppins", and defines a wide range of custom styles. These include responsive table adjustments, scrollbar styling, Quill editor overrides, ApexCharts typography, dialog backdrops, and multi-select component styles. Numerous commented-out sections suggest past or future plans for homepage and database-specific background imagery. Minor changes are observed at 11/24/2025, 9:27:39 AM, likely saving the same content.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`

*   **Initial Development (11/24/2025, 10:08:05 AM):** This component is introduced as `SentimentReport`, designed to display sentiment analysis. It uses `next/dynamic` for client-side chart rendering and features dummy data for performance metrics, comparative analysis, and narratives (company and competitor). It uses ApexCharts for visualization and is marked with `pdf-section` for export.
*   **Narrative Content Removal (11/24/2025, 10:50:28 AM):** The sections displaying company and competitor narratives are commented out, simplifying the report's content.
*   **Layout Adjustments (11/24/2025, 10:50:53 AM - 10:51:35 AM):** Minor styling adjustments are made, including changes to vertical margins and the `min-h-[841px]` property on the main `section` element.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`

*   **Initial Development (11/24/2025, 10:08:42 AM):** The `ShareOfVoiceReport` component is introduced, displaying various Share of Voice metrics. It uses `next/dynamic` for client-side chart rendering with ApexCharts and includes dummy data for monthly share, mentions, reach, and top journalists. It is also marked with `pdf-section` for export. Minor changes are observed at 11/24/2025, 10:08:59 AM, likely saving the same content.
*   **Layout Adjustments (11/24/2025, 10:51:46 AM - 10:52:20 AM):** The `min-h-[841px]` property is temporarily removed and then re-added to the main `section` element.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`

*   **Initial Development (11/24/2025, 10:43:20 AM):** The `MediaScoreReport` component is introduced, displaying media impact scores, competitor rankings, and quality of mentions. It uses `next/dynamic` for ApexCharts and includes dummy data for these metrics. It is also marked with `pdf-section` for export. Minor changes are observed at 11/24/2025, 10:45:19 AM.
*   **Width and Layout Adjustments (11/24/2025, 10:45:31 AM - 10:52:45 AM):** The width of the main section is adjusted from `w-1/2` to `w-[595px]` and then reverted back to `w-1/2`. The `min-h-[841px]` property is temporarily removed and then re-added.

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`

*   **Initial Skeleton (11/24/2025, 11:21:02 AM):** Starts as a basic placeholder component.
*   **Full Implementation with API Hooks (11/24/2025, 11:28:53 AM):** Rapidly expands to a functional component with API calls using `userService`, date range management, dynamic chart imports (ApexCharts, ReactSpeedometer), and UI rendering for spokesperson mention counts, sentiment scores, and top mentions. It includes dummy data initially. A minor fix for image `src` concatenation occurs at 11/24/2025, 11:29:44 AM.
*   **Switch to Dummy Data & Styling Refinements (11/24/2025, 11:32:21 AM - 12:29:31 PM):** All API integration is removed, and the component relies entirely on hardcoded dummy data for demonstration. Numerous styling and layout adjustments are made, including changes to chart heights, font sizes, and the overall container width (`w-1/2`). The "Spokesperson Mention Count" chart's orientation is toggled between vertical and horizontal bars (e.g., vertical at 12:23:00 PM, then horizontal at 12:26:28 PM). The component code is temporarily commented out and then restored (12:25:25 PM - 12:25:48 PM), and dummy data is reduced (12:27:04 PM).

### File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`

*   **Initial Skeleton (11/24/2025, 12:29:51 PM):** Starts as a basic placeholder component.
*   **Full Implementation with Dummy Data (11/24/2025, 12:34:23 PM):** Expands to a `CatelogReport` component that displays a list of dummy articles, including website, title, summary, URL, date, and sentiment. It features a reusable `ArticleCard` sub-component and placeholder sections for filters and pagination (which are disabled/removed). It uses `pdf-section` for export and Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Layout and Content Streamlining (11/24/2025, 12:35:21 PM - 12:39:16 PM):** The "Date Filters placeholder" section and pagination info are removed to simplify the component for export purposes. Minor styling adjustments for borders, shadows, and rounded corners (`rounded-md` to `rounded-xl`) are made to the articles container.

**Overall Patterns:**

*   **PDF Export Focus:** A dominant theme is the implementation and refinement of multi-page PDF export functionality using `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`, with components consistently marked with `pdf-section`. There's an iterative process of adding, commenting out, and re-enabling custom styles or PDF helper functions, suggesting a debugging or experimentation phase.
*   **Dynamic Imports:** All report components (`Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `MediaScore`, `SpokePersonReport`) utilize `next/dynamic` to dynamically import `react-apexcharts` and `react-d3-speedometer`, optimizing client-side loading.
*   **Dummy Data Reliance:** After initial API integration attempts, `SpokePersonReport` and `CatelogReport` revert to using extensive dummy data. `SentimentReport` and `ShareOfVoiceReport` are also primarily displaying dummy data in the provided logs. This suggests the API integration might still be in progress or reports are being designed with static data first.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes across all components for styling and layout is a strong recurring element.
*   **Consistent Report Structure:** Report components generally follow a similar layout: a header (often with `h1` and `h-[50px]`), followed by sections of data visualization (charts, tables) within `bg-white rounded-xl p-4 border border-[#00000033]` containers. Each report component targets a `w-1/2` width, implying they are designed to be displayed side-by-side or stacked in a flexible layout.

## 2:17:29 PM
The provided log details changes across several React components related to report generation and styling within a Next.js frontend, all occurring on 11/24/2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **9:17:06 AM**: Initially, the `Report` component renders only `ShareOfVoiceReport`, with `MediaScore` and `Sentiment` commented out.
    *   **9:18:24 AM - 9:32:01 AM**: Major change introduces PDF download functionality using `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`. It adds a "Download PDF" button and wraps `ShareOfVoiceReport` for export. A `"use client";` directive is added at 9:20:45 AM. The wrapper `div` briefly gains and loses a `pdf-export` class.
    *   **9:46:37 AM**: The component is significantly reverted to render `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport` directly, removing the PDF export logic and the `"use client";` directive.
    *   **10:18:41 AM - 10:29:43 AM**: PDF export is reintroduced with a more sophisticated, multi-page approach. It now captures multiple sections marked `.pdf-section` and attempts to include clickable links. Helper functions `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` are added for PDF rendering consistency. There's an attempt to force black/white colors for PDF export (10:28:24 AM) which is then reverted (10:29:43 AM). `html2canvas` is imported as `html2canvas-pro` at 10:38:49 AM.
    *   **10:31:57 AM - 10:40:45 AM**: The `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` calls are temporarily commented out and then re-enabled. Crucially, the `.pdf-section` class is removed from the wrapper `div` containing the report components (10:40:45 AM), breaking the multi-page PDF export as no sections would be found.
    *   **10:47:22 AM - 11:00:07 AM**: Multiple minor layout and styling adjustments are made to the wrapper `div`s, often involving `mx-auto`, `p-10`, `font-inter`, and flexbox utilities for centering. The PDF button is toggled between commented and uncommented states during this period. The `.pdf-section` class is never reapplied to the report components' container, indicating a persistent issue with the multi-page PDF generation.
    *   **11:29:09 AM**: `SpokePersonReport` is imported and added to the rendered components within the main (still non-`.pdf-section` wrapped) content area.
    *   **12:34:48 PM**: `CatelogReport` is imported and added to the rendered components.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\app\globals.css`**
    *   **9:27:22 AM**: A substantial update introduces a wide array of global CSS rules, including:
        *   Font-family (`Poppins`) for common elements and ApexCharts.
        *   Responsive table styles.
        *   Custom Swiper pagination.
        *   Scroll behavior and scrollbar hiding utilities.
        *   Specific styles for Quill Editor (`.ql-editor`).
        *   Animations (`@keyframes slide`).
        *   Styling for modal backdrops and custom multiselect components.
        *   Placeholder/shimmer loading styles (`.record`, `.dummy__`).
        *   Numerous icon size utility classes (e.g., `icon-16`, `icon-100`).
        *   Overrides for TinyMCE editor status bar elements.
        *   A linear gradient for `.header-bg`.
    *   **9:27:39 AM**: No functional change.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **10:08:05 AM**: Initial component setup, displaying "Sentiment Report" with dummy data for performance metrics, comparative analysis, and detailed company/competitor narratives. It dynamically imports `ReactApexChart` and is marked `"use client";`. The main section is styled with `pdf-section` and `w-1/2 min-h-[841px]`.
    *   **10:50:28 AM**: The `companyNarratives` and `competitorNarratives` sections are commented out, significantly reducing the visible content.
    *   **10:51:19 AM - 10:51:35 AM**: The `min-h-[841px]` style is temporarily removed and then re-added to the main section.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **10:08:42 AM**: Initial component setup, displaying "Share of Voice Report" with dummy data for monthly share of voice, mentions, reach, and top journalists. It uses `ReactApexChart` for various charts (bar, pie) and is marked `"use client";`. The main section is styled with `pdf-section` and `w-1/2 min-h-[841px]`. The provided log snippet ends abruptly within a table definition.
    *   **10:51:46 AM - 10:52:20 AM**: The `min-h-[841px]` style is temporarily removed and then re-added to the main section.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **10:43:20 AM**: Initial component setup, displaying "Media Score Report" with dummy data for impact score, competitor ranking, quality of mentions, and trends. It uses `ReactApexChart` for pie, line, and stacked bar charts and is marked `"use client";`. The main section is styled with `pdf-section` and `w-1/2 min-h-[841px]`.
    *   **10:45:31 AM**: The main section's width is temporarily changed from `w-1/2` to a fixed `w-[595px]` (likely for A4 PDF compatibility), then reverted to `w-1/2` at 10:46:09 AM.
    *   **10:52:00 AM - 10:52:45 AM**: The `min-h-[841px]` style is temporarily removed and then re-added to the main section.
    *   **1:33:48 PM**: The unused `misComponents` dummy data array is commented out.

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **11:21:02 AM**: Initial stub component.
    *   **11:28:53 AM**: Extensive development to fetch and display spokesperson data (mentions, sentiment) with charts (`ReactApexChart`, `ReactSpeedometer`) and tables. It uses `userService` for API calls, `useLocalStorage`, and `useNotification`.
    *   **11:29:44 AM**: Corrects an image source concatenation issue.
    *   **11:32:21 AM**: Major change to use entirely static "dummy data" instead of API calls. All API-related imports, state, and `useEffect` hooks are commented out or removed. The component's main tag is changed from `main` to `section`, with styling adjustments.
    *   **11:37:04 AM**: Significant refactoring of chart configurations and extensive styling adjustments to align with the `.pdf-section` and `w-1/2 min-h-[841px]` pattern seen in other report components. `monthlyChartData`'s bar chart changes from horizontal to vertical.
    *   **12:17:13 PM - 12:29:31 PM**: Dummy data variables are consistently prefixed with `dummy`. There are several minor changes related to chart configuration and data mapping, including a temporary bug with an undefined `graphData` and subsequent fixes. `monthlyChartData`'s bar chart orientation flips back to horizontal at 12:26:28 PM. The `dummyMentionGraphData` is shortened at 12:27:04 PM. The entire component is commented out at 12:25:25 PM then restored at 12:25:48 PM.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **12:29:51 PM**: Initial stub component.
    *   **12:34:23 PM**: Develops the "Catalog Report" with dummy article data, `ArticleCard` component for display, and placeholders for filters/pagination. The main section adopts the `pdf-section` and `w-1/2 min-h-[841px]` styling. It includes a shadow style for content.
    *   **12:35:21 PM - 12:35:32 PM**: Removes dummy date filter UI and one dummy article.
    *   **12:37:19 PM - 12:39:16 PM**: Styling adjustments are made (removing shadow, changes to `border-radius`, padding). The "Pagination info" placeholder is removed at 12:38:47 PM.
    *   **1:26:06 PM - 1:26:27 PM**: Further reduces the dummy articles to four and removes `min-h-[841px]` from the main section.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **PDF Export Focus:** A dominant theme is the continuous development and refinement of PDF export functionality across `Report.jsx` and the individual report components (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`). This includes using `html2canvas` (or `html2canvas-pro`) and `jsPDF`, iterating over `pdf-section` elements, and managing CSS for optimal rendering within the PDF. However, there's a recurring inconsistency in `Report.jsx` where the main container for the individual report components often lacks the `.pdf-section` class, which would prevent the multi-page export logic from finding them.
*   **`"use client";` Directive:** Frequently added/removed in components, indicating client-side rendering for Next.js.
*   **Dynamic Imports for Charts:** `next/dynamic` is consistently used with `ssr: false` for `react-apexcharts` and `react-d3-speedometer` across report components to ensure these chart libraries are loaded client-side.
*   **Dummy Data:** Most report components (`Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `MediaScore`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`) are built using hardcoded "dummy data" instead of live API fetches, suggesting a development or mock-up phase. `SpokePersonReport.jsx` even explicitly reverts from API calls to dummy data.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Extensive use of Tailwind CSS utility classes is evident across all components for styling, and `globals.css` reflects strong Tailwind integration.
*   **Consistent Report Section Styling:** Individual report components (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`) adopt a similar layout pattern with a main `section` element, often using `className="pdf-section flex flex-col w-1/2 min-h-[841px] bg-[#f5f5f5] p-6"`, clearly designed for consistent A4-like page rendering in PDF exports. The `min-h-[841px]` and `w-1/2` (or `w-[595px]`) styles aim for A4 portrait dimensions.
*   **Iterative Development & Debugging:** Frequent commenting out/uncommenting of code blocks, especially in `Report.jsx` and `SpokePersonReport.jsx`, indicates active development, testing, and debugging of features and styling.

## 3:17:21 PM
The development log details a concentrated effort on `11/24/2025` to build and refine brand report components and their PDF export functionality.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Early Changes (9:17 AM - 9:32 AM):** The `Report` component initially focused on rendering `ShareOfVoiceReport`. A significant update introduced client-side PDF generation capabilities using `html2canvas` and `jspdf`, including a "Download PDF" button and a `useRef` hook to target the content for export. The `"use client"` directive was added, and class names (`pdf-export`) were added and removed from the target div, indicating active iteration on PDF targeting.
    *   **Mid-Morning Shift (9:46 AM):** The PDF export logic was temporarily removed, and the component reverted to simply rendering `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport` directly.
    *   **Re-implementation and Refinements (10:18 AM - 10:40 AM):** The PDF generation feature was thoroughly re-implemented. The new `downloadPDFWithLinks` function was designed to capture multiple sections (`.pdf-section`) as separate pages in a PDF, handling image data scaling and clickable links. Helper functions `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` were introduced to manage CSS during PDF rendering (e.g., ensuring `img`, `svg` display correctly). There were several small changes around commenting/uncommenting these style functions and experimenting with `html2canvas` vs `html2canvas-pro`, suggesting debugging PDF rendering issues.
    *   **Layout and Integration (10:40 AM - 12:34 PM):** The `Report` component's layout was adjusted with various Tailwind CSS classes (`mx-auto`, `p-10`, `flex`, `items-center`, `font-inter`). Key changes include toggling the presence of the "Download Report" button and the addition of `SpokePersonReport` (at 11:29:09 AM) and `CatelogReport` (at 12:34:48 PM) as new sub-components within the main report structure. A `pdfRef` was also briefly reintroduced and then removed, indicating a preference for `querySelectorAll(".pdf-section")` for multi-page PDF generation.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\app\globals.css`**
    *   **Single Major Update (9:27 AM):** A comprehensive set of global CSS rules was added. This included Tailwind CSS configuration, setting "Poppins" as the global font, custom Swiper pagination styles, responsive table adaptations for mobile, a slide animation, scrollbar utilities, Quill editor specific overrides, ApexCharts font styling, custom scrollbar designs, dialog backdrop opacity, multiselect component styling, and a variety of icon size definitions. Several large blocks of CSS were commented out for "HOME PAGE1" and "DATABASE PAGE," indicating potentially inactive or legacy styles.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup (10:08 AM):** This component was created to display sentiment analysis, including performance metrics, comparative data (with bar charts), and narrative summaries. It uses dummy data and `react-apexcharts`. The main section was marked with `pdf-section` and set to `w-1/2 min-h-[841px]`.
    *   **Narrative Removal and Styling (10:50 AM - 10:51 AM):** The `companyNarratives` and `competitorNarratives` sections were commented out, simplifying the report. Minor styling adjustments were made to margins and the `min-h-[841px]` property, which was briefly removed and then reinstated.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup (10:08 AM):** This component was created to show share of voice data, including a monthly bar chart, pie charts for mentions, reach, and average share of voice, and tables for top journalists. It uses dummy data and `react-apexcharts`. Like `Sentiment.jsx`, its main section was marked `pdf-section w-1/2 min-h-[841px]`.
    *   **Styling Consistency (10:51 AM - 10:52 AM):** The `min-h-[841px]` property was briefly removed and then reinstated, mirroring the change in `Sentiment.jsx`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup (10:43 AM):** This component was introduced to display media impact scores, competitor rankings, and quality of mentions (using pie, line, and stacked bar charts). It utilizes dummy data and `react-apexcharts`, with increased chart heights. The main section was also marked `pdf-section w-1/2 min-h-[841px]`.
    *   **Styling and Data Adjustments (10:45 AM - 1:33 PM):** Brief experimentation with a fixed width (`w-[595px]`) for the main section, which was later reverted to `w-1/2`. The `min-h-[841px]` property was also toggled. The `misComponents` dummy data array was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **Placeholder to Full Implementation (11:21 AM - 11:28 AM):** Started as a placeholder and quickly became a fully implemented component displaying spokesperson mention count (chart), number of mentions (speedometer), sentiment score (chart), and top 5 spokespersons (table).
    *   **Data Source Transition and Refinements (11:29 AM - 12:29 PM):** Initially designed to fetch data from API endpoints, it transitioned to using dummy data. Several small changes involved adjusting chart configurations (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical bars for monthly mentions, specific colors), layout (padding, widths), and commenting out sections during debugging. The `min-h-[841px]` property was added to its main `section` element, aligning with other report components, and dummy data for `mentionGraphData` was shortened.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **Placeholder to Full Implementation (12:29 PM - 12:34 PM):** Began as a placeholder and quickly evolved into a component displaying a "Catalog Report" with a list of articles, including website, title, summary, link, date, and sentiment. It uses dummy data.
    *   **Content and Styling Tweaks (12:35 PM - 1:26 PM):** The date filters placeholder was removed. Minor styling adjustments were made to border radii, shadows, and padding. The pagination information was explicitly marked as "disabled for export". One article was removed from the `dummyArticles` list. The `min-h-[841px]` property was toggled, similar to other report components.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **PDF Export Focus:** The most prominent pattern is the continuous development and debugging of a multi-page PDF export feature using `html2canvas(-pro)` and `jspdf`. This involved creating `".pdf-section"` class markers, helper functions for styling, and dynamic dimension calculations.
*   **Component-Based Reporting:** The application structure heavily relies on separate, specialized React components (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`) for different aspects of brand reporting, all integrated into a central `Report.jsx` container.
*   **Dummy Data Utilization:** All individual report components (`Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `MediaScore`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`) were developed using extensive dummy data. This suggests a front-end first approach, focusing on UI/UX and charting without live API integration during this phase.
*   **Charting Libraries:** `react-apexcharts` is consistently used across almost all report components for data visualization (bar, pie, line charts). `react-d3-speedometer` is used in `SpokePersonReport`.
*   **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is universally applied for styling across all components, indicated by classes like `bg-white`, `rounded-xl`, `p-4`, `flex`, `grid`, `w-1/2`, and `font-inter`. Consistent use of `min-h-[841px]` on `pdf-section` elements suggests a target PDF page height.
*   **"use client" Directive:** All new/modified React components (`.jsx` files) include `"use client"` at the top, indicating they are client-side components within a Next.js framework.
*   **Timeliness:** All recorded changes occurred on the same day, `11/24/2025`, implying a concentrated period of development and integration work.

## 4:17:21 PM
The code change log details a focused development effort on building a comprehensive brand report generation feature within a React/Next.js frontend. The core work spans several report components and a central report aggregator, with a strong emphasis on PDF export functionality and consistent styling.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**: This file underwent the most significant and iterative changes.
    *   **Early Changes (9:17 AM - 9:32 AM)**: Initially started with only `ShareOfVoiceReport` active, then rapidly introduced and refined a single-page PDF download feature using `html2canvas` and `jsPDF`, including a `useRef` for the target element. A `pdf-export` class was briefly added and removed.
    *   **Major Refactor (9:46 AM - 10:40 AM)**: The PDF export was removed, then fully reintroduced to support multi-page PDF generation from multiple report sections (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`). This involved helper functions (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) for dynamic CSS injection to fix rendering issues in PDFs, and logic to add clickable links. The `html2canvas` library was switched to `html2canvas-pro`. Multiple minor adjustments were made to the PDF export logic and CSS application.
    *   **Layout & Component Integration (10:40 AM - 12:34 PM)**: The layout of the main report container was frequently adjusted using Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `mx-auto p-10`, `flex items-center justify-center`). Crucially, `SpokePersonReport` (11:29:09 AM) and `CatelogReport` (12:34:48 PM) components were progressively imported and added to the report rendering, indicating the expansion of the report's scope.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\app\globals.css`**: This file received a substantial update (9:27:22 AM - 9:27:39 AM) with numerous new CSS classes. These include:
    *   Tailwind CSS imports and configuration.
    *   Responsive table styles.
    *   Custom scrollbar designs (`.no-scrollbar`, `.scroll`, `.side-bar-scroll`).
    *   Styling for Quill Editor (`.ql-container`, `.ql-editor`).
    *   Specific font family (`Poppins`) and color overrides for ApexCharts elements.
    *   Styling for multiselect dropdowns.
    *   Various icon size utilities (e.g., `.icon-10`, `.icon-100`).
    *   Shimmer table placeholder styles.
    *   CSS to hide TinyMCE editor elements.
    *   Loading animations, header gradients, and tooltip styles.
    *   A large block of commented-out CSS related to background images for "HOME PAGE1" and "DATABASE PAGE", suggesting older or alternative layout designs.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial Setup (10:08:05 AM)**: Implemented the `SentimentReport` with dummy data for performance metrics, comparative analysis, company narratives, and competitor narratives. It used `ReactApexChart` for visualizations.
    *   **Simplification (10:50 AM - 10:51 AM)**: The detailed `companyNarratives` and `competitorNarratives` sections were commented out, reducing the component's complexity. Minor layout adjustments (`mb-4` to `mb-2`).
    *   **Layout Consistency**: Main `section` elements consistently used `pdf-section` and `w-1/2 min-h-[841px]` (with a brief removal and re-addition of `min-h`).
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial Setup (10:08:42 AM - 10:08:59 AM)**: Introduced the `ShareOfVoiceReport` component with dummy data covering share of voice trends (bar chart), mentions (pie chart), reach (pie chart), average share of voice (pie chart), and top journalists (tables).
    *   **Layout Consistency (10:51 AM - 10:52 AM)**: Similar to `Sentiment.jsx`, `min-h-[841px]` was briefly removed and then restored on the main `section` element, ensuring consistent PDF page sizing.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**:
    *   **Placeholder to Full Implementation (11:21:02 AM - 11:28:53 AM)**: Evolved from a simple placeholder to a complex report using `dynamic` imports for charts and speedometer, integrating API calls (later reverted) for spokesperson mentions, sentiment, and trend data.
    *   **Dummy Data & Refactoring (11:32 AM - 12:29 PM)**: The API data fetching logic was replaced with hardcoded dummy data for demonstration purposes, and subsequent changes focused on refining chart configurations (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical bars), speedometer display, and Tailwind CSS styling. There were several temporary broken states or inconsistencies in chart configuration (`graphData` reference) which were later resolved. The component was briefly commented out and then restored.
    *   **Data Structure**: `dummyMentionGraphData` was shortened (12:27:04 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial Setup (10:43:20 AM)**: Implemented `MediaScoreReport` with dummy data for media impact score, competitor ranking (table), quality of mentions (pie chart), media impact trend (line chart), and media mention count (stacked bar chart).
    *   **Layout Adjustments (10:45 AM - 10:46 AM)**: A temporary change from `w-1/2` to `w-[595px]` (fixed pixel width, likely for A4 PDF page size) was made and then reverted.
    *   **Cleanup (1:33:48 PM)**: Removed unused `misComponents` dummy data.
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**:
    *   **Placeholder to Full Implementation (12:29:51 PM - 12:34:23 PM)**: Transitioned from a basic placeholder to a component displaying a list of dummy articles with sentiment and links.
    *   **UI Refinements (12:35 PM - 12:39 PM)**: Removed dummy date filters, adjusted pagination display (removed, then re-added with "disabled for export" note), and made minor styling changes to the article container (`shadow`, `rounded-md`/`rounded-xl`).
    *   **Data Structure (1:26:06 PM)**: Shortened the `dummyArticles` array.
    *   **Layout Consistency**: `min-h-[841px]` was briefly removed (1:26:27 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\GenerateReport\GenerateReport.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial Implementation (4:10:07 PM - 4:10:34 PM)**: This component acts as a control center for report generation. It uses local storage for brand data and status, defines various period options, and manages state for multiple report sections (Media Score, Sentiment, Share of Voice, Spokesperson, Catalog). It includes checkboxes and dropdowns for users to select which components and timeframes to include in a custom report. A "Select All" button is provided. It conditionally renders a message if `brandStatus` is false.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **PDF Export Functionality**: A central theme is the development and refinement of PDF export, iterating from simple single-page to complex multi-page reports with dynamic styling and clickable links, indicating a crucial user requirement.
*   **Dummy Data for Development**: Many report components (`Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `MediaScore`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`) heavily rely on hardcoded "dummy data" during their initial implementation. This suggests a component-first development approach where UI and PDF rendering were prioritized before full API integration. `SpokePersonReport` explicitly reverted from API calls to dummy data.
*   **Client-Side React Components**: All `.jsx` files begin with `"use client";`, confirming they are client-side components within a Next.js application, likely due to their reliance on browser-specific APIs (e.g., `document` for PDF generation) and interactive charting libraries.
*   **Data Visualization with ApexCharts & ReactSpeedometer**: The use of `react-apexcharts` is ubiquitous across report components for various chart types (bar, pie, line). `react-d3-speedometer` is specifically used in `SpokePersonReport`.
*   **Tailwind CSS for Styling**: A consistent pattern of using Tailwind CSS utility classes is evident across all components for layout, spacing, colors, borders, and typography, ensuring a unified visual design.
*   **Modular Report Structure**: The main `Report.jsx` acts as an orchestrator, importing and rendering individual report sections (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`). Each of these sections is designed as a standalone "page" for PDF export, marked with `pdf-section` and often `min-h-[841px]` (A4 portrait dimensions).
*   **Iterative Development**: The detailed log entries for `Report.jsx` and `SpokePersonReport.jsx` demonstrate an iterative development process, with features being introduced, refined, commented out, and re-enabled, often with small, rapid changes to styling and logic.
