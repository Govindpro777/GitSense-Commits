# Activity Summary for 11/24/2025

## 8:59:04 AM
The `app.js` file, updated on 11/22/2025 at 4:09:13 PM, outlines the core configuration for an Express.js application. Key updates include:

*   **Enhanced CORS Configuration**: A significant change involves a more restrictive and explicit Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) setup. Instead of a general allowance, a specific `allowedOrigins` array is defined. This array includes local development URLs (`http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:8000`), production domains (`https://app.manmitr.com`, `http://manmitr.com`, `https://api.manmitr.com`), and deployment URLs on Render (`https://kidmantree-backend-g2la.onrender.com`, `https://manmitr.onrender.com`). The application now checks incoming requests against this whitelist, providing tighter security control.
*   **Rate Limiting**: An `express-rate-limit` middleware has been implemented for `/api` routes. This limits the number of requests per IP address within a specified window, configurable via environment variables (`RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`), defaulting to 100 requests every 15 minutes, to prevent abuse.
*   **Health Check Endpoint**: A new `/health` GET endpoint has been added. This endpoint provides basic application status information, including "OK" status, a timestamp, uptime, and the current environment, which is crucial for monitoring and deployment health checks.
*   **Security Middleware**: `helmet` is used with a `crossOriginResourcePolicy` set to `cross-origin`, allowing resources like images to be consumed across different origins.
*   **Logging and Error Handling**: Standard middleware for request logging (using `morgan` streamed to a custom `logger`) and comprehensive error handling (`notFoundHandler`, `errorHandler`) are in place.
*   **Static File Serving**: The application is configured to serve static files from an `/uploads` directory under the `/uploads` route.
*   **API Documentation**: Integration with Swagger (`setupSwagger(app)`) is present for API documentation generation.

A recurring pattern observed in this configuration is the heavy reliance on environment variables (e.g., `process.env.FRONTEND_URL`, `process.env.RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `process.env.NODE_ENV`) for various settings, promoting flexibility and ease of deployment across different environments. The inclusion of `manmitr.com` related URLs alongside `kidmantree-backend` in the CORS origins suggests potential inter-project communication or a shared infrastructure/related projects.
