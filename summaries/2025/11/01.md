# Activity Summary for 11/1/2025

## 10:24:43 AM
The changes primarily affect report generation and data visualization components in a React application. The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development and refactoring on October 31, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx`**
    *   **10/31/2025, 9:13:24 AM & 1:29:29 PM:** The file defines a `GenerateReport` component responsible for creating brand reports. It includes PDF generation logic using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`, with functionality to embed clickable links. Initial versions include a large `parsedData` object with hardcoded narrative examples related to "BookMyShow." Several state variables are defined for report parameters (customer, brand, date range, loading state) and various data points (usage, brand summary, narratives, competitors).
    *   **10/31/2025, 1:33:25 PM - 4:02:02 PM:** A significant change where the **entire file's content is commented out**. This suggests a temporary disabling of the report generation feature, likely for focused development or debugging.
    *   **10/31/2025, 4:15:04 PM:** The file is uncommented and undergoes a major functional overhaul. The previously hardcoded `parsedData` is removed. New interfaces (`BrandCompetitorData`) are introduced, and the component shifts to fetching data dynamically from a `userService`. New asynchronous functions (`fetchBrandCompetitors`, `fetchAIBrandReport`, `fetchCompetitorReports`, `fetchAllApis`) are added to retrieve customer, brand, sentiment, regional mentions, and competitor narrative data from backend services. The `calculateDateRange` function is refined to format dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`. The PDF generation mechanism remains intact.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\BrandSummary.tsx`**
    *   **10/31/2025, 2:13:00 PM & 2:13:33 PM:** This component is designed to display a brand summary, including top publications, top journalists, sentiment score, regional mentions, and brand mention types. It uses `ReactApexChart` and `react-d3-speedometer` for data visualization. Data transformation functions are implemented (`transformPublicationsData`, `transformJournalistsData`, `transformRegionalData`, `transformBrandMentionData`) to process incoming props into chart-ready formats. The `calculateSentimentScore` logic is also present. The 2:13:33 PM change corrected a minor typo in a console log (`c console.log` to `console.log`).
    *   **10/31/2025, 3:12:12 PM - 3:25:36 PM:** No functional changes observed during these timestamps; the code remains identical to the 2:13:33 PM version.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\CompetitorNarratives.tsx`**
    *   **10/31/2025, 2:34:10 PM:** Introduces a component for paginated competitor narratives. It renders a line chart summarizing narrative timelines and individual narrative cards with details like headline, summary, sentiment, mentioned outlets, authors, and article links. Sentiment is visually indicated by color. The initial header displays "Competitor Narrative."
    *   **10/31/2025, 2:34:26 PM & 2:34:39 PM:** Minor updates, mainly adding a `competitorName` prop to the component interfaces. The display of `competitorName` in the header is not yet dynamic.
    *   **10/31/2025, 2:34:55 PM:** The header (`h1`) for the `FirstPage` component is updated to dynamically include the `competitorName` (e.g., "CompetitorName - Narrative"), with basic capitalization logic applied to the competitor's name.
    *   **10/31/2025, 2:35:24 PM:** The `NarrativePage` component's props are updated to include `competitorName`.
    *   **10/31/2025, 2:43:47 PM - 2:54:55 PM:** Similar to `BrandReport.tsx`, **the entire file's content is commented out**, indicating a temporary deactivation of this feature.
    *   **10/31/2025, 3:03:48 PM:** The file is uncommented. The dynamic title logic in `FirstPage` (from 2:34:55 PM) is now functional. The `NarrativePage` also incorporates `competitorName` into its heading to display "CompetitorName - Page X". The "No narratives to display" message in `PaginatedNarratives` also uses the `competitorName`.
    *   **10/31/2025, 4:12:17 PM:** A minor adjustment: the `h1` title within the `NarrativePage` component (for "CompetitorName - Page X") is commented out, while the `FirstPage` header displaying "CompetitorName - Narrative" remains active.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\BrandMonthlyReport\Narratives.tsx`**
    *   **10/31/2025, 2:45:48 PM:** This component mirrors the structure of `CompetitorNarratives.tsx` but is intended for the main brand's narratives. It features a timeline chart and detailed narrative cards, including sentiment display and article links. The header displays "Brand Narrative." Includes `console.log` for debugging.
    *   **10/31/2025, 2:55:42 PM:** The `PaginatedNarratives` component now accepts an optional `competitorName` prop. The main title for "Brand Narrative" in `PaginatedNarratives` is conditionally updated to show "CompetitorName - Brand Narrative" if a `competitorName` is provided, otherwise it defaults to "Brand Narrative." The `h1` title within the `NarrativePage` component itself remains commented out.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **PDF Generation:** The application heavily relies on `jspdf` and `html2canvas` for generating PDF reports, including advanced features like clickable links within the generated PDF.
*   **Data Visualization:** `ReactApexChart` is consistently used across multiple components (`BrandSummary`, `CompetitorNarratives`, `Narratives`) for displaying various charts (bar charts, donut charts, line charts for timelines). `react-d3-speedometer` is used for sentiment scores.
*   **Narrative Structure:** A consistent data structure `NarrativeData` (with fields like `headline`, `summary`, `sentiment`, `mentioned_outlets`, `authors`, `article_links`, `timeline`) is utilized across `CompetitorNarratives.tsx` and `Narratives.tsx`, highlighting a standardized approach to displaying narrative content.
*   **Timestamp-Based Commenting Out:** A notable pattern is the temporary commenting out of entire files (`BrandReport.tsx`, `CompetitorNarratives.tsx`) for several hours between approximately 1:30 PM and 4:00 PM on October 31, 2025, suggesting a focused development or refactoring effort that temporarily disabled parts of the application.
*   **Transition to Dynamic Data:** A key theme is the shift from hardcoded data (e.g., in `BrandReport.tsx`'s `parsedData`) to fetching data dynamically via `userService` API calls. This indicates a move towards a more robust and data-driven application.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `pdf-section`, `bg-white`, `rounded-[8px]`, `border`, font sizes and weights, specific color hex codes like `#01438D`, `#1678CF`) are used uniformly for styling components, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the generated reports.
*   **Debugging Statements:** Frequent `console.log` statements are present, especially in `BrandSummary.tsx` and `Narratives.tsx`, indicating active development and debugging during these changes.
*   **Page Pagination for Narratives:** Both `CompetitorNarratives.tsx` and `Narratives.tsx` implement a `PaginatedNarratives` structure, suggesting reports can contain a large number of narratives broken down into multiple pages.
*   **Dynamic Report Titles:** Components now dynamically adjust report titles based on props like `competitorName`, providing more contextual information in the generated reports.
