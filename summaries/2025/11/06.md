# Activity Summary for 11/6/2025

## 12:10:40 AM
The changes log details updates across several React components, primarily focusing on implementing role-based access control and premium content gating, alongside data fetching and rendering enhancements. The timestamps, all on 11/4/2025, indicate a concentrated period of development activity.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\JP\BehavioralPattern.jsx` (Timestamp: 11/4/2025, 1:48:48 PM)**
    This component, responsible for displaying journalist behavioral patterns, underwent significant restructuring. It now imports `usePopup` and `tokenService` to manage premium access. Data fetching for `spokespersonData`, `topicsData`, and `brand` information is consolidated into a single call to the `JOURNALISTBRAND` API endpoint. Previously separate API calls for `JOURNALISTSPOKESPERSON` and `JOURNALISTTOPICS` are now commented out. The component implements conditional rendering: if the user's `roleType` (obtained from `tokenService.getLocalRole()`) includes "Freebies" and data exists, content areas (Column Chart, Spokespeople/Topics list) are blurred, and an "Upgrade to View" prompt with a popup link is displayed. Otherwise, the actual `ColoumnChart` and `Spokesperson`/`Topics` data are rendered. `Skeleton` components are extensively used for loading states, including within the blurred premium sections.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\JP\LineChart.jsx` (Timestamp: 11/4/2025, 1:49:02 PM)**
    This component displays a journalist's frequency chart. It now receives `show` (a popup function) and `roleType` as props. It fetches article frequency data using the `JOURFREQCOUNT` endpoint. Similar to `BehavioralPattern.jsx`, it restricts access for "Freebies" users: if `roleType` includes "Freebies" and chart data is available, the chart area is blurred, and an "Upgrade to View" button (linked to the `show` popup) is presented. For premium users, a `react-apexcharts` line chart is rendered. `Skeleton` loaders are used during the blurred premium view.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Dashboard\Skribe365.jsx` (Timestamp: 11/4/2025, 2:04:50 PM and 11/4/2025, 2:05:31 PM)**
    This component showcases "Skribe 365" articles (Journalist/Influencer Moves And Changes).
    The initial change (2:04:50 PM) introduced `usePopup` and `tokenService`. It made data fetching for `SKRIBE365` articles conditional, fetching only if the `roleType` is *not* "Freebies". The component then displayed a placeholder "Upgrade to View" block with blurred content and `Skeleton` loaders, implying that the actual content was not yet rendered in this state.
    A rapid subsequent update (2:05:31 PM) refined the conditional rendering logic significantly. It now explicitly checks if `roleType` *includes* "Freebies." If true, it renders the blurred premium content block with the "Upgrade to View" popup. Otherwise, it proceeds to fetch and render the actual `Skribe365` articles, grouped by `primaryBeat`, with `Skeleton` loaders for the loading state of the content itself. Each article includes a `ReadMore` component using `DOMPurify` for content sanitization, and a "View All" link.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Premium Content Gating:** A strong and consistent pattern across all updated components is the implementation of premium content gating for "Freebies" users. This involves blurring sensitive data sections and overlaying them with an "Unlock More with Premium" message and an "Upgrade to View" call-to-action that triggers a global `showPopup` function.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** User roles are consistently checked using `tokenService.getLocalRole()`, and this `roleType` determines whether blurred premium content or actual data is displayed, and sometimes even whether data is fetched.
*   **Loading Skeletons:** `react-loading-skeleton` is extensively used in all components to provide a smooth user experience during data loading, both for standard content and within the blurred premium views.
*   **`userService` for API Interactions:** All components rely on `userService.get()` to fetch data from various backend endpoints (`JOURNALISTBRAND`, `JOURFREQCOUNT`, `SKRIBE365`).
*   **`useEffect` for Data Management:** Data fetching logic is encapsulated within `useEffect` hooks, typically triggered by changes in `id` or `roleType`.
*   **Next.js `Link`:** The `Link` component from Next.js is used for navigation and for triggering the upgrade popup function.
*   **Timestamp Consistency:** All changes occurred on the same date (11/4/2025), indicating a focused development effort, likely related to implementing or refining premium feature access and associated UI/UX.

## 12:10:42 AM
The primary focus of the changes revolves around the `BrandReport.tsx` file, with a configuration update in `config.ts`.

### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx`

**Timestamp: 11/4/2025, 9:57:23 AM**
This initial state of the `BrandReport.tsx` file establishes a React component (`GenerateReport`) responsible for generating brand reports, including AI-driven insights and competitor narratives.

Key functionalities implemented at this point include:
*   **PDF Generation Setup:** Utilizes `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` for converting HTML sections into a PDF, with special handling (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) for styling and `downloadPDFWithLinks` for preserving clickable links within the PDF. The initial PDF creation uses custom format based on image dimensions.
*   **State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` hooks to manage various report parameters like selected customer, brand, reporting period, loading status, and fetched data (usage, performance, brand summary, narratives, competitor data, sentiment scores).
*   **API Integrations:** Defines asynchronous functions (`fetchBrandCompetitors`, `fetchAIBrandReport`, `fetchCompetitorReports`, `fetchAllApis`, `fetchMonthName`) to interact with a `userService` to retrieve data.
*   **Date Range Calculation:** `calculateDateRange` function dynamically determines start and end dates based on user-selected periods (1, 3, 6, or 12 months).
*   **Data Aggregation (`fetchAllApis`):** This function orchestrates multiple API calls concurrently (`Promise.all`) to gather usage data, AI brand reports (for the main brand), and brand mention statistics. It includes detailed console logs for debugging purposes and logic to handle different structures of the AI brand report response (`aiBrandReportRes?.result` vs. top-level `aiBrandReportRes`). It also limits competitor reports to the top 3.
*   **User Feedback:** Integrates `Alert` and `SweetAlert2` for user notifications and confirmations.
*   The `generatePdfBlob` function for creating a PDF blob is partially defined/truncated.

**Timestamp: 11/4/2025, 9:58:20 AM**
A minor refinement was made to the `fetchAllApis` function:
*   The logic for setting and logging `regionalMention` was slightly simplified. It changed from `aiBrandReportRes.result.regionalMention || aiBrandReportRes.regionalMention` to consistently checking `aiBrandReportRes?.regionalMention`, implying a more standardized structure was expected or preferred.
*   No other significant structural or functional changes were introduced; the `generatePdfBlob` function remained truncated.

**Timestamp: 11/4/2025, 10:49:38 AM**
This update represents a significant enhancement to the PDF generation and a cleanup of debugging output:
*   **PDF Pagination (`generatePdfBlob`):** The previously truncated `generatePdfBlob` function was substantially expanded to include robust pagination logic. Instead of just adding full sections, it now intelligently slices large HTML sections into multiple PDF pages if they exceed the A4 format. It calculates `totalPages` and iteratively draws portions of the captured HTML canvas onto new PDF pages, filling the background with a light grey color (`#f5f5f5`). This ensures proper formatting and readability for longer reports.
*   **Console Log Reduction:** Numerous detailed `console.log` statements within the `fetchAllApis` function, which were previously used for debugging, were removed. This suggests the data fetching and processing logic has been stabilized, reducing unnecessary console output in the application.
*   Minor adjustment to `regionalMention` assignment in `fetchAllApis` to `aiBrandReportRes?.regionalMention` in both `if` and `else if` conditions, further standardizing its retrieval.

### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\config.ts`

**Timestamp: 11/4/2025, 11:37:38 AM**
This file defines application-wide configuration settings based on the environment (development, preview, production).
*   It specifies `baseURL` and `imageURL` for each environment.
*   The `preview` and `production` environments include commented-out alternative `baseURL` values, possibly indicating previous deployment strategies or potential future options.
*   Utility functions (`getBaseURL`, `getImageURL`, `isProduction`) are exported to easily access these configurations and determine the current environment mode using `import.meta.env.MODE`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Timestamp Pattern:** All significant changes occurred on `11/4/2025` within a span of approximately one hour and forty minutes, suggesting concentrated development activity.
*   **Focus on Report Generation:** The changes in `BrandReport.tsx` consistently focus on improving the generation and presentation of brand reports, particularly enhancing the PDF export functionality and refining data retrieval.
*   **API Interaction:** The `userService` is a recurring element for all data fetching operations across different report sections, indicating a centralized service for backend communication.
*   **Debugging to Refinement:** The `BrandReport.tsx` file shows a progression from including extensive debugging `console.log` statements to their removal once the logic for data fetching and processing stabilized, alongside a significant enhancement in PDF generation.
*   **Conditional Data Handling:** The code often includes checks for data existence (e.g., `aiBrandReportRes?.result` or `aiBrandReportRes`) when setting state, demonstrating robust error handling or flexible data structure assumptions.

## 12:10:50 AM
The `index.js` file, acting as the main server entry point for the "Crockery-E-com-Backend" project, was consistently configured to integrate various core e-commerce functionalities. On 11/4/2025, 12:38:03 PM, it was set up with Express, a database connection, cookie parsing, CORS, environment variables, and numerous route imports for admin, customer, products, orders, OTP, wishlist/cart, distributors, inquiries, Razorpay, and categories. It defined API routes with a `/api/` prefix and configured CORS to allow access from specific Vercel, Netlify, and localhost origins, along with a high payload size limit of 100mb. Minor updates to the `allowedOrigins` array in `index.js` occurred on 11/5/2025, at 2:21:33 PM (adding an empty string) and 2:21:56 PM (replacing it with `http://localhost:3000`), indicating frontend development or debugging adjustments.

The `productModel.js` file, initially defining a basic product schema, saw a significant update on 11/5/2025, 4:08:55 PM. It was enhanced to include new boolean fields: `isActive`, `bestSeller`, and `hideProduct`, which default to `true`, `false`, and `false` respectively. Crucially, a `pre-save` middleware was added to enforce a business rule: only a maximum of 10 products can be marked as `bestSeller` at any given time, preventing new best sellers from being saved if the limit is reached.

The `productController.js` file underwent extensive changes on 11/5/2025, 4:09:16 PM, to support the new product model fields and introduce comprehensive product management. This included:
*   `createProduct` now accepts `isActive`, `bestSeller`, and `hideProduct` flags.
*   New endpoints: `getActiveProducts` (retrieves products that are active and not hidden) and `getBestSellerProducts` (retrieves active, not hidden, best-seller products).
*   Toggle functions: `toggleProductStatus`, `toggleBestSeller`, and `toggleHideProduct` were added to dynamically change these boolean flags for individual products.
*   `getProductById` and `updateProduct` were updated to handle these new fields and provide detailed product information, including subcategory resolution.

Concurrently, the `productRoutes.js` file was updated on 11/5/2025, 4:09:42 PM, to expose these new functionalities as API endpoints. This involved adding `GET` routes for `/getactiveproducts` and `/getbestsellerproducts`, and `PATCH` routes for `/togglestatus/:id`, `/togglebestseller/:id`, and `/togglehide/:id`, alongside existing CRUD operations.

Further, the `customerOrderModel.js` file was introduced on 11/5/2025, 5:30:59 PM, establishing a detailed schema for customer orders. This schema captures extensive information including `invoiceDetails` (with `invoiceNo` and `invoiceDate`), references to `customer`, `billingAddress`, `shippingAddress`, and `products` (storing quantity and price at order time). It also defines `shippingMethod`, `orderStatus` (Pending, Confirmed, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled), `paymentStatus` (Pending, Confirmed, Failed), `additionalCharges`, `paymentTotal`, `orderNote`, `discount`, and `cancellationReason`.

Finally, the `customerOrderController.js` file was added on 11/5/2025, 5:31:15 PM, providing a complete suite of order management functions:
*   `createOrder` and `createOrderByCustomer`: Functions for creating new orders, which automatically generate an `invoiceNo` (e.g., `MKNIND1`, `MKNIND2`) and set the `invoiceDate`. `createOrderByCustomer` adds more default statuses.
*   `getAllOrders`, `getOrderById`, `getOrdersByCustomerId`: Functions to retrieve orders with robust filtering, population of customer and product details, and a sophisticated manual population of `billingAddress` and `shippingAddress` by searching within the customer's `addresses` array.
*   `updateOrder` and `deleteOrder`: Standard functions for modifying and removing orders.
*   `changeOrderStatus`: A specific function to update only the `orderStatus`, `paymentStatus`, and `cancellationReason`.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   All significant development activity logged occurred on 11/5/2025, indicating a focused period of feature implementation, particularly for product and order management.
*   A consistent modular architecture (Models, Controllers, Routes) is used across the backend.
*   The project extensively leverages Mongoose for database interaction, including `populate` for relationships and `pre-save` hooks for custom logic and data integrity.
*   Common e-commerce features like product catalog management (status, best-sellers) and comprehensive order processing (invoicing, status tracking, address management) are central.
*   There's a recurring need for data validation and default values both in schemas and controller logic.
*   The system uses an auto-incrementing invoice number generation pattern prefixed with "MKNIND" for customer orders.

## 9:53:52 AM
**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\Reports\BrandReport.tsx`**

This file, a React component named `GenerateReport`, is responsible for generating brand reports, including the capability to export them as PDFs.

*   **11/4/2025, 9:57:23 AM**: The initial state of this log entry shows a comprehensive component structure. It imports various modules for UI components (e.g., `UsageAndPerformance`, `BrandSummary`, `Narratives`), utility services (`userService`, `Alert`, `Swal`), and PDF generation (`jsPDF`, `html2canvas`). Several state variables are defined to manage customer selection, brand details, reporting periods, loading status, and various report data points like usage, performance, sentiment, and narratives for the main brand and competitors. Key functions include `calculateDateRange` for date filtering, `fetchBrandCompetitors`, `fetchAIBrandReport`, `fetchCompetitorReports` to interact with backend services, and `fetchAllApis` to orchestrate data fetching. PDF generation is initiated through `downloadPDFWithLinks` and an incomplete `generatePdfBlob` function. Extensive `console.log` statements are present, likely for debugging API responses and state updates.
*   **11/4/2025, 9:58:20 AM**: A minor change occurred, primarily involving the simplification of how certain `aiBrandReportRes` properties (`regionalMention`, `outletCounts`, `authorCounts`) are accessed and logged. Specifically, conditional checks for a `result` property were removed in favor of direct (optional chaining) access, suggesting a slight adjustment in the expected structure of the `aiBrandReportRes` object or a simplification of access logic. The `generatePdfBlob` function remained incomplete at this point.
*   **11/4/2025, 10:49:38 AM**: This update marks a significant refinement and expansion. All the detailed `console.log` statements within the `fetchAllApis` function (which were used for debugging API responses and final state values) were removed, indicating a cleanup after successful debugging. Most notably, the `generatePdfBlob` function was fully implemented. This implementation introduces advanced PDF pagination logic: it captures HTML sections as canvas images, then slices these images to fit within A4 pages of the PDF, adding a light grey background to each segment to ensure proper rendering across multiple pages.

**File: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\config.ts`**

This file defines environment-specific configuration URLs for the application.

*   **11/4/2025, 11:37:38 AM**: This entry shows the configuration for `development`, `preview`, and `production` environments. The `baseURL` for the `preview` environment was explicitly set to `https://beta.goskribe.com`, and for the `production` environment to `https://goskribe.com`. Previous alternative `baseURL` values were commented out. It also includes helper functions (`getBaseURL`, `getImageURL`, `isProduction`) to programmatically retrieve these configuration values based on the application's current mode.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging and Cleanup:** The changes in `BrandReport.tsx` show a clear pattern of iterative development involving extensive logging for debugging, followed by the removal of these logs once the functionality (especially data fetching and processing) is stable.
*   **Progressive PDF Generation Implementation:** The evolution of the `generatePdfBlob` function in `BrandReport.tsx` demonstrates a multi-stage development, starting from an incomplete function to a fully fledged implementation with advanced features like pagination.
*   **Configuration Management:** The `config.ts` file consistently uses an environment-based approach to manage API and image URLs, ensuring the application points to the correct resources in different deployment stages.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** The timestamps indicate focused development on the `BrandReport.tsx` file in the morning (9:57 AM to 10:49 AM), followed by a separate configuration update later (11:37 AM).
