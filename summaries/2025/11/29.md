# Activity Summary for 11/29/2025

## 12:30:43 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Kidmantree\kidmantree-backend\app.js`, updated on **11/28/2025, 8:14:27 PM**, configures the main Express application.

**Key Updates and Configurations:**

*   **Core Setup:** Initializes Express with essential middleware for web development, including `cors`, `helmet`, `morgan`, `compression`, and `express-rate-limit`.
*   **Security & CORS:**
    *   `helmet` is configured with `crossOriginResourcePolicy: { policy: "cross-origin" }`.
    *   `cors` is extensively configured to allow specific origins, including `localhost:3000`, `localhost:5173`, `localhost:8000`, `https://app.manmitr.com`, `http://manmitr.com`, `https://api.manmitr.com`, `https://kidmantree-backend-g2la.onrender.com`, and `https://manmitr.onrender.com`. It also sets `credentials: true`.
    *   `express-rate-limit` is applied to all `/api` routes, with `windowMs` and `max` requests configurable via environment variables (`RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`).
*   **Data Handling:**
    *   `compression` middleware is used for response compression.
    *   `express.json` and `express.urlencoded` are configured with a `limit: "10mb"` for parsing incoming request bodies.
*   **Logging:**
    *   `morgan` is set up with the "combined" format, directing its output to a custom `logger` utility for consistent logging.
*   **Static File Serving:** The application serves static files from an `uploads` directory, accessible via the `/uploads` endpoint.
*   **Routing & API:** All API routes are mounted under the `/api` prefix.
*   **Documentation:** Swagger documentation is integrated and set up using `setupSwagger(app)`.
*   **Health Check:** A dedicated `/health` endpoint is provided, returning the application's status, timestamp, uptime, and environment (from `process.env.NODE_ENV`).
*   **Error Handling:** Custom `notFoundHandler` and `errorHandler` middleware are used to gracefully manage 404 errors and other application errors.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Environment Variable Reliance:** The configuration heavily relies on `process.env` for dynamic settings like CORS origins, rate limiting parameters, and the application environment, indicating a robust deployment strategy.
*   **Comprehensive Middleware Usage:** The file demonstrates a standard pattern of including a wide range of Express middleware for common backend concerns such as security, logging, performance (compression), and data parsing.
*   **Modular Structure:** It imports various utilities and components (logger, error handlers, routes, swagger setup) from dedicated files, suggesting a well-organized project structure.
*   **Focus on Production Readiness:** The inclusion of Helmet, CORS with specific origins (including Render.com and Manmitr.com deployments), rate limiting, compression, and a health check endpoint indicates a strong emphasis on security, performance, and monitoring for a production environment.
