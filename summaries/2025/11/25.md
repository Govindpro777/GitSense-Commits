# Activity Summary for 11/25/2025

## 9:12:13 AM
The provided code changes primarily revolve around implementing and refining PDF report generation for a React-based frontend application, specifically within the `src/components/Brand/Report` directory. The reports include "Report", "MediaScore", "Sentiment", "ShareOfVoiceReport", "SpokePersonReport", and "CatelogReport".

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:28:07 AM - 10:31:57 AM**
        *   Initial implementation and minor adjustments to PDF generation logic using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`.
        *   The `applyStyle` function, responsible for injecting CSS to fix display issues (e.g., `img, svg, video, canvas` having `display: initial !important; vertical-align: initial !important;`), was introduced, then temporarily commented out, then re-enabled.
        *   A temporary `pdf-color-fix` style to force black text and white background during PDF generation was briefly added (10:28:24 AM) but later removed.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:38:49 AM**
        *   The `html2canvas` import was changed to `html2canvas-pro`, suggesting a switch to a potentially commercial or enhanced version of the library.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:40:45 AM**
        *   The main `div` containing the report components (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`) had its class name `.pdf-section` removed, then later re-added.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:47:22 AM**
        *   A `font-inter` class was added to the main report container for consistent font styling.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 11:29:09 AM**
        *   Integration of `SpokePersonReport` into the main `Report` component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 12:34:48 PM**
        *   Integration of `CatelogReport` into the main `Report` component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 4:26:55 PM onwards**
        *   The `Report` component was updated to accept props (`msSelectedComps`, `sentiSelectedComps`, `sovSelectedComps`, `spokesSelectedComps`, `catalogSelectedComps`, `msMentionCountMediaTypes`), indicating a shift towards dynamic rendering of report sections based on user selections. Console logs were added to debug these props.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:43:20 AM - 10:52:45 AM**
        *   Refinements to chart heights (`qualityPieChartData`, `impactLineChartData`, `mentionBarChartData`) and minor styling adjustments (font sizes, axis colors) for better PDF rendering. The component layout remained consistent, displaying media impact score, competitor ranking, quality of mentions, media impact score trend, and media mention count.
        *   The section containing the entire `MediaScore` report was given the class `pdf-section` to enable its capture for PDF generation.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 4:37:31 PM onwards**
        *   The component was updated to receive `msSelectedComps` (Media Score Selected Components) as a prop, enabling conditional rendering of different sections.
        *   Dynamic data fetching logic was introduced for "Media Impact Score Chart" and "Media Mention Count" sections using `useEffect` hooks and `userService`. This means these sections will now fetch real data if their respective components are selected, rather than using dummy data.
        *   The rendering of "Media Impact Score" and "Media Mention Count" charts became conditional on `msSelectedComps` and the availability of data. Loading indicators were also added.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:50:28 AM - 10:51:35 AM**
        *   Minor styling adjustments: `mb-4` changed to `mb-2` for performance metrics, and `min-h-[841px]` removed from the main section, indicating layout tweaks.
        *   Commented out sections for "Company Narratives" and "Competitor Narratives", simplifying the report content.
        *   Similar to `MediaScore.jsx`, this component was wrapped in a `<section className="pdf-section">` for PDF generation.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:51:46 AM - 10:52:20 AM**
        *   Minor styling updates, specifically adding `min-h-[841px]` to the main `section` and adjusting `px-3 py-2` in table headers for consistency.
        *   The component was also wrapped in a `<section className="pdf-section">`.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 11:21:02 AM**
        *   Initial creation of the component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 11:28:53 AM**
        *   Significant expansion: The component was populated with state management for date ranges, loading indicators, and data fetched from `userService` endpoints (`SPOKESPERSON_MENTIONS`, `SPOKESPERSON_SENTIMENT_CHART`, `SPOKESPERSON_NO_OF_MENTIONS`). It also introduced `ReactSpeedometer` for displaying mention changes and `Chart` for sentiment and monthly mention graphs.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 11:32:21 AM - 12:29:31 PM**
        *   The dynamic data fetching logic was largely replaced by static dummy data for demonstration purposes, suggesting a shift from live API integration to a mock data setup for report rendering.
        *   Extensive styling updates were applied (e.g., `w-full xl:w-11/12` to `w-1/2`, `min-h-[841px]`, padding, border, shadow styles) to match the layout and appearance of other report components. Chart configurations were also adjusted (e.g., height, `plotOptions.bar.horizontal`).
        *   The component was wrapped in a `<section className="pdf-section">`.

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 12:29:51 PM**
        *   Initial creation of the component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 12:34:23 PM - 1:26:27 PM**
        *   Expanded with dummy article data and UI for displaying articles, outlet tags, and a disabled pagination section.
        *   Layout and styling adjustments (e.g., `w-1/2`, `min-h-[841px]`, `rounded-lg`, header, article card styling).
        *   The component was wrapped in a `<section className="pdf-section">`.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\GenerateReport\GenerateReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 4:10:07 PM onwards**
        *   This component manages the selection state for various report sections (Media Score, Sentiment, Share of Voice, Spokesperson, Catalog).
        *   Dropdowns and checkboxes allow users to select which sub-components of each report type should be included.
        *   `handleSelectAllDD` function was added to quickly select all sub-components within each report type.
        *   Date range handling logic (`handleDateRangeChange`) was implemented, allowing users to choose predefined periods (Last 24 hours, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months) or a custom range.
        *   The main `Report` component is now rendered, receiving the selected components as props, enabling a configurable report generation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **PDF Generation Focus:** A strong and consistent pattern across `Report.jsx` is the use of `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` (specifically `html2canvas-pro`) for client-side PDF generation. The `downloadPDFWithLinks` function is central, iterating over `.pdf-section` elements, converting them to images, and adding them to a PDF document, along with clickable links.
*   **Styling for PDF Export:** There are recurring efforts to apply specific CSS styles (`applyStyle` function) to ensure elements render correctly in the PDF, especially for images and media. The frequent adjustments to `min-h-[841px]` and `w-1/2` (or `w-[595px]`) within the report components suggest an attempt to fit content onto standard A4-like pages for portrait orientation.
*   **Component-Based Reporting:** The reports are modularized into individual React components (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`), each focusing on a specific aspect of brand reporting. These are then aggregated in the main `Report` component.
*   **Chart Visualization:** `react-apexcharts` and `react-d3-speedometer` are heavily used to render various data visualizations (pie charts, bar charts, line charts, speedometers) across `MediaScoreReport`, `SentimentReport`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, and `SpokePersonReport`. Chart configurations often include consistent `fontFamily: "Inter, sans-serif"` and similar color palettes (`#6366F1`, `#06B6D4`, `#FB923C`, `#10B981`).
*   **Dummy Data to Dynamic Data Transition:** `SpokePersonReport` and `MediaScoreReport` show a clear evolution from using static "dummy data" for development and testing to integrating with `userService` to fetch actual data from API endpoints. This indicates a progression in feature development from UI/UX design to backend integration.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The `GenerateReport.jsx` component introduces a robust mechanism for conditionally rendering sections within the final PDF report based on user selections. This suggests a customizable report feature is being built.
*   **Consistent UI/UX Elements:** The report sections often feature a "Header with Logo," a main title (`<h1>`), sub-sections with titles (`<h3>`, `<h4>`), and a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., `bg-white rounded-xl p-4 border border-[#00000033] mb-4`).
*   **Date Range Management:** Multiple components (e.g., `SpokePersonReport`, `GenerateReport`) implement state and handlers for selecting date ranges (e.g., "Last 1 month", "Custom Date Range"), indicating that time-based filtering is a crucial feature.

In summary, the logs illustrate an active development phase focused on building a comprehensive and customizable PDF report generation system for brand analysis. Key activities include integrating PDF libraries, refining component layouts for print, implementing various chart types, transitioning from mock data to real data (and sometimes reverting to mock data for specific development stages), and developing selection mechanisms for report content.

## 10:12:22 AM
The log primarily details changes across three React components related to report generation: `Report.jsx`, `MediaScore.jsx`, `Sentiment.jsx`, `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`, `SpokePersonReport.jsx`, and `CatelogReport.jsx`. The changes occurred on **November 24, 2025**, between **10:28:07 AM** and **5:36:42 PM**.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10:28:07 AM - 10:29:43 AM**: Initial setup for PDF generation using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`. It includes `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` functions to fix styling issues during PDF conversion (e.g., `img`, `svg` display properties). The PDF generation logic iterates through `".pdf-section"` elements, converts them to images, and adds them to the PDF, also adding clickable links.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:28:24 AM**: Temporarily commented out the original `pdf-style-fix` and introduced a new `pdf-color-fix` style to force all text and backgrounds to black and white during PDF generation, likely to address color rendering issues. This change was later reverted.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:31:57 AM**: The `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` functions, along with their calls within `downloadPDFWithLinks`, were commented out. This suggests an attempt to disable style manipulation during PDF generation, possibly due to issues or seeking alternative solutions.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:38:49 AM**: Changed the import for `html2canvas` from `"html2canvas"` to `"html2canvas-pro"`, indicating an upgrade or a switch to a professional version of the library. The style functions (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) remained commented out.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:40:25 AM**: The `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` functions were re-enabled, and the original `pdf-style-fix` CSS was uncommented and reinstated. This suggests that the styling issues were still present or the previous disabling caused other problems.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:40:45 AM**: Removed the `pdf-section` class from the main `div` containing `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport` components within the `Report` component's render method. This likely altered how `downloadPDFWithLinks` identifies sections for PDF conversion.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:47:22 AM**: Added `mx-auto font-inter` classes to the main report container, likely for styling and centering.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:53:29 AM - 10:55:53 AM**: The outer `div` containing the download button and report content was wrapped with various utility classes (`mx-auto`, `p-10`, `items-center`, `flex`, `flex-col`, `justify-center`, `text-center`) for layout and centering, with slight variations and adjustments. A `pdfRef` was temporarily added to a `div` but later removed, suggesting exploration of different methods for PDF export targeting.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:59:10 AM - 10:59:37 AM**: The "Download Report" button was temporarily commented out, then uncommented with revised parent container styling. This indicates UI adjustments and testing of the download functionality.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:00:07 AM**: The "Download Report" button was uncommented and the wrapper styles were simplified back to `className="mx-auto p-10 items-center"`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:29:09 AM**: Imported `SpokePersonReport` and added it to the report display.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:34:48 PM**: Imported `CatelogReport` and added it to the report display.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:26:55 PM - 04:36:16 PM**: The `Report` component started accepting props `msSelectedComps`, `sentiSelectedComps`, `sovSelectedComps`, `spokesSelectedComps`, and `catalogSelectedComps`. `console.log` statements were added to log `msSelectedComps` for debugging purposes, indicating the beginning of dynamic component rendering based on selected report sections.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:57:50 PM**: Passed `msSelectedComps` as a prop to the `MediaScore` component, enabling conditional rendering within `MediaScore`. Also added `msMentionCountMediaTypes` prop to `Report` component.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10:43:20 AM - 10:46:09 AM**: Extensive styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS classes were applied to the main `section` tag and its child elements, specifically related to width (`w-1/2` vs `w-[595px]`), minimum height (`min-h-[841px]`), background (`bg-[#f5f5f5]`), and padding. Font sizes for chart labels and legends were adjusted (`fontSize: "9px"` for axes, `10px` for pie chart labels, `9px` for legends). Chart heights for pie, line, and bar charts were increased (`height: 220` from `140` for pie, `240` from `180` for line and bar). This demonstrates a focus on improving the visual presentation and layout of the Media Score report section.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:52:00 AM - 10:52:45 AM**: Reverted `w-[595px]` back to `w-1/2` on the main `section` tag.
    *   **Timestamp: 01:33:48 PM**: Removed the `misComponents` dummy data.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:05:32 PM**: No significant functional changes; a minor formatting change.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:37:31 PM - 04:37:56 PM**: `MediaScoreReport` component started accepting `msSelectedComps` as a prop and added a `console.log` for debugging it.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:46:08 PM**: Imported `MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA` from `@/constants`.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:46:46 PM**: Imported `userService` from `@/Services/user.service`.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:53:47 PM**: Introduced state variables `mediaImpactGraphData` and `loading`. Added a `useEffect` hook to conditionally fetch `MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA` using `userService.get` when `msSelectedComps` includes "Media Impact Score Chart". If not included, `mediaImpactGraphData` is reset. The `transformMediaImpactData` function was updated to process the fetched data dynamically, and the `Media Impact Score` chart's rendering now depends on `msSelectedComps` and `loading` states. This marks a shift from static dummy data to dynamic data fetching for at least one chart.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:58:07 PM**: No significant functional changes.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:58:28 PM**: `MediaScoreReport` component started receiving `msMentionCountMediaTypes` prop, and a `console.log` was added for debugging it.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:02:13 PM - 05:09:52 PM**: Portions of the code were commented out and re-enabled, suggesting active development and testing of components, particularly regarding data fetching logic.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:10:57 PM**: Imported `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA` from `@/constants`. The `useEffect` logic was updated to also fetch `Media Mention Count` data when `msSelectedComps` includes it, calling a new `fetchMediaMentionCountData` function.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:12:35 PM**: Added `mediaMentionCountData` state and updated the `useEffect` to fetch `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA` using a `userService.post` request with `selectedMediaTypes` (which is not yet defined in the snippet, likely `msMentionCountMediaTypes`).
    *   **Timestamp: 05:13:34 PM**: Corrected the `userService.post` call for `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA` to use `msMentionCountMediaTypes`. Added error handling for `fetchMediaMentionCountData`.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:14:21 PM**: Declared a `media` state variable without initialization, which was quickly removed.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:16:04 PM**: Implemented `transformMediaMentionCountData` to prepare data for the "Media Mention Count" stacked bar chart and updated the chart's rendering to depend on `msSelectedComps` and fetched `mediaMentionCountData`.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:20:16 PM - 05:25:16 PM**: Large sections of the code were commented out in `MediaScore.jsx`, then re-enabled, indicating a testing or refactoring phase.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:26:41 PM**: Implemented conditional rendering for the "Media Impact Score" and "Media Mention Count" sections based on whether their respective component names are present in `msSelectedComps`. This is crucial for dynamic report generation.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10:50:28 AM**: Removed previously commented-out `companyNarratives` and `competitorNarratives` dummy data sections, simplifying the component to focus on performance metrics and comparative analysis. Adjusted `min-h-[841px]` to `min-h-[841px]` and changed `mb-4` to `mb-2` for performance metrics section.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:50:53 AM**: Changed `min-h-[841px]` to `min-h-[841px]` for the main section.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:51:19 AM**: Removed `min-h-[841px]` from the main `section` tag.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:51:35 AM**: Reverted `min-h-[841px]` for the main `section` tag.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10:51:46 AM**: No major functional changes, but minor styling adjustments were made to the main `section` tag (`w-1/2` and `min-h-[841px]`).
    *   **Timestamp: 10:52:20 AM**: Reverted the `width` property on the main `section` tag to `w-1/2` and added `min-h-[841px]`.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11:21:02 AM**: Initial creation of `SpokePersonReport` component as a placeholder.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:28:53 AM**: Expanded `SpokePersonReport` with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), dynamic imports for charts (`react-apexcharts`, `react-d3-speedometer`), service calls (`userService`), and local storage (`useLocalStorage`, `useNotification`). It introduced fetching data for spokesperson mentions, sentiment, and monthly mention graphs, and includes UI elements like a brand header, date range filters, speedometer, sentiment bar chart, and a table of top spokespersons. Dummy `ATTACH_URL` was present.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:29:44 AM**: Corrected string concatenation for `ATTACH_URL` by removing an extra `+` sign.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:32:21 AM**: Removed dynamic data fetching logic (API calls, `useState`, `useEffect` for data management) and replaced it with inline dummy data for `spokespersonMentions`, `mentionGraphData`, `noOfMentionsData`, `sentimentScore`, and `sentimentData`. The chart configurations (`monthlyChartData`, `sentimentChartData`) were also updated to use this dummy data. The overall layout and styling were adjusted to match the other report components (e.g., `w-1/2`, `min-h-[841px]`, `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `p-6`). The horizontal bar chart was changed to vertical with updated `xaxis` categories.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:37:04 AM**: Reverted the horizontal bar chart for monthly mentions back to horizontal (`plotOptions.bar.horizontal: true`) and adjusted chart height to `180px` (from `300px`). Added more dummy data points for September and October to `mentionGraphData`. Updated `xaxis` and `yaxis` label styles and colors to black. Adjusted `maxSegmentLabels` for `ReactSpeedometer` to `0`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:17:13 PM**: Renamed dummy data variables (e.g., `spokespersonMentions` to `dummySpokespersonMentions`) and updated the component to use these new names. Minor adjustments to the speedometer's `width` and `ringWidth` properties.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:17:51 PM - 12:29:31 PM**: Minor revisions to dummy data naming conventions and chart configurations. The horizontal bar chart for monthly mentions was briefly changed to vertical and then reverted back to horizontal, with minor adjustments to `xaxis` categories. It appears to be experimenting with chart orientation.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:25:25 PM**: The entire content of the file was commented out, likely for a temporary disabling or a large-scale refactoring/testing phase.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:25:48 PM - 12:27:39 PM**: The previously commented-out code was uncommented and reactivated, with some minor adjustments to the dummy `mentionGraphData` (reducing the number of months).

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12:29:51 PM**: Initial creation of `CatelogReport` component as a placeholder.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:34:23 PM**: Expanded `CatelogReport` to display a list of dummy articles with website, title, summary, URL, publish date, and sentiment. It includes an `ArticleCard` sub-component for rendering each article. Basic layout and styling using Tailwind CSS classes (`w-1/2`, `min-h-[841px]`, `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `p-6`). Placeholder UI for date filters and outlet tags is included, along with disabled pagination.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:35:21 PM**: Removed the date filter placeholder HTML elements, indicating a decision to simplify the UI or implement them differently later.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:35:32 PM**: Removed the "Pagination UI disabled" section.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:37:19 PM**: Changed the `div` containing articles to not have `shadow-[0px_2px_4px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]` and removed `max-h-[640px]` from the containing div, then re-added it with `shadow-[0px_2px_4px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]`. Also adjusted the pagination text.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:37:48 PM**: Removed the pagination section completely.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:38:30 PM**: Removed `rounded-md shadow-[0px_2px_4px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]` from the `div` containing the articles.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:38:47 PM**: Removed `max-h-[640px]` from the `div` containing the articles list.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:39:04 PM**: Re-added `rounded-md` and `max-h-[640px]` to the `div` containing the articles list.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:39:16 PM**: Changed `rounded-md` to `rounded-xl` for the div containing the articles.
    *   **Timestamp: 01:26:06 PM - 01:26:27 PM**: Removed one dummy article entry from the `dummyArticles` array, reducing the number of displayed articles.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\GenerateReport\GenerateReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04:10:07 PM**: Introduced a new `GenerateReport` component, responsible for configuring and triggering report generation. It uses local storage (`useLocalStorage`), custom hooks (`useBrandMediaTypes`, `useNotification`), and defines multiple state variables for managing selected components and date ranges across different report sections (Media Score, Sentiment, Share of Voice, Spokesperson, Catalog). It includes `DropdownComponent` and `MultiSelectDropdown` for UI. A `handleSelectAllDD` function is present to select all sub-components within each report category.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:10:34 PM**: No significant functional changes; minor formatting.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:26:03 PM**: No significant functional changes; minor formatting.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **PDF Generation Focus**: The most prominent pattern is the continuous refinement of PDF generation logic in `Report.jsx` using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas(-pro)`. This includes handling styling issues during conversion (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`), iterating through sections for multi-page PDFs, and adding clickable links.
*   **Dummy Data Usage**: Many components initially use or revert to dummy data (`MediaScore.jsx`, `Sentiment.jsx`, `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`, `SpokePersonReport.jsx`, `CatelogReport.jsx`). This suggests that the front-end development is often decoupled from the backend, allowing UI/UX to be built and tested independently.
*   **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `p-6`, `rounded-xl`, `flex`, `grid`, `text-sm`, `font-bold`) across all report components for visual presentation and layout.
*   **Dynamic Charting**: Heavy reliance on `react-apexcharts` for data visualization (pie, line, bar charts). Charts often have customized options for height, colors, legends, axis styles, and data labels.
*   **Conditional Rendering**: The introduction of `msSelectedComps` and other `*SelectedComps` props to `Report.jsx` and subsequent passing to sub-components (`MediaScore.jsx`) indicates a move towards dynamic, customizable report generation, where sections are rendered based on user selection.
*   **Data Fetching (Initial & Reversion)**: `SpokePersonReport.jsx` initially had dynamic data fetching logic with `useEffect` and `userService` calls but then reverted to dummy data, likely to simplify testing or work on UI independently. `MediaScore.jsx` later re-introduced and expanded dynamic data fetching for its charts.
*   **Report Structure**: Each report component (e.g., `MediaScoreReport`, `SentimentReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`) follows a similar structural pattern: a header, followed by multiple sections/cards displaying key metrics, tables, and charts. Each section is wrapped in a `pdf-section` class for PDF generation.
*   **Debugging**: Frequent use of `console.log` statements (e.g., in `Report.jsx` and `MediaScore.jsx`) suggests active debugging of prop passing and data flow during development.
