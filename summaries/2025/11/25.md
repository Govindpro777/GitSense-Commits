# Activity Summary for 11/25/2025

## 9:12:13 AM
The provided code changes primarily revolve around implementing and refining PDF report generation for a React-based frontend application, specifically within the `src/components/Brand/Report` directory. The reports include "Report", "MediaScore", "Sentiment", "ShareOfVoiceReport", "SpokePersonReport", and "CatelogReport".

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:28:07 AM - 10:31:57 AM**
        *   Initial implementation and minor adjustments to PDF generation logic using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`.
        *   The `applyStyle` function, responsible for injecting CSS to fix display issues (e.g., `img, svg, video, canvas` having `display: initial !important; vertical-align: initial !important;`), was introduced, then temporarily commented out, then re-enabled.
        *   A temporary `pdf-color-fix` style to force black text and white background during PDF generation was briefly added (10:28:24 AM) but later removed.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:38:49 AM**
        *   The `html2canvas` import was changed to `html2canvas-pro`, suggesting a switch to a potentially commercial or enhanced version of the library.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:40:45 AM**
        *   The main `div` containing the report components (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`) had its class name `.pdf-section` removed, then later re-added.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:47:22 AM**
        *   A `font-inter` class was added to the main report container for consistent font styling.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 11:29:09 AM**
        *   Integration of `SpokePersonReport` into the main `Report` component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 12:34:48 PM**
        *   Integration of `CatelogReport` into the main `Report` component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 4:26:55 PM onwards**
        *   The `Report` component was updated to accept props (`msSelectedComps`, `sentiSelectedComps`, `sovSelectedComps`, `spokesSelectedComps`, `catalogSelectedComps`, `msMentionCountMediaTypes`), indicating a shift towards dynamic rendering of report sections based on user selections. Console logs were added to debug these props.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:43:20 AM - 10:52:45 AM**
        *   Refinements to chart heights (`qualityPieChartData`, `impactLineChartData`, `mentionBarChartData`) and minor styling adjustments (font sizes, axis colors) for better PDF rendering. The component layout remained consistent, displaying media impact score, competitor ranking, quality of mentions, media impact score trend, and media mention count.
        *   The section containing the entire `MediaScore` report was given the class `pdf-section` to enable its capture for PDF generation.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 4:37:31 PM onwards**
        *   The component was updated to receive `msSelectedComps` (Media Score Selected Components) as a prop, enabling conditional rendering of different sections.
        *   Dynamic data fetching logic was introduced for "Media Impact Score Chart" and "Media Mention Count" sections using `useEffect` hooks and `userService`. This means these sections will now fetch real data if their respective components are selected, rather than using dummy data.
        *   The rendering of "Media Impact Score" and "Media Mention Count" charts became conditional on `msSelectedComps` and the availability of data. Loading indicators were also added.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:50:28 AM - 10:51:35 AM**
        *   Minor styling adjustments: `mb-4` changed to `mb-2` for performance metrics, and `min-h-[841px]` removed from the main section, indicating layout tweaks.
        *   Commented out sections for "Company Narratives" and "Competitor Narratives", simplifying the report content.
        *   Similar to `MediaScore.jsx`, this component was wrapped in a `<section className="pdf-section">` for PDF generation.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 10:51:46 AM - 10:52:20 AM**
        *   Minor styling updates, specifically adding `min-h-[841px]` to the main `section` and adjusting `px-3 py-2` in table headers for consistency.
        *   The component was also wrapped in a `<section className="pdf-section">`.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 11:21:02 AM**
        *   Initial creation of the component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 11:28:53 AM**
        *   Significant expansion: The component was populated with state management for date ranges, loading indicators, and data fetched from `userService` endpoints (`SPOKESPERSON_MENTIONS`, `SPOKESPERSON_SENTIMENT_CHART`, `SPOKESPERSON_NO_OF_MENTIONS`). It also introduced `ReactSpeedometer` for displaying mention changes and `Chart` for sentiment and monthly mention graphs.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 11:32:21 AM - 12:29:31 PM**
        *   The dynamic data fetching logic was largely replaced by static dummy data for demonstration purposes, suggesting a shift from live API integration to a mock data setup for report rendering.
        *   Extensive styling updates were applied (e.g., `w-full xl:w-11/12` to `w-1/2`, `min-h-[841px]`, padding, border, shadow styles) to match the layout and appearance of other report components. Chart configurations were also adjusted (e.g., height, `plotOptions.bar.horizontal`).
        *   The component was wrapped in a `<section className="pdf-section">`.

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 12:29:51 PM**
        *   Initial creation of the component.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 12:34:23 PM - 1:26:27 PM**
        *   Expanded with dummy article data and UI for displaying articles, outlet tags, and a disabled pagination section.
        *   Layout and styling adjustments (e.g., `w-1/2`, `min-h-[841px]`, `rounded-lg`, header, article card styling).
        *   The component was wrapped in a `<section className="pdf-section">`.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\GenerateReport\GenerateReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/24/2025, 4:10:07 PM onwards**
        *   This component manages the selection state for various report sections (Media Score, Sentiment, Share of Voice, Spokesperson, Catalog).
        *   Dropdowns and checkboxes allow users to select which sub-components of each report type should be included.
        *   `handleSelectAllDD` function was added to quickly select all sub-components within each report type.
        *   Date range handling logic (`handleDateRangeChange`) was implemented, allowing users to choose predefined periods (Last 24 hours, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months) or a custom range.
        *   The main `Report` component is now rendered, receiving the selected components as props, enabling a configurable report generation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **PDF Generation Focus:** A strong and consistent pattern across `Report.jsx` is the use of `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` (specifically `html2canvas-pro`) for client-side PDF generation. The `downloadPDFWithLinks` function is central, iterating over `.pdf-section` elements, converting them to images, and adding them to a PDF document, along with clickable links.
*   **Styling for PDF Export:** There are recurring efforts to apply specific CSS styles (`applyStyle` function) to ensure elements render correctly in the PDF, especially for images and media. The frequent adjustments to `min-h-[841px]` and `w-1/2` (or `w-[595px]`) within the report components suggest an attempt to fit content onto standard A4-like pages for portrait orientation.
*   **Component-Based Reporting:** The reports are modularized into individual React components (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`), each focusing on a specific aspect of brand reporting. These are then aggregated in the main `Report` component.
*   **Chart Visualization:** `react-apexcharts` and `react-d3-speedometer` are heavily used to render various data visualizations (pie charts, bar charts, line charts, speedometers) across `MediaScoreReport`, `SentimentReport`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, and `SpokePersonReport`. Chart configurations often include consistent `fontFamily: "Inter, sans-serif"` and similar color palettes (`#6366F1`, `#06B6D4`, `#FB923C`, `#10B981`).
*   **Dummy Data to Dynamic Data Transition:** `SpokePersonReport` and `MediaScoreReport` show a clear evolution from using static "dummy data" for development and testing to integrating with `userService` to fetch actual data from API endpoints. This indicates a progression in feature development from UI/UX design to backend integration.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The `GenerateReport.jsx` component introduces a robust mechanism for conditionally rendering sections within the final PDF report based on user selections. This suggests a customizable report feature is being built.
*   **Consistent UI/UX Elements:** The report sections often feature a "Header with Logo," a main title (`<h1>`), sub-sections with titles (`<h3>`, `<h4>`), and a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., `bg-white rounded-xl p-4 border border-[#00000033] mb-4`).
*   **Date Range Management:** Multiple components (e.g., `SpokePersonReport`, `GenerateReport`) implement state and handlers for selecting date ranges (e.g., "Last 1 month", "Custom Date Range"), indicating that time-based filtering is a crucial feature.

In summary, the logs illustrate an active development phase focused on building a comprehensive and customizable PDF report generation system for brand analysis. Key activities include integrating PDF libraries, refining component layouts for print, implementing various chart types, transitioning from mock data to real data (and sometimes reverting to mock data for specific development stages), and developing selection mechanisms for report content.

## 10:12:22 AM
The log primarily details changes across three React components related to report generation: `Report.jsx`, `MediaScore.jsx`, `Sentiment.jsx`, `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`, `SpokePersonReport.jsx`, and `CatelogReport.jsx`. The changes occurred on **November 24, 2025**, between **10:28:07 AM** and **5:36:42 PM**.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10:28:07 AM - 10:29:43 AM**: Initial setup for PDF generation using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas`. It includes `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` functions to fix styling issues during PDF conversion (e.g., `img`, `svg` display properties). The PDF generation logic iterates through `".pdf-section"` elements, converts them to images, and adds them to the PDF, also adding clickable links.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:28:24 AM**: Temporarily commented out the original `pdf-style-fix` and introduced a new `pdf-color-fix` style to force all text and backgrounds to black and white during PDF generation, likely to address color rendering issues. This change was later reverted.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:31:57 AM**: The `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` functions, along with their calls within `downloadPDFWithLinks`, were commented out. This suggests an attempt to disable style manipulation during PDF generation, possibly due to issues or seeking alternative solutions.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:38:49 AM**: Changed the import for `html2canvas` from `"html2canvas"` to `"html2canvas-pro"`, indicating an upgrade or a switch to a professional version of the library. The style functions (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`) remained commented out.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:40:25 AM**: The `applyStyle` and `removeStyle` functions were re-enabled, and the original `pdf-style-fix` CSS was uncommented and reinstated. This suggests that the styling issues were still present or the previous disabling caused other problems.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:40:45 AM**: Removed the `pdf-section` class from the main `div` containing `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport` components within the `Report` component's render method. This likely altered how `downloadPDFWithLinks` identifies sections for PDF conversion.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:47:22 AM**: Added `mx-auto font-inter` classes to the main report container, likely for styling and centering.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:53:29 AM - 10:55:53 AM**: The outer `div` containing the download button and report content was wrapped with various utility classes (`mx-auto`, `p-10`, `items-center`, `flex`, `flex-col`, `justify-center`, `text-center`) for layout and centering, with slight variations and adjustments. A `pdfRef` was temporarily added to a `div` but later removed, suggesting exploration of different methods for PDF export targeting.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:59:10 AM - 10:59:37 AM**: The "Download Report" button was temporarily commented out, then uncommented with revised parent container styling. This indicates UI adjustments and testing of the download functionality.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:00:07 AM**: The "Download Report" button was uncommented and the wrapper styles were simplified back to `className="mx-auto p-10 items-center"`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:29:09 AM**: Imported `SpokePersonReport` and added it to the report display.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:34:48 PM**: Imported `CatelogReport` and added it to the report display.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:26:55 PM - 04:36:16 PM**: The `Report` component started accepting props `msSelectedComps`, `sentiSelectedComps`, `sovSelectedComps`, `spokesSelectedComps`, and `catalogSelectedComps`. `console.log` statements were added to log `msSelectedComps` for debugging purposes, indicating the beginning of dynamic component rendering based on selected report sections.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:57:50 PM**: Passed `msSelectedComps` as a prop to the `MediaScore` component, enabling conditional rendering within `MediaScore`. Also added `msMentionCountMediaTypes` prop to `Report` component.

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10:43:20 AM - 10:46:09 AM**: Extensive styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS classes were applied to the main `section` tag and its child elements, specifically related to width (`w-1/2` vs `w-[595px]`), minimum height (`min-h-[841px]`), background (`bg-[#f5f5f5]`), and padding. Font sizes for chart labels and legends were adjusted (`fontSize: "9px"` for axes, `10px` for pie chart labels, `9px` for legends). Chart heights for pie, line, and bar charts were increased (`height: 220` from `140` for pie, `240` from `180` for line and bar). This demonstrates a focus on improving the visual presentation and layout of the Media Score report section.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:52:00 AM - 10:52:45 AM**: Reverted `w-[595px]` back to `w-1/2` on the main `section` tag.
    *   **Timestamp: 01:33:48 PM**: Removed the `misComponents` dummy data.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:05:32 PM**: No significant functional changes; a minor formatting change.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:37:31 PM - 04:37:56 PM**: `MediaScoreReport` component started accepting `msSelectedComps` as a prop and added a `console.log` for debugging it.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:46:08 PM**: Imported `MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA` from `@/constants`.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:46:46 PM**: Imported `userService` from `@/Services/user.service`.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:53:47 PM**: Introduced state variables `mediaImpactGraphData` and `loading`. Added a `useEffect` hook to conditionally fetch `MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA` using `userService.get` when `msSelectedComps` includes "Media Impact Score Chart". If not included, `mediaImpactGraphData` is reset. The `transformMediaImpactData` function was updated to process the fetched data dynamically, and the `Media Impact Score` chart's rendering now depends on `msSelectedComps` and `loading` states. This marks a shift from static dummy data to dynamic data fetching for at least one chart.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:58:07 PM**: No significant functional changes.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:58:28 PM**: `MediaScoreReport` component started receiving `msMentionCountMediaTypes` prop, and a `console.log` was added for debugging it.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:02:13 PM - 05:09:52 PM**: Portions of the code were commented out and re-enabled, suggesting active development and testing of components, particularly regarding data fetching logic.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:10:57 PM**: Imported `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA` from `@/constants`. The `useEffect` logic was updated to also fetch `Media Mention Count` data when `msSelectedComps` includes it, calling a new `fetchMediaMentionCountData` function.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:12:35 PM**: Added `mediaMentionCountData` state and updated the `useEffect` to fetch `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA` using a `userService.post` request with `selectedMediaTypes` (which is not yet defined in the snippet, likely `msMentionCountMediaTypes`).
    *   **Timestamp: 05:13:34 PM**: Corrected the `userService.post` call for `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA` to use `msMentionCountMediaTypes`. Added error handling for `fetchMediaMentionCountData`.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:14:21 PM**: Declared a `media` state variable without initialization, which was quickly removed.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:16:04 PM**: Implemented `transformMediaMentionCountData` to prepare data for the "Media Mention Count" stacked bar chart and updated the chart's rendering to depend on `msSelectedComps` and fetched `mediaMentionCountData`.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:20:16 PM - 05:25:16 PM**: Large sections of the code were commented out in `MediaScore.jsx`, then re-enabled, indicating a testing or refactoring phase.
    *   **Timestamp: 05:26:41 PM**: Implemented conditional rendering for the "Media Impact Score" and "Media Mention Count" sections based on whether their respective component names are present in `msSelectedComps`. This is crucial for dynamic report generation.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10:50:28 AM**: Removed previously commented-out `companyNarratives` and `competitorNarratives` dummy data sections, simplifying the component to focus on performance metrics and comparative analysis. Adjusted `min-h-[841px]` to `min-h-[841px]` and changed `mb-4` to `mb-2` for performance metrics section.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:50:53 AM**: Changed `min-h-[841px]` to `min-h-[841px]` for the main section.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:51:19 AM**: Removed `min-h-[841px]` from the main `section` tag.
    *   **Timestamp: 10:51:35 AM**: Reverted `min-h-[841px]` for the main `section` tag.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10:51:46 AM**: No major functional changes, but minor styling adjustments were made to the main `section` tag (`w-1/2` and `min-h-[841px]`).
    *   **Timestamp: 10:52:20 AM**: Reverted the `width` property on the main `section` tag to `w-1/2` and added `min-h-[841px]`.

5.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11:21:02 AM**: Initial creation of `SpokePersonReport` component as a placeholder.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:28:53 AM**: Expanded `SpokePersonReport` with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), dynamic imports for charts (`react-apexcharts`, `react-d3-speedometer`), service calls (`userService`), and local storage (`useLocalStorage`, `useNotification`). It introduced fetching data for spokesperson mentions, sentiment, and monthly mention graphs, and includes UI elements like a brand header, date range filters, speedometer, sentiment bar chart, and a table of top spokespersons. Dummy `ATTACH_URL` was present.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:29:44 AM**: Corrected string concatenation for `ATTACH_URL` by removing an extra `+` sign.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:32:21 AM**: Removed dynamic data fetching logic (API calls, `useState`, `useEffect` for data management) and replaced it with inline dummy data for `spokespersonMentions`, `mentionGraphData`, `noOfMentionsData`, `sentimentScore`, and `sentimentData`. The chart configurations (`monthlyChartData`, `sentimentChartData`) were also updated to use this dummy data. The overall layout and styling were adjusted to match the other report components (e.g., `w-1/2`, `min-h-[841px]`, `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `p-6`). The horizontal bar chart was changed to vertical with updated `xaxis` categories.
    *   **Timestamp: 11:37:04 AM**: Reverted the horizontal bar chart for monthly mentions back to horizontal (`plotOptions.bar.horizontal: true`) and adjusted chart height to `180px` (from `300px`). Added more dummy data points for September and October to `mentionGraphData`. Updated `xaxis` and `yaxis` label styles and colors to black. Adjusted `maxSegmentLabels` for `ReactSpeedometer` to `0`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:17:13 PM**: Renamed dummy data variables (e.g., `spokespersonMentions` to `dummySpokespersonMentions`) and updated the component to use these new names. Minor adjustments to the speedometer's `width` and `ringWidth` properties.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:17:51 PM - 12:29:31 PM**: Minor revisions to dummy data naming conventions and chart configurations. The horizontal bar chart for monthly mentions was briefly changed to vertical and then reverted back to horizontal, with minor adjustments to `xaxis` categories. It appears to be experimenting with chart orientation.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:25:25 PM**: The entire content of the file was commented out, likely for a temporary disabling or a large-scale refactoring/testing phase.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:25:48 PM - 12:27:39 PM**: The previously commented-out code was uncommented and reactivated, with some minor adjustments to the dummy `mentionGraphData` (reducing the number of months).

6.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12:29:51 PM**: Initial creation of `CatelogReport` component as a placeholder.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:34:23 PM**: Expanded `CatelogReport` to display a list of dummy articles with website, title, summary, URL, publish date, and sentiment. It includes an `ArticleCard` sub-component for rendering each article. Basic layout and styling using Tailwind CSS classes (`w-1/2`, `min-h-[841px]`, `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `p-6`). Placeholder UI for date filters and outlet tags is included, along with disabled pagination.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:35:21 PM**: Removed the date filter placeholder HTML elements, indicating a decision to simplify the UI or implement them differently later.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:35:32 PM**: Removed the "Pagination UI disabled" section.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:37:19 PM**: Changed the `div` containing articles to not have `shadow-[0px_2px_4px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]` and removed `max-h-[640px]` from the containing div, then re-added it with `shadow-[0px_2px_4px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]`. Also adjusted the pagination text.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:37:48 PM**: Removed the pagination section completely.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:38:30 PM**: Removed `rounded-md shadow-[0px_2px_4px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]` from the `div` containing the articles.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:38:47 PM**: Removed `max-h-[640px]` from the `div` containing the articles list.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:39:04 PM**: Re-added `rounded-md` and `max-h-[640px]` to the `div` containing the articles list.
    *   **Timestamp: 12:39:16 PM**: Changed `rounded-md` to `rounded-xl` for the div containing the articles.
    *   **Timestamp: 01:26:06 PM - 01:26:27 PM**: Removed one dummy article entry from the `dummyArticles` array, reducing the number of displayed articles.

7.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\GenerateReport\GenerateReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04:10:07 PM**: Introduced a new `GenerateReport` component, responsible for configuring and triggering report generation. It uses local storage (`useLocalStorage`), custom hooks (`useBrandMediaTypes`, `useNotification`), and defines multiple state variables for managing selected components and date ranges across different report sections (Media Score, Sentiment, Share of Voice, Spokesperson, Catalog). It includes `DropdownComponent` and `MultiSelectDropdown` for UI. A `handleSelectAllDD` function is present to select all sub-components within each report category.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:10:34 PM**: No significant functional changes; minor formatting.
    *   **Timestamp: 04:26:03 PM**: No significant functional changes; minor formatting.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **PDF Generation Focus**: The most prominent pattern is the continuous refinement of PDF generation logic in `Report.jsx` using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas(-pro)`. This includes handling styling issues during conversion (`applyStyle`, `removeStyle`), iterating through sections for multi-page PDFs, and adding clickable links.
*   **Dummy Data Usage**: Many components initially use or revert to dummy data (`MediaScore.jsx`, `Sentiment.jsx`, `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`, `SpokePersonReport.jsx`, `CatelogReport.jsx`). This suggests that the front-end development is often decoupled from the backend, allowing UI/UX to be built and tested independently.
*   **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `p-6`, `rounded-xl`, `flex`, `grid`, `text-sm`, `font-bold`) across all report components for visual presentation and layout.
*   **Dynamic Charting**: Heavy reliance on `react-apexcharts` for data visualization (pie, line, bar charts). Charts often have customized options for height, colors, legends, axis styles, and data labels.
*   **Conditional Rendering**: The introduction of `msSelectedComps` and other `*SelectedComps` props to `Report.jsx` and subsequent passing to sub-components (`MediaScore.jsx`) indicates a move towards dynamic, customizable report generation, where sections are rendered based on user selection.
*   **Data Fetching (Initial & Reversion)**: `SpokePersonReport.jsx` initially had dynamic data fetching logic with `useEffect` and `userService` calls but then reverted to dummy data, likely to simplify testing or work on UI independently. `MediaScore.jsx` later re-introduced and expanded dynamic data fetching for its charts.
*   **Report Structure**: Each report component (e.g., `MediaScoreReport`, `SentimentReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`) follows a similar structural pattern: a header, followed by multiple sections/cards displaying key metrics, tables, and charts. Each section is wrapped in a `pdf-section` class for PDF generation.
*   **Debugging**: Frequent use of `console.log` statements (e.g., in `Report.jsx` and `MediaScore.jsx`) suggests active debugging of prop passing and data flow during development.

## 11:12:18 AM
The log details changes across three files, primarily focusing on report generation and data visualization within a React-based frontend application.

### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`

This file, responsible for the main Brand Report component, underwent several UI adjustments and a significant structural change.

*   **11/24/2025, 10:54:54 AM - 10:58:58 AM**: Initial changes focused on adjusting the layout and styling of the main `Report` component. The `div` wrapping the report sections (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`) was modified, initially introducing a `pdfRef` prop (later removed) and `w-[800px]` for centering, followed by several iterations adjusting `className` attributes like `mx-auto p-10`, `flex flex-col items-center`, `justify-center`, and `text-center` to refine its positioning and responsiveness.
*   **11/24/2025, 10:59:10 AM - 10:59:37 AM**: The "Download Report" button was temporarily commented out, then the surrounding `div`'s classes were further refined to be `flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-center`, impacting the overall alignment.
*   **11/24/2025, 11:00:07 AM**: The "Download Report" button was restored and some `div` classes were simplified to `mx-auto p-10 items-center`.
*   **11/24/2025, 11:29:09 AM**: A new component, `SpokePersonReport`, was imported and integrated into the report structure, indicating an expansion of the data reports available.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:34:48 PM**: Another new component, `CatelogReport`, was imported and added to the report structure, further expanding the report's functionality.
*   **11/24/2025, 04:26:55 PM - 11/25/2025, 10:22:47 AM**: The `Report` functional component was updated to accept several props: `msSelectedComps`, `sentiSelectedComps`, `sovSelectedComps`, `spokesSelectedComps`, and `catalogSelectedComps`. Subsequently, `msMentionCountMediaTypes`, `msImpactScorePeriod`, and `msImpactScoreMediaTypes` were added to the props, and these props were then passed down to the `MediaScore` component. This indicates a shift towards dynamic report generation based on user selections. Debugging `console.log` statements were also added and removed to inspect the `msSelectedComps`, `msImpactScorePeriod`, and `msImpactScoreMediaTypes` props.

### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`

This file was newly created and significantly evolved to display spokesperson-related data.

*   **11/24/2025, 11:21:02 AM**: Initial creation as a basic placeholder `SpokePersonReport` component.
*   **11/24/2025, 11:28:53 AM**: The component was heavily developed to fetch and display various spokesperson metrics:
    *   Imports for `useState`, `useEffect`, `dynamic` (for `next/dynamic`), `userService`, `constants` (SPOKESPERSON\_MENTIONS, SPOKESPERSON\_SENTIMENT\_CHART, SPOKESPERSON\_NO\_OF\_MENTIONS), `useLocalStorage`, `useNotification`, `noUser` asset, and `RxCross2` icon.
    *   State variables were introduced for `dateRange`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `dateStatus`, `spokespersonMentions`, `isLoadingSpokesperson`, `sentimentScore`, `sentimentData`, `mentionGraphData`, and `noOfMentionsData`.
    *   `useEffect` hooks were added to fetch data for mentions, sentiment, monthly mentions graph, and number of mentions using `userService` based on date range.
    *   Chart data configurations (`sentimentChartData`, `monthlyChartData`) were defined using `react-apexcharts` and `react-d3-speedometer`.
    *   The UI structure was created to display brand logo and name, spokesperson mention count (bar chart), number of mentions (with speedometer), spokesperson sentiment score (bar chart), and top 5 spokesperson mentions (table).
*   **11/24/2025, 11:32:21 AM**: The component was refactored to use static "dummy data" instead of API calls and dynamic date range selection. Imports related to `userService`, `constants`, `useLocalStorage`, and `useNotification` were removed, along with all state management (`useState`, `useEffect`) and date handling logic. Chart types and display properties were adjusted (e.g., monthly chart height, speedometer ring width). The overall layout was updated with more specific Tailwind CSS classes (`w-1/2`, `min-h-[841px]`, `bg-[#f5f5f5]`).
*   **11/24/2025, 11:37:04 AM - 12:29:31 PM**: Further styling and layout refinements were applied, particularly to the chart components and table.
    *   `Chart` import changed to `ReactApexChart`.
    *   Monthly chart `plotOptions.bar.horizontal` was changed from `true` to `false` (vertical bars), then back to `true` (horizontal bars) in later commits.
    *   Colors in `monthlyChartData.options.colors` were updated multiple times (`#357AF6`, `#5CC8BE`, `#EFCD94` to `#6366F1`, `#06B6D4`, `#FB923C` and back).
    *   Minor adjustments to font sizes, padding, and border styles (`border-black/15`, `bg-[#F7F7F7]`, `bg-[#F2F5FA]`).
    *   The structure was refined to use `flex justify-between flex-col w-1/2 min-h-[841px] bg-[#f5f5f5] p-6` for the main section, and `div` wrappers with specific styling for each report section.
    *   In a commit at `12:23:00 PM`, the `monthlyChartData` was briefly configured for vertical bars (`horizontal: false`) and referenced a non-existent `graphData` state variable, which was quickly corrected to use `dummyMentionGraphData` and revert to `horizontal: true` in subsequent commits.
    *   The number of `dummyMentionGraphData` entries was reduced from 6 to 3 in a commit at `12:27:04 PM`.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:25:25 PM**: The entire content of the file was commented out, effectively disabling the component.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:25:48 PM - 12:29:31 PM**: The component's code was uncommented and then further refined, including reverting `monthlyChartData` to horizontal bars and reducing the `dummyMentionGraphData` array size.

### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`

This file was introduced and developed to display a catalog of articles.

*   **11/24/2025, 12:29:51 PM**: Initial creation as a basic placeholder `CatelogReport` component.
*   **11/24/2025, 12:34:23 PM**: The component was significantly updated to include:
    *   `dummyArticles` data structure.
    *   An `ArticleCard` sub-component for rendering individual articles.
    *   A `CatelogReport` component displaying a "Catalog Report" header.
    *   A scrollable container for articles with dummy date filters and outlet tags (disabled functionality).
    *   Rendering of `dummyArticles` using `ArticleCard`.
    *   A placeholder for pagination info.
    *   Initial styling for the report section (`w-1/2 min-h-[841px] bg-[#f5f5f5] p-6 rounded-lg`) and the content wrapper (`border border-black/15 rounded-md shadow-[0px_2px_4px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)] p-5`).
*   **11/24/2025, 12:35:21 PM - 12:39:16 PM**: Minor cosmetic and structural changes:
    *   Removal of disabled date filter inputs at `12:35:21 PM`.
    *   Removal of the pagination section briefly at `12:35:32 PM`, then re-added with a different message ("Pagination disabled for export") at `12:37:19 PM`.
    *   Adjustments to the shadow class and border of the main content `div` (e.g., removing `shadow-[0px_2px_4px_0px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]` at `12:37:48 PM`, changing `rounded-md` to `rounded-xl` at `12:39:16 PM`).
    *   The `min-h-[841px]` was removed from the section element at `1:26:27 PM`.
*   **11/24/2025, 01:26:06 PM - 01:26:27 PM**: `dummyArticles` array was slightly reduced in length.

### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`

This file was heavily refactored to support dynamic data fetching based on user selections.

*   **11/24/2025, 01:33:48 PM**: Initial implementation as `MediaScoreReport` with static dummy data for media impact score, competitor ranking, quality of mentions, and two chart data sets (`mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionData`). It used `react-apexcharts` for pie, line, and bar charts.
*   **11/24/2025, 04:05:32 PM**: No significant functional changes, only content rearrangement.
*   **11/24/2025, 04:37:31 PM - 04:56:07 PM**: The component was updated to accept `msSelectedComps` as a prop.
    *   `useState` and `useEffect` hooks were introduced for `mediaImpactGraphData` and `loading`.
    *   API calls via `userService.get(MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA)` were added inside `useEffect` to fetch `mediaImpactGraphData` dynamically, contingent on `msSelectedComps` including "Media Impact Score Chart". If not selected, the state is cleared.
    *   The rendering of the "Media Impact Score" chart became conditional on `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Impact Score Chart")` and `impactSeries.length > 0`.
    *   Initial `console.log` statements (`console.log("aaa", msSelectedComps)`) were added for debugging the passed props.
*   **11/24/2025, 04:58:28 PM - 05:16:04 PM**: Further enhancements to dynamic data fetching were implemented.
    *   The `msMentionCountMediaTypes` prop was added.
    *   A new state `mediaMentionCountData` was introduced.
    *   A second `fetchMediaMentionCountData` async function was added in the `useEffect` to call `userService.post(MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA)` based on `msMentionCountMediaTypes`, triggered if `msSelectedComps` includes "Media Mention Count".
    *   The rendering of the "Media Mention Count" chart became conditional on `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Mention Count")` and `mediaMentionCountData.length`.
    *   `console.log("media", msMentionCountMediaTypes)` was added for debugging.
*   **11/24/2025, 05:20:16 PM - 05:35:33 PM**: The entire component code was commented out. This was likely for testing or temporary deactivation.
*   **11/24/2025, 05:36:42 PM**: The component code was uncommented. The conditional rendering logic for `Media Impact Score Chart` and `Media Mention Count` was wrapped in `msSelectedComps.includes()` checks, ensuring only selected sections are rendered. `null` was added as a fallback for conditional rendering.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:23:03 AM - 10:25:09 AM**: `msImpactScorePeriod` and `msImpactScoreMediaTypes` props were added. The `useEffect` hook was updated to include an additional condition for fetching data related to "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)". A new constant `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE` was imported.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:25:40 AM**: `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS` constant was imported.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:28:21 AM**: `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH` constant was imported.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:09:19 AM - 11:09:42 AM**: The component was further developed to fetch data for "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" using three separate API calls (`GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS`, `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH`) and manage corresponding states (`brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`). The rendering of the "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" block, including its score, change percent, ranking table, and quality of mentions pie chart, became conditional based on `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Impact Score (Previous Months)")`. Dynamic values were integrated into the display elements.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:01:45 AM - 11:07:45 AM**: The entire component's code was commented out again, indicating another period of temporary deactivation or a major refactoring in progress.

### General Observations and Patterns:

*   **Date Range Handling**: The `handleDateRangeChange` function is a recurring utility, calculating `startDate` and `endDate` based on predefined ranges ("Past 24 hours", "Last 3 days", "Last 1 week", "Last 1 month", "Last 6 months", "Custom Date Range"). This pattern appears in initial `SpokePersonReport` and `GenerateReport`.
*   **Dynamic Imports**: Both `SpokePersonReport` and `MediaScore` extensively use `next/dynamic` for importing charting libraries (`react-apexcharts`, `react-d3-speedometer`) with `ssr: false`, indicating a client-side rendering approach for these interactive components.
*   **PDF Generation Logic**: The `Report.jsx` file consistently implements a PDF generation mechanism using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro`. This logic applies a temporary CSS style (`pdf-style-fix`) to ensure proper rendering of images and SVGs before capturing sections of the DOM, then removes the style. This process involves iterating through elements with the class `.pdf-section`, converting them to canvas images, adding them as pages to a PDF, and preserving clickable links.
*   **Component Structure**: There's a clear pattern of breaking down larger report functionalities (Media Score, Sentiment, Share of Voice, Spokesperson, Catalog) into separate, reusable React components, which are then assembled in the main `Report.jsx`.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes are heavily used across all updated components for styling and layout (`bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `rounded-xl`, `p-4`, `flex justify-between flex-col`, `grid grid-cols-2 gap-4`, etc.).
*   **Data Fetching**: The `MediaScoreReport` component (and initially `SpokePersonReport`) transitioned from using hardcoded dummy data to dynamic data fetching via `userService` and `useEffect` hooks, indicating a move towards a data-driven UI. There is also a pattern of clearing data states if a component/chart is not selected for display.
*   **Conditional Rendering**: `MediaScoreReport` specifically uses `msSelectedComps.includes()` checks to conditionally render different sections of the report (e.g., "Media Impact Score Chart", "Media Mention Count", "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)"), suggesting a customizable report generation feature.
*   **Debugging**: The presence of `console.log` statements in `Report.jsx` and `MediaScore.jsx` indicates active debugging during development, particularly when passing new props to child components.
*   **Timestamp Consistency**: All changes fall within a single day, `11/24/2025` to `11/25/2025`, suggesting intensive development or refactoring work on these report components over a short period. The dates are in the future, which might be a typo in the log or a placeholder.

## 12:12:15 PM
The changes primarily involve two files: `MediaScore.jsx` and `Report.jsx`, both located under `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\`. There's also one update to an `.env` file, which will be omitted from the summary as per instructions.

### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`

**Key Updates & Timestamps:**

*   **11/24/2025, 4:46:08 PM:** Initial version of `MediaScore.jsx` is a React component displaying various media-related reports (Media Impact Score, Competitor Ranking, Quality of Mentions, Media Mention Count). It uses `next/dynamic` for `ReactApexChart` and initializes with hardcoded dummy data for all sections and charts.
*   **11/24/2025, 4:46:46 PM:** A `userService` import from `@/Services/user.service` is added, hinting at future API integration. No immediate usage is visible.
*   **11/24/2025, 4:53:47 PM:** Significant refactoring begins.
    *   `React.useState` and `React.useEffect` hooks are imported.
    *   State variables `mediaImpactGraphData` and `loading` are introduced to manage dynamic data fetching.
    *   A `useEffect` hook is added to `fetchMediaImpactGraphData` asynchronously using `userService.get(MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA)`. This fetch is conditionally executed if `msSelectedComps` includes "Media Impact Score Chart".
    *   The `mediaImpactGraphData` dummy data is replaced with state management.
    *   Logic for displaying "Loading graph data..." or "No data to display" is introduced for the Media Impact Score chart.
    *   The `transformMediaImpactData` function is updated to process potentially dynamic `mediaImpactGraphData`.
*   **11/24/2025, 5:10:57 PM:** The `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA` constant is imported, indicating plans to fetch data for the "Media Mention Count" chart dynamically. The `useEffect` logic is updated to check for `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Impact Score Chart")` twice, which appears to be a redundant condition.
*   **11/24/2025, 5:12:35 PM - 11/24/2025, 5:13:34 PM:** A new `fetchMediaMentionCountData` async function is added. It uses `userService.post(MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA)` and a `selectedMediaTypes` variable (which is not yet defined, causing a potential issue). The `useEffect` is updated to call this new fetch function if "Media Mention Count" is included in `msSelectedComps`, but it incorrectly sets `mediaImpactGraphData` instead of a dedicated state for mention count data.
*   **11/24/2025, 5:14:21 PM:** A new state variable `media` is declared but commented out and immediately re-removed. This was likely a temporary attempt to introduce new state.
*   **11/24/2025, 5:16:04 PM:** A dedicated state variable `mediaMentionCountData` is correctly introduced, and the `fetchMediaMentionCountData` function is updated to populate it. The `media` parameter for `userService.post` is correctly changed to `msMentionCountMediaTypes`. A new `transformMediaMentionCountData` function is also added to process this new data.
*   **11/24/2025, 5:26:41 PM:** The `useEffect` hook is further refined to handle both `mediaImpactGraphData` and `mediaMentionCountData` fetching independently based on `msSelectedComps`. The dependency array is updated to include `msSelectedComps` and `msMentionCountMediaTypes`. The hardcoded `mediaMentionData` is removed, implying it will now be sourced dynamically. Display logic for "Media Impact Score Chart" and "Media Mention Count" is made conditional based on `msSelectedComps` and data availability.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:23:03 AM:** `msImpactScorePeriod` prop is added to `MediaScoreReport`.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:23:24 AM:** `msImpactScoreMediaTypes` prop is added to `MediaScoreReport`.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:25:09 AM:** New constants `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE` is imported.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:25:40 AM:** `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS` constant is imported.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:28:21 AM:** `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH` constant is imported. The `useEffect` now includes a new conditional block for "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" to fetch data using `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS`, and `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH`. Dummy data for `mediaImpactScore`, `competitorRanking`, and `qualityOfMentions` is still present, but the intention is to replace it.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:09:19 AM:** The dummy `mediaImpactScore`, `competitorRanking`, and `qualityOfMentions` are replaced with state variables (`brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`). The `useEffect` is updated to correctly fetch and set these states using the newly imported API endpoints when "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" is selected. Error handling and `finally` blocks are also refined.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:30:49 AM:** Significant changes:
    *   The component is renamed from `MediaScoreReport` to `MediaScore`.
    *   State management (`useState`, `useEffect`) and API calls are moved from `MediaScore` to the parent `Report` component (as seen in `Report.jsx` changes). This `MediaScore` component now receives its data (`mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`, `brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`) and `loading` status as props.
    *   The internal hardcoded data (`mediaImpactScore`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`, `mediaMentionData`) is removed.
    *   The `qualityPieChartData` now uses `qualityOfMentions` from props and correctly maps `typeOfMention`.
    *   The structure of rendering based on `msSelectedComps` is updated to use the incoming props.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:37:10 AM - 11/25/2025, 11:41:40 AM:** Introduce a new `lineChartData` definition and associated `months`, `categories`, `groupedByBrand`, and `series` variables, which appear to be for `mediaArticleCountData`. This suggests adding a new chart type. However, it's initially rendered for "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" which seems like a misplacement. There are some naming conflicts with existing `series` and `categories` variables (`impactSeries`, `impactCategories`).
*   **11/25/2025, 11:49:50 AM:** Corrected the `lineChartData` to use `mediaArticleCountData` specifically, indicating a new "Media Article Count" chart. The `months` and `categories` variables for this chart are now explicitly derived from `mediaArticleCountData`.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:52:14 AM - 11/25/2025, 11:58:55 AM:** Minor styling and chart height adjustments (e.g., `height={400}` to `height={240}` for `lineChartData`, `text-[8px]` to `text-[10px]`, `text-[13px]`, `text-[14px]` for table headers/rows, pie chart height from `220` to `180`/`190`). The previous redundant `lineChartData` rendering is removed, and the "Media Article Count" is now correctly conditionally rendered if `msSelectedComps` includes "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" (which is a logical error, it should be "Media Article Count").
*   **11/25/2025, 12:00:33 PM:** Adjusted `plotOptions.pie.donut` size to "50%" and added `dataLabels.offset: -15` to the pie chart, improving its appearance.
*   **11/25/2025, 12:01:19 PM:** Corrected the title of the first chart from "Media Impact Score Report" to "Media Score". Still, the conditional rendering for "Media Article Count" remains `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Impact Score (Previous Months)")` which is incorrect.

### `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`

**Key Updates & Timestamps:**

*   **11/24/2025, 4:57:50 PM:** Initial version of `Report.jsx`. It imports `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`. It defines a `downloadPDFWithLinks` function using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro` to capture sections and create a PDF. The `MediaScore` component is rendered with `msSelectedComps` prop.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:20:13 AM:** Adds `msImpactScorePeriod` prop to the `Report` component.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:21:04 AM:** Adds `msImpactScoreMediaTypes` prop to the `Report` component.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:22:47 AM:** Passes the new `msImpactScorePeriod` and `msImpactScoreMediaTypes` props to the `MediaScore` component.
*   **11/25/2025, 10:37:09 AM:** Adds console logs to track `msImpactScorePeriod` and `msImpactScoreMediaTypes`.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:16:58 AM:** Major refactor.
    *   Imports `useState`, `useEffect`, `userService`, and several API constants (`GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS`, `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH`).
    *   Moves all state management for media reports (`mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`, `brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`, `loading`) from `MediaScore.jsx` to `Report.jsx`.
    *   Extracts the API fetching logic into separate functions (`fetchMediaImpactGraphData`, `fetchMediaMentionCountData`, `fetchBrandImpactAndRelated`).
    *   The `useEffect` in `Report.jsx` now conditionally calls these fetch functions based on `msSelectedComps` and passes the fetched data directly as props to `MediaScore`.
    *   The `MediaScore` component is now conditionally rendered only if `msSelectedComps.length > 0`.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:42:33 AM:** Imports `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT` constant. Adds a new `loadMediaArticleCount` function and state variable `mediaArticleCountData` to handle fetching and storing data for media article counts. The `useEffect` logic now checks for "Media Article Count" in `msSelectedComps` and calls the new load function. (Note: there's a redundant `loadMediaMentionCountData` call here which is fixed in the next step).
*   **11/25/2025, 11:42:51 AM:** Removes the redundant `load` function (which was a duplicate of `loadMediaMentionCountData`) and fixes the call related to `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT`.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:45:01 AM:** Adds a new prop `msMediaArticleMediaTypes` to the `Report` component and passes it to the `loadMediaArticleCount` function. Updates the `useEffect` dependency array.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:45:36 AM:** A temporary `mediaA` state variable is declared and then removed in this commit, indicating an intermediate change.
*   **11/25/2025, 11:47:44 AM:** The `loadMediaArticleCount` function is now correctly triggered if `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Article Count")`. There was a previous logical error triggering it with "Media Impact Score Chart". Also, `msMediaArticleMediaTypes` is added to the `useEffect` dependency array.
*   **11/25/2025, 12:06:33 PM:** Imports additional constants: `GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_NO_OF_MENTIONS`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`.
*   **11/25/2025, 12:08:13 PM:** Adds `msPerformanceMetricPeriod` prop to `Report` component. Introduces a new `loadPerformanceMatrix` function to fetch data for "Performance Metrics" but it incorrectly reuses `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT` and `setMediaArticleCountData`.
*   **11/25/2025, 12:09:06 PM:** Corrects the condition for `loadPerformanceMatrix` to be `msSelectedComps.includes("Performance Metrics")`. The `loadMediaArticleCount` is still duplicated under two separate `if` conditions, which is inefficient.
*   **11/25/2025, 12:10:26 PM:** A blank array declaration `const []` is added, then removed, indicating a minor, quickly reverted change.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Conditional Rendering and Data Fetching:** Both components heavily utilize conditional logic (`msSelectedComps.includes(...)`) to determine which sections of the report to render and which API calls to make. This suggests a configurable reporting system where users can select which report components they want to see.
*   **API Integration:** There's a clear move from hardcoded dummy data to dynamic data fetching using a `userService` and various API endpoints (`MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA`, `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS`, `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH`, `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT`).
*   **State Management in Parent Component:** A significant architectural change occurred around 11/25/2025, 11:16:58 AM, where the core state and data fetching logic were migrated from `MediaScore.jsx` (a child component) to `Report.jsx` (a parent component). This centralizes data management and allows the `MediaScore` component to be a more "presentational" component, receiving data as props.
*   **Chart Visualization:** `ReactApexChart` is consistently used for rendering various types of charts (pie, line, bar) throughout the `MediaScore` component. Chart options (colors, legends, tooltips, axis styles) are extensively configured.
*   **Data Transformation:** Functions like `transformMediaImpactData` and `transformMediaMentionCountData` are consistently used to massage raw API data into the format required by `ReactApexChart`.
*   **PDF Generation:** The `Report.jsx` component includes functionality to download the entire report as a PDF using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`, including styling fixes for image/SVG rendering.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `bg-white`, `rounded-xl`, `p-4`, `flex`, `text-sm`, `font-semibold`) are used for consistent styling across the report sections.
*   **Prop-Drilling:** As state management moves to `Report.jsx`, several props are passed down to `MediaScore.jsx` (e.g., `mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`, `brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`).
*   **Typographical Errors:** A recurring typo "Media Aricle Count" instead of "Media Article Count" appears in the HTML heading for one of the charts in `MediaScore.jsx`.

## 1:06:10 PM
The changes log for the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail.html` indicates a series of iterative updates to an HTML email template for a "Skribe Paid PR Service - VIP Bundle Upgrade" campaign.

**File-Specific Updates & Timestamps:**

*   **11/25/2025, 12:51:53 PM:** The initial log entry details a promotional email template. It includes a header with the Skribe logo and service name, a personalized greeting (`$$Client Name/First Name$$`), an introduction to the "Skribe Bundle campaign," a section titled "The Real Cost of Waiting" with a two-row pricing comparison table, a "Last Call for the Strategy Session" section, and a call-to-action (CTA) button to "Lock In My 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session." The content implies further email body existed.
*   **11/25/2025, 12:52:11 PM:** A minor update removed a `... (rest of the original mailer content continues unchanged)` placeholder, suggesting this entry is a complete snapshot of the file at this point.
*   **11/25/2025, 12:56:27 PM:** New content was added: a paragraph about analyzing user patterns for savings, a new section with a stylized heading "The VIP Cost-Per-PR", an introductory paragraph for a "4-week offer," and a new "VIP Pricing Table" started to be defined (though the log entry for this timestamp was truncated mid-table).
*   **11/25/2025, 12:57:59 PM:** A significant change occurred where the file content was entirely cleared, resulting in an empty HTML file.
*   **11/25/2025, 12:58:07 PM:** The email content was largely restored and significantly restructured. The placeholder for the client name was simplified from `$$Client Name/First Name$$` to `Client Name/First Name`. The initial "The Real Cost of Waiting" section and its pricing table were removed. The "VIP Cost-Per-PR" section (from 12:56:27 PM) was fully implemented with new pricing details (per-PR cost and total savings for 10-PR bundles). An "Upgrade Bonus: An Exclusive Add-On" section was added, offering a "Free 1-Hour Strategy Session" and indicating it "disappears next week!". A new CTA button "Upgrade to 6 or 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session" was introduced, along with closing remarks and a comprehensive footer including social media links and an unsubscribe link.
*   **11/25/2025, 12:58:32 PM - 1:04:58 PM (and subsequent identical entries):** This period saw rapid, incremental adjustments, primarily focused on refining the marketing message and correcting inconsistencies:
    *   Several introductory paragraphs were re-inserted and repositioned, causing some temporary redundancy in the messaging regarding bundle urgency.
    *   The `<h3>` title for the "VIP Cost-Per-PR" section was changed to "The Real Cost of Waiting."
    *   The *original* "The Real Cost of Waiting" `<h3>` and its two-row pricing table were re-inserted, leading to the temporary presence of two distinct "The Real Cost of Waiting" sections with different table structures and data.
    *   The CTA button text was rephrased to "Lock In My 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session."
    *   The "Upgrade Bonus" section's `<h3>` title was changed to "Last Call for the Strategy Session," creating another instance of a duplicated section title.
    *   The descriptive text for the strategy session bonus was refined, explicitly reminding users about its validity.
    *   Crucially, the pricing data and column headers within the *second* pricing table (the one initially introduced as "VIP Pricing Table") were extensively revised and corrected to align with the values and structure of the *first* pricing table, consolidating the pricing message. For example, specific values for "ANI + PTI + 250" and "ANI + BS + PTI + 250" bundle prices and cost of singles were updated to match, and column headers like "Price Per PR in 10-PR Bundle" were changed to "Cost of 10 Singles (Next Month)" to ensure consistency.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Promotional Focus:** The entire file consistently serves as a promotional email for Skribe's paid PR service bundles, emphasizing discounts and bonuses for early commitment.
*   **Urgency:** Phrases like "final stages," "ends next week," "Last Call," and "This bonus disappears next week!" are frequently used to create a sense of urgency.
*   **Pricing Comparison:** Multiple attempts were made to present a clear financial comparison between purchasing bundles versus single PR services, highlighting significant savings. This involved introducing, removing, and then reconciling two different table structures and their data.
*   **Bonus Offer:** A "Free 1-Hour Strategy Session" is consistently highlighted as an incentive for bundle purchases.
*   **Brand Elements:** The Skribe logo, company name, service tagline, and social media links remain consistent throughout the changes.
*   **Dynamic Content:** The `Client Name/First Name` placeholder indicates the email is intended for personalization.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The log shows a clear pattern of continuous refinement, where content blocks were added, removed, moved, and modified in quick succession, particularly in the core persuasive sections (pricing and bonus offers), to hone the marketing message. There was a notable point of complete content deletion and subsequent re-creation, indicating a major rewrite or reset in the development process.

## 1:12:16 PM
The provided log details changes across two files: `MediaScore.jsx` and `Report.jsx`, both located in `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\`. There is also an entry for an `.env` file, but its content will not be summarized as per instructions.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**

*   **Initial State (11/24/2025, 5:14:21 PM):** The component initializes several state variables (`mediaImpactGraphData`, `loading`) and defines static data for `mediaImpactScore`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`, and `mediaMentionData`. It includes `useEffect` hooks to fetch `MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA` and `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA` based on `msSelectedComps`. It renders a "Media Score Report" section with a Media Impact Score card (including competitor ranking and quality of mentions pie chart), a Media Impact Score line chart, and a Media Mention Count bar chart, using `ReactApexChart` for visualizations.
*   **Minor Refinement (11/24/2025, 5:16:04 PM):** A new state variable `mediaMentionCountData` is added, replacing a placeholder `media` state, and used to store the fetched data for "Media Mention Count". The `fetchMediaMentionCountData` now correctly updates `setMediaMentionCountData`.
*   **Commented Out Code (11/24/2025, 5:20:16 PM - 5:25:16 PM):** The entire file content is commented out, suggesting a temporary disablement or a large-scale refactor in progress.
*   **Re-enabled and Logic Refinement (11/24/2025, 5:26:41 PM):** The code is uncommented. The `useEffect` logic is updated to handle `msSelectedComps` for "Media Impact Score Chart" and "Media Mention Count" independently, setting respective state data to empty arrays if a component is not selected. The `msMentionCountMediaTypes` is now correctly passed to the `fetchMediaMentionCountData` API call. The `mediaMentionData` static variable is removed, and a `transformMediaMentionCountData` function is introduced to process `mediaMentionCountData` into chart-compatible format dynamically.
*   **Commented Out Again (11/25/2025, 10:34:42 AM - 11:07:45 AM):** Similar to previous comments, the file is temporarily commented out.
*   **Major Refactor and Data Integration (11/25/2025, 11:09:19 AM):**
    *   The `MediaScoreReport` component is renamed to `MediaScore`.
    *   New props `msImpactScorePeriod` and `msImpactScoreMediaTypes` are added to handle dynamic data fetching for "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)".
    *   New state variables are introduced: `brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`, and `loading` is now a single source of truth for loading state across all fetches.
    *   The `useEffect` hook is significantly updated to:
        *   Remove static data (`mediaImpactScore`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions` arrays) and replace them with dynamic state variables initialized from API calls.
        *   Fetch data for `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS`, and `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH` when "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" is selected, using `Promise.all` for concurrent fetching.
        *   Update the `qualityPieChartData` to use `qualityOfMentions` from state and adapt to its structure (`typeOfMention`).
    *   The JSX rendering logic is updated to conditionally display the "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" block, using `brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, and `qualityOfMentions` from state.
*   **Minor Adjustments (11/25/2025, 11:30:49 AM):**
    *   The `MediaScore` component now receives data as props instead of fetching it internally (`mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`, `brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`). This indicates a shift in responsibility for data fetching to the parent `Report` component.
    *   A `lineChartData` definition is added, seemingly intended for `mediaArticleCountData`, but it's not yet fully integrated or used in rendering. `months` and `categories` are not yet defined for `lineChartData`.
*   **Further Refinement of Chart Data (11/25/2025, 11:41:40 AM):**
    *   The `lineChartData` now correctly processes `mediaArticleCountData` to group by `brand_name` and `month`, preparing data for a line chart. `months` and `categories` are now properly derived from `mediaArticleCountData`.
    *   The `lineChartData` is still not rendered, but its data processing logic is complete.
*   **Rendering Media Article Count (11/25/2025, 11:52:14 AM - 11:59:12 AM):** A new chart for "Media Article Count" is introduced and rendered conditionally when "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" is selected. This new chart uses `lineChartData`.
*   **Styling/Layout Changes (11/25/2025, 11:55:47 AM - 12:01:19 PM):** Minor CSS adjustments are made, specifically increasing the `font-size` for the "Ranking with Competitors" table headers and rows (`text-[10px]` to `text-[11px]`, then `text-[12px]`, and finally `text-[13px]`). The height of the Quality of Mentions pie chart is adjusted (`height={200}` to `height={190}`). The `plotOptions.pie.donut` size is changed from `0%` to `50%` with `dataLabels.offset: -15` for the pie chart. The main report title changes from "Media Score Report" to "Media Score".

**2. `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**

*   **Initial State (11/25/2025, 10:20:13 AM):** The `Report` component is responsible for generating a PDF report using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`. It includes a `downloadPDFWithLinks` function to capture sections (defined by `.pdf-section` class) and add them to a PDF. It renders `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `ShareOfVoiceReport`, `SpokePersonReport`, and `CatelogReport` components. It passes `msSelectedComps` and `msMentionCountMediaTypes` to `MediaScore`.
*   **Prop Expansion (11/25/2025, 10:21:04 AM):** New props `msImpactScorePeriod` and `msImpactScoreMediaTypes` are added to the `Report` component, to be eventually passed down to `MediaScore`.
*   **Prop Passing (11/25/2025, 10:22:47 AM):** The newly added props (`msImpactScorePeriod`, `msImpactScoreMediaTypes`) are passed down to the `MediaScore` component.
*   **Console Logging (11/25/2025, 10:37:09 AM):** `console.log` statements are added to show the values of `msImpactScorePeriod` and `msImpactScoreMediaTypes`.
*   **Commented Out Code (11/25/2025, 11:16:58 AM):** The entire file content is temporarily commented out.
*   **Data Fetching Centralization (11/25/2025, 11:16:58 AM):**
    *   The `Report` component is uncommented and undergoes a major refactor.
    *   It now directly imports `userService` and API constants (`MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA`, `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS`, `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH`).
    *   It introduces `useState` hooks for all data needed by `MediaScore` (`mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`, `brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`, `loading`).
    *   Three helper functions (`fetchMediaImpactGraphData`, `fetchMediaMentionCountData`, `fetchBrandImpactAndRelated`) are defined *outside* the `Report` component, and are then called within a `useEffect` hook.
    *   The `useEffect` hook now performs the data fetching based on `msSelectedComps`, calling the appropriate helper functions and updating the state variables.
    *   The `MediaScore` component now receives these state variables as props.
*   **Initial `Media Article Count` Integration (11/25/2025, 11:42:33 AM):**
    *   A new constant `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT` is imported.
    *   A new state variable `mediaArticleCountData` is introduced.
    *   A `loadMediaArticleCount` function is defined to fetch data for `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT`.
    *   The `useEffect` logic is updated to call `loadMediaArticleCount` when `msSelectedComps` includes "Media Article Count".
*   **Prop for `msMediaArticleMediaTypes` (11/25/2025, 11:45:01 AM):** A new prop `msMediaArticleMediaTypes` is added to `Report` and passed to the `loadMediaArticleCount` function.
*   **Duplicate `loadMediaArticleCount` calls (11/25/2025, 11:47:44 AM):** An apparent mistake, `loadMediaArticleCount()` is called twice when `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Impact Score Chart")` and `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Article Count")` conditions are met, suggesting a possible misnamed condition or redundant call.
*   **Performance Metrics Data (11/25/2025, 12:06:33 PM):**
    *   New constants for performance metrics (`GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_NO_OF_MENTIONS`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`) are imported.
    *   New state variables are introduced: `mediaPerformanceSovData`, `mediaPerformanceNoOfMentionsData`, `mediaPerformanceSentimentScoreData`.
    *   `loadPerformanceSov`, `loadPerformanceNoOfMention`, and `loadPerformanceSentiment` functions are added to fetch this data.
    *   The `useEffect` is updated to call these new loading functions when "Performance Metrics" is included in `msSelectedComps`, passing `msPerformanceMetricPeriod` to the API calls.
    *   The `MediaScore` component is updated to receive `mediaPerformanceSovData` as a prop.
    *   The duplicate call to `loadMediaArticleCount` for "Media Article Count" (when "Media Impact Score Chart" is selected) is removed, and now `loadMediaArticleCount` is correctly tied to the "Media Article Count" selection.
    *   The `msPerformanceMetricPeriod` is added to the `useEffect` dependency array.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Conditional Rendering/Fetching:** Both components heavily rely on the `msSelectedComps` prop to conditionally fetch data and render specific sections of the report. This suggests a modular report generation system where users can select which sections to include.
*   **`useEffect` for Data Fetching:** The `useEffect` hook is consistently used in both components for managing side effects, primarily data fetching from a `userService`.
*   **`useState` for Data Management:** State variables are used extensively to store fetched data and loading status.
*   **`ReactApexChart` for Visualizations:** All chart visualizations (line, bar, pie) consistently use the `ReactApexChart` library, with recurring chart options such as `fontFamily: "Inter, sans-serif"`, legend positioning, axis styling, and toolbar/zoom settings.
*   **API Service Usage:** A `userService` is uniformly used for making API calls, with `get` and `post` methods. API endpoints are imported from a `@/constants` file.
*   **Error Handling and Loading States:** Basic error handling (`try-catch`) and loading state management (`setLoading(true/false)`) are present in data fetching logic.
*   **PDF Generation Logic:** The `Report.jsx` file contains a consistent pattern for generating PDF from HTML elements using `html2canvas-pro` and `jspdf`, including applying/removing specific styles for PDF rendering.
*   **Data Transformation Functions:** Several `transform...Data` functions (e.g., `transformMediaImpactData`, `transformMediaMentionCountData`) are present to adapt raw API responses into a format suitable for the `ReactApexChart` library.
*   **Commented Code:** There's a recurring pattern of commenting out large blocks of code, indicating iterative development, debugging, or temporary disabling of features. This happens multiple times for the entire file content, and then specific blocks are uncommented or changed.

Overall, the changes reflect a progression from static data to dynamic data fetching, a refactoring to centralize data fetching in the parent `Report` component, and further integration of various metrics and charts into the "Media Score Report" section based on user selections.

## 2:06:21 PM
The code change log primarily details iterative modifications to three HTML files intended for email campaigns: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail.html`, `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail1.html`, and `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail2.html`. The changes occur rapidly between 12:51:53 PM and 1:30:56 PM on 11/25/2025, indicating an active development and refinement process for the mailer content.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail.html` (12:51:53 PM - 1:05:34 PM):**
    *   **Initial Structure and Offer (12:51:53 PM):** The mailer starts with a header featuring "Skribe Paid PR Service" and "Connecting Newsmakers To Newsmedia," a Skribe logo, and a personalized greeting (`$$Client Name/First Name$$`). It introduces an "exclusive Skribe Bundle campaign" emphasizing a "discounted rate for 6-PR or 10-PR volume." A "Real Cost of Waiting" section includes a table comparing 10-PR Bundle prices with 10 singles, highlighting savings (e.g., ₹21,000, ₹27,000). A "Last Call for the Strategy Session" offers a "Free 1-Hour Strategy Session" bonus, expiring next week, with a prominent call-to-action (CTA) button to "Lock In My 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session."
    *   **Content Expansion (12:56:27 PM):** New paragraphs were added to elaborate on usage patterns and cost savings for 6 or more PRs. A new section, "The VIP Cost-Per-PR," was introduced with a placeholder for a detailed pricing table.
    *   **Major Reorganization and Pricing Details (12:58:07 PM):** The mailer was restructured. The dynamic `$$Client Name/First Name$$` placeholder was changed to a static "Client Name/First Name." The original "Real Cost of Waiting" table and the initial strategy session promotion were temporarily removed or shifted in emphasis. A comprehensive "VIP Pricing Table" was introduced and fully populated, detailing "Single Price (x1)," "Price Per PR in 10-PR Bundle," and "Total Savings." A new "Upgrade Bonus: An Exclusive Add-On" section explicitly offered a "Free 1-Hour Strategy Session" (₹5,000 value) for 6-PR or 10-PR bundles, with a clear "This bonus disappears next week!" warning. The CTA button was updated to "Upgrade to 6 or 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session." A footer with social media links and an unsubscribe option was added.
    *   **Content Restoration and Refinement (12:58:32 PM - 1:05:34 PM):** The mailer content underwent several rapid iterations:
        *   The initial "Real Cost of Waiting" messaging and table were largely re-integrated, resulting in some duplication of pricing information.
        *   Headings were adjusted (e.g., "The VIP Cost-Per-PR" became "The Real Cost of Waiting" in the section with the detailed bundle prices).
        *   **Significant effort was made to correct and align the pricing data within both pricing tables**, especially for the "VIP Pricing Table," which saw multiple updates to individual cell values and column headers (e.g., changing from "Single Price (x1)" to "10-PR Bundle Price (Today)"). By 1:04:07 PM, both pricing tables appear consistent and logically structured, showing specific package costs and savings.
        *   The CTA button text reverted to "Lock In My 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session" by 1:00:17 PM.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail1.html` (1:06:09 PM - 1:30:56 PM):**
    *   **Forking and Initial Changes (1:06:09 PM - 1:06:56 PM):** This file was created as a copy of `Week3_Mail.html` (at its 1:05:34 PM state). The introductory paragraph was rewritten to emphasize the "final two weeks" of the bundle offer for new users. The previous "Real Cost of Waiting" section (the initial detailed table) was removed. Crucially, the "The Real Cost of Waiting" heading (which contained the VIP pricing table) was renamed to "Limited Time Bonus: Free Press Release Audit," and the accompanying paragraph was rewritten to describe a new bonus: a "Free 1-on-1 Strategy Audit" for 3-PR Bundles, with its own specific expiry. The original "Last Call for the Strategy Session" text and CTA remained, creating a conflicting message.
    *   **Bonus Clarification and Structural Overhaul (1:21:30 PM - 1:23:25 PM):**
        *   Minor text refinements and a new explanatory sentence ("This ensures you maximize the impact...") were added for the new "Free Press Release Audit" bonus.
        *   A paragraph explicitly stated: "This audit bonus is exclusive to purchases made THIS WEEK."
        *   The VIP pricing table was completely *removed* from this version of the mailer.
        *   The conflicting "Last Call for the Strategy Session" section was replaced with a new section titled "Start Strong and Save."
        *   This new section included a new introductory paragraph and a `<ul>` list detailing two specific "3-PR Bundle" offers (ANI + 250 for ₹25,800 and ANI + BS + 250 with ₹1,800 saving), explicitly mentioning the audit bonus.
        *   The main CTA button was updated to "Get the 3-PR Bundle + Free Audit (Expires Friday)," solidifying the new promotional focus.
    *   **Final Textual Refinements (1:23:38 PM - 1:30:56 PM):**
        *   Minor styling adjustments to list margins.
        *   Bolding was added to emphasize "THIS WEEK" for the audit bonus, specific package names in the `<ul>` list, and phrases like "Free 1-on-1 Strategy Audit."
        *   A new concluding red warning text, "The Bundle Offer Ends Soon. Don't Wait.", was added.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail2.html` (1:13:38 PM - 1:20:49 PM):**
    *   **Forking and Emphasis (1:13:38 PM - 1:20:49 PM):** This file was created as another copy of `Week3_Mail.html` (at its 1:05:34 PM state). This version retains the dual pricing tables (both the "Real Cost of Waiting" table and the "VIP Pricing Table"). The primary changes involve adding bold emphasis (`<strong>` or `span style="font-weight: 700;"`) to key figures and phrases: "6-PR" and "10-PR" in the introduction, "ANI + BS + PTI + 250" and "₹27,000 more" in the "Real Cost of Waiting" text, and "Free 1-Hour" and "6-PR or 10-PR" in the "Last Call for the Strategy Session" paragraph.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

*   **Consistent Mailer Template:** All files maintain a consistent HTML email structure using nested tables for layout, inline CSS for styling, and a maximum width of 700px.
*   **Branding and Contact Info:** The Skribe logo, "Skribe Paid PR Service," "Connecting Newsmakers To Newsmedia," social media links (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram), and `www.goskribe.com` link remain constant across all versions, typically in the header and footer. An unsubscribe link is also consistently present.
*   **Call to Action:** A prominent blue CTA button with a Google Sheets link is a central feature, though its text dynamically changes to reflect the specific offer being promoted.
*   **Pricing and Discounts:** The core message revolves around encouraging users to purchase PR bundles for significant cost savings compared to single purchases. This is conveyed through explicit comparisons and pricing tables.
*   **Limited-Time Offers:** A sense of urgency is consistently applied, whether through "ends next week," "bonus disappears next week!", or "Expires Friday," and often highlighted with bold or red text.
*   **Evolving Promotions:** The logs show an evolution of the promotional strategy, starting with an emphasis on 6-PR/10-PR bundles and a "Strategy Session" bonus (in `Week3_Mail.html` and `Week3_Mail2.html`), then shifting to focus on 3-PR bundles with a "Free Press Release Audit" bonus (in `Week3_Mail1.html`).
*   **Copyediting and Refinement:** There are many small, rapid changes to text, bolding, and table data, indicating a detailed proofreading and content adjustment phase to optimize clarity and accuracy of the offers.

## 2:13:39 PM
The provided log details significant refactoring and feature additions across two React components: `MediaScore.jsx` and `Report.jsx`, primarily occurring on **November 24th and 25th, 2025**. The `.env` file, containing environment variables, was identified and excluded from the summary as requested.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Development (11/24, 5:14 PM - 5:16 PM):** The component was initially set up to display media impact and mention count data, incorporating dynamic `ReactApexChart` for visualization. It started with some hardcoded data and an incomplete `useState` declaration for `mediaMentionCountData`, which was quickly corrected.
    *   **Refactoring & API Integration (11/24, 5:26 PM - 11/25, 10:28 AM):** Key hardcoded data (`mediaImpactScore`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`, `mediaMentionData`) were progressively replaced with dynamic state variables. The `useEffect` hook was enhanced to conditionally fetch data from various API endpoints (`MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA`, `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS`, `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH`) using `userService`. This involved introducing new props (`msImpactScorePeriod`, `msImpactScoreMediaTypes`) to control data fetching parameters.
    *   **Shift to Presentational Component (11/25, 11:30 AM onwards):** A major architectural change occurred where `MediaScore.jsx` was transformed into a more presentational component. Its internal state (`mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`, `brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`) and API fetching logic were removed and externalized, implying they were hoisted to a parent component (later confirmed to be `Report.jsx`).
    *   **Chart and UI Refinements (11/25, 11:37 AM - 12:01 PM):** Continuous adjustments were made to chart configurations (e.g., `lineChartData`, `qualityPieChartData` options, colors, markers, axis styles), chart heights (e.g., `height={400}` to `height={240}` for article count), and text sizes (`text-[8px]` to `text-[14px]`) and layout elements (e.g., removing borders, adjusting pie chart `donut.size` and `dataLabels.offset`). The main title was changed from "Media Score Report" to "Media Score."
    *   **New Data Props (11/25, 11:49 AM - 12:26 PM):** New props such as `mediaArticleCountData` and `mediaPerformanceSovData` were introduced to receive pre-fetched data from the parent.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup (11/25, 10:20 AM - 10:22 AM):** This component was responsible for orchestrating the overall report generation, including PDF download functionality using `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro`. It rendered several sub-components like `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, etc. and passed initial props to `MediaScore`.
    *   **State Hoisting and API Orchestration (11/25, 11:16 AM onwards):** This component took over the state management and API fetching logic that was removed from `MediaScore.jsx`. It introduced multiple `useState` hooks for various data segments (`mediaImpactGraphData`, `mediaMentionCountData`, `brandImpactData`, `competitorRanking`, `qualityOfMentions`, `mediaArticleCountData`, `mediaPerformanceSovData`, `mediaPerformanceNoOfMentionsData`, `mediaPerformanceSentimentScoreData`).
    *   **Modularized Data Loading (11/25, 11:16 AM - 12:26 PM):** Dedicated asynchronous functions (`loadMediaImpactGraphData`, `loadMediaMentionCountData`, `loadBrandImpactAndRelatedData`, `loadMediaArticleCount`, `loadPerformanceSov`, `loadPerformanceNoOfMention`, `loadPerformanceSentiment`) were created within the `Report` component's `useEffect` hook to fetch specific data based on `msSelectedComps` and other report parameters. These functions utilize `userService` to call various backend endpoints (`MEDIA_IMPACT_GRAPH_DATA`, `MEDIA_MENTIONS_GRAPH_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS`, `MEDIASCORE_QOM_GRAPH`, `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT`, `GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_NO_OF_MENTIONS`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`).
    *   **Conditional Rendering:** The `MediaScore` child component's rendering became conditional (`msSelectedComps.length > 0`), and all the fetched data states are passed down as props to it.
    *   **Bug Fixing and Refinement (11/25, 11:42 AM - 12:26 PM):** Several commits addressed logical errors, including duplicated function calls, incorrect state updates, and misassigned API endpoints during the complex refactoring of data fetching.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **State Management Evolution:** A clear pattern of "lifting state up" is observed, moving data fetching and state management from a child component (`MediaScore`) to a parent component (`Report`) for better control and separation of concerns.
*   **Iterative Development with Commenting:** Large blocks of code were frequently commented out, modified, and then uncommented, suggesting an iterative development process involving significant temporary changes or debugging.
*   **API-Driven Data Visualization:** The continuous introduction and integration of new API endpoints (`GET_BRAND_IMPACT_SCORE`, `RANKING_WITH_COMPETITORS`, `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT`, `GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, etc.) into `useEffect` hooks highlight an ongoing effort to make the report dynamic and data-driven.
*   **Visual Customization:** Frequent changes to chart styling properties (colors, labels, axis, legend) and element dimensions (height, font size) indicate a strong focus on refining the visual presentation of the reports.
*   **Dependency Array Management:** The `useEffect` dependency arrays were regularly updated to ensure correct re-fetching of data when relevant props changed.

## 4:06:45 PM
The code changes log details the evolution of several HTML email templates for a "Skribe Paid PR Service - VIP Bundle Upgrade" campaign, all occurring on November 25, 2025. The changes show a clear iterative process of refining promotional messages, pricing details, and bonus offers across different versions of the email.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail.html`:**
    *   **Initial Draft (12:51:53 PM):** This version introduced the core promotional content, including a header with the Skribe logo and tagline, a personalized client greeting (`$$Client Name/First Name$$`), a section on "The Real Cost of Waiting" with a price comparison table for 10-PR bundles, and a "Last Call for the Strategy Session" bonus (Free 1-Hour Strategy Session for 6-PR or 10-PR bundles).
    *   **Significant Expansion (12:56:27 PM):** The email's body content was greatly expanded to include more descriptive text, a new "The VIP Cost-Per-PR" section (initially with an incomplete table), and clearer details about the strategy session bonus value (₹5,000). Social media links and an unsubscribe module were added in the footer. The Call-to-Action (CTA) button text was updated to "Upgrade to 6 or 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session".
    *   **Data Loss and Partial Restoration (12:57:59 PM - 12:58:32 PM):** The file was temporarily emptied at 12:57:59 PM, indicating a critical data loss. It was then partially restored at 12:58:07 PM, reverting some text elements and changing the client greeting placeholder to `Client Name/First Name`. The pricing tables underwent several corrections and reformatting, eventually consolidating the bundle vs. single price comparison by **1:01:44 PM**.
    *   **Refinement (1:00:17 PM - 1:05:34 PM):** Minor text adjustments, including changing the CTA back to "Lock In My 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session" and removing a closing paragraph, were observed.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail1.html`:**
    *   **New Variant Creation (1:06:09 PM):** This file was created as a new version of the mailer, inheriting the structure and content similar to the refined `Week3_Mail.html` at that time.
    *   **Shift in Offer Focus (1:06:24 PM - 1:06:56 PM):** A significant change occurred as the introductory paragraph was rewritten to target new customers, and a new "Limited Time Bonus: Free Press Release Audit" was introduced, specifically for "3-PR Bundles". This bonus was further detailed.
    *   **Major Campaign Rework (1:23:10 PM - 1:23:38 PM):** The "Last Call for the Strategy Session" section was renamed "Start Strong and Save", and the CTA button was dramatically altered to "Get the 3-PR Bundle + Free Audit (Expires Friday)". A bulleted list detailing specific 3-PR bundle pricing (e.g., ANI + 250 for ₹25,800) was added, indicating a shift towards promoting lower-tier bundles with a different bonus.
    *   **Urgency and Formatting (1:23:56 PM - 1:30:56 PM):** An explicit urgency message, "The Bundle Offer Ends Soon. Don't Wait.", was added and styled in red. Further updates involved bolding key phrases (e.g., "time is now," "Free 1-on-1 Strategy Audit," "THIS WEEK," "ANI + 250 or PTI + 250") and adjusting paragraph margins for better visual emphasis and readability.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail2.html`:**
    *   **Another Variant (1:13:38 PM):** This file was introduced, closely resembling the stable `Week3_Mail.html` content, maintaining the focus on 6-PR or 10-PR bundles and the 1-Hour Strategy Session bonus.
    *   **Emphasis through Bolding (1:14:52 PM - 1:20:49 PM):** The primary changes in this file involved adding inline styling (`<span>` tags with `font-weight: 700;`) to bold various key phrases, numbers, and package names throughout the email content, such as "6-PR", "10-PR", "ANI + BS + PTI + 250", "₹27,000 more", and "Free 1-Hour", to highlight important information.

*   **Pricing Focus:** Price comparisons showcasing savings for bundle purchases are central to the marketing strategy across all variants.
*   **Bonus Incentives:** The emails consistently offer added value through bonuses (e.g., "Free 1-Hour Strategy Session," "Free Press Release Audit") tied to purchasing specific PR bundles, often with short validity periods.
*   **Dynamic Client Greeting:** The use of "Client Name/First Name" (or `$$Client Name/First Name$$` initially) indicates these are templates designed for personalization.
*   **Stylistic Emphasis:** A noticeable pattern in later changes involves applying bold (`<strong>` or `font-weight` via `<span>`) to key terms, package names, and prices to enhance readability and highlight important details.
*   **Common CTA Link:** All versions consistently use the same Google Sheets URL for their Call-to-Action.

## 4:12:10 PM
This log primarily details a series of iterative changes to two React components: `MediaScore.jsx` and `Report.jsx`, and a brief modification to an environment file.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **Initial State (11/25/2025, 11:37:10 AM):** The component `MediaScore` is responsible for rendering various media-related metrics and charts using `react-apexcharts`. It includes transformations for `mediaImpactGraphData` and `mediaMentionCountData`, and displays overall `Media Impact Score`, `Ranking with Competitors` (in a table), and `Quality of Mentions Split` (pie chart).
    *   **Minor Refactorings and UI Tweaks (11:37:46 AM - 11:39:22 AM):** These timestamps show minor changes in the rendering logic, primarily related to how the initial `Media Impact Score (Previous Months)` section is conditionally rendered. A direct `<Chart />` component was briefly introduced and then wrapped in a conditional block. The content remained largely the same, indicating UI placement adjustments.
    *   **Introduction of `mediaArticleCountData` and corresponding chart (11:40:41 AM - 11:54:47 AM):** A significant new feature was added to process and display "Media Article Count" data.
        *   A new `groupedByBrand` object and `series` transformation are introduced, which likely prepare data for a new line chart.
        *   The `MediaScore` component's props were updated to include `mediaArticleCountData`.
        *   A new chart section titled "Media Article Count" was added to the JSX, rendering a `ReactApexChart` of type "line".
        *   The height of this new chart was adjusted from `400` to `240` (11:54:47 AM).
    *   **Styling Adjustments for Tables and Charts (11:55:29 AM - 11:58:14 AM):** The height of the "Quality of Mentions Split" pie chart was adjusted (from 220 to 200, then to 180). Font sizes in the "Ranking with Competitors" table and the title of the "Quality of Mentions Split" section were incremented (from 8px to 10px, 11px, 12px, 13px, and 14px respectively). The `border` class was removed from the "Ranking with Competitors" section (11:58:40 AM), and then from "Quality of Mentions Split" section (11:58:55 AM), although the enclosing `div` retained its border.
    *   **Pie Chart Donut Configuration (12:00:33 PM - 12:00:45 PM):** The `plotOptions.pie.donut` configuration was explicitly set to `size: "50%"` and `dataLabels: { offset: -15 }`, indicating a change to a donut chart style with adjusted data label positioning.
    *   **Header and Prop updates for Performance Metrics (12:26:54 PM - 2:41:10 PM):**
        *   The `MediaScore` component's props were expanded to include `mediaPerformanceSovData`, `mediaPerformanceNoOfMentionsData`, and `mediaPerformanceSentimentScoreData`.
        *   A new "Performance Metrics" section was added to the component's JSX, displaying "Average Share of Voice", "No of Mentions", and "Sentiment Score" with their respective change percentages.
        *   This section dynamically displays data using `mediaPerformanceSovData`, `mediaPerformanceNoOfMentionsData`, `mediaPerformanceSentimentScoreData`, and includes `Skeleton` loading states.
        *   The font sizes for the main metrics in this section were adjusted multiple times (from `text-2xl` to `text-xl`, then `text-lg`). The heading size for "Performance Metrics" was also changed from `sm:text-lg` to `text-md`, and then the `sm:text-lg` was removed leaving it at `font-semibold`.
        *   The border for the Performance Metrics cards was changed from `#E2E8EF` to `#00000033` (2:23:52 PM).

2.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Initial State (11/25/2025, 11:39:52 AM):** This component serves as a container for various reports (`ShareOfVoiceReport`, `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`). It includes PDF download functionality using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`. It fetches data for `MediaScore` components via `userService` and uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for data management.
    *   **New Constant Import and Data Loading Logic (11:42:33 AM - 11:45:01 AM):**
        *   A new constant `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT` was imported.
        *   The `Report` component's props were updated to include `msMediaArticleMediaTypes`.
        *   A new state `mediaArticleCountData` was introduced.
        *   A `loadMediaArticleCount` function was added to fetch data for `GET_MEDIA_ARTICLE_COUNT` using `msMediaArticleMediaTypes`.
        *   Conditional loading logic for `mediaArticleCountData` was added based on `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Article Count")`.
    *   **Refinement of Performance Metrics Data Loading (12:12:11 PM - 12:25:16 PM):**
        *   Added new state variables: `mediaPerformanceSovData`, `mediaPerformanceNoOfMentionsData`, `mediaPerformanceSentimentScoreData`.
        *   Introduced new prop `msPerformanceMetricPeriod`.
        *   Created new async functions: `loadPerformanceSov`, `loadPerformanceNoOfMention`, and `loadPerformanceSentiment` to fetch data from `GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_NO_OF_MENTIONS`, and `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE` respectively, utilizing the `msPerformanceMetricPeriod`.
        *   Implemented conditional loading for these new performance metrics based on `msSelectedComps.includes("Performance Metrics")`.
        *   The dependency array for `useEffect` was updated to include `msPerformanceMetricPeriod`.
    *   **Prop Drilling to `MediaScore` (12:26:14 PM):** The newly added performance metric state variables (`mediaPerformanceSovData`, `mediaPerformanceNoOfMentionsData`, `mediaPerformanceSentimentScoreData`) were passed down as props to the `MediaScore` component.

3.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **Comment Out (3:25:17 PM):** A substantial portion of the SentimentReport component, including dummy data and rendering logic, was commented out. This indicates a temporary disabling or planned refactor of these sections.
    *   **Dynamic Data Integration (3:26:41 PM):** The component was updated to dynamically use `sentiPerformanceMetricData` and `sentiCompAnalysisData` props instead of hardcoded `performanceMetrics` and `comparativeData`.
        *   The `performance` object now derives its values from `sentiPerformanceMetricData` (with nullish coalescing `??` for defaults).
        *   The `comparativeData` array is now mapped directly from `sentiCompAnalysisData`.
        *   Conditional rendering logic using `performance.sentimentScore.change?.startsWith("-")` determines text color (red for negative, green for positive change).
    *   **Console Logs and UI Adjustments (3:01:32 PM - 3:04:29 PM, 3:55:41 PM - 3:58:36 PM):** Console logs (`console.log("sentiment", ...)`) were added for debugging the `sentiPerformanceMetricData` and `sentiCompAnalysisData` props. An "AI-generated opinion on Media Impact" section was added, which renders `aiResponse` as a list of bullet points. The font size for the Quick Take and AI response list items was adjusted from `text-sm` to `text-xs`.

4.  **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **Prop Update and Dynamic Article Rendering (3:43:39 PM - 3:46:44 PM):**
        *   The `ArticleCard` component now expects an `article` prop directly instead of `catalogArticles`.
        *   The `CatelogReport` component's `catalogArticles` prop is now used to map and render `ArticleCard` components.
        *   Optional chaining (`?.`) was added for `article.mtxtarticlesummary` and `article.vchsentiment` to prevent errors if these properties are undefined.
        *   The `max-h-[640px] overflow-y-auto` classes were removed from the articles list container, implying a change in how the list handles overflowing content.
        *   Removed hardcoded "Outlet tags dummy" section, implying this data will also be dynamic later.

### General Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Chart-heavy components:** `MediaScore` and `SentimentReport` heavily rely on `react-apexcharts` for data visualization (line, bar, and pie charts).
*   **Data Transformation Logic:** Both `MediaScore` and `SentimentReport` include `transform*Data` or `create*Chart` functions, which take raw data and format it into a structure suitable for ApexCharts.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Many sections within `MediaScore` are conditionally rendered based on `msSelectedComps.includes(...)`, indicating a modular and configurable report structure.
*   **Performance Metrics Display:** A recurring pattern is the display of key performance metrics (score, change percentage) with conditional styling for positive/negative changes (green/red text). Skeleton loaders are used in `MediaScore` for these metrics.
*   **PDF Generation:** The `Report.jsx` file consistently implements `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro` for generating PDF reports, including a mechanism to preserve links.
*   **Data Fetching:** The `Report.jsx` component uses `userService` to fetch various types of report data from different API endpoints defined in `@/constants`. It uses `useState` and `useEffect` for managing and updating this data based on selected components and time periods.
*   **Prop Drilling:** Data is passed down through props from `Report.jsx` (the parent container) to its child report components (`MediaScore`, `Sentiment`).
*   **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Extensive use of utility classes (e.g., `flex`, `justify-between`, `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `rounded-xl`, `text-sm`, `font-semibold`, `text-green-500`, `border`) suggests the project uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Dates:** All timestamps are on `11/25/2025`, indicating these changes were made on the same day.

## 5:06:05 PM
The log details a series of iterative changes to a single HTML file: `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail.html`, which was later duplicated and further modified as `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail1.html` and `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\GOSKRIBE MAILER\Dishant\Week3_Mail2.html`. All changes occurred on **11/25/2025** between **12:51:53 PM** and **1:30:56 PM**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`Week3_Mail.html` (12:51:53 PM - 1:05:34 PM):**
    *   The initial version is a marketing email promoting "Skribe Paid PR Service - VIP Bundle Upgrade." It features a header with the Skribe logo, a main title, and a "Connecting Newsmakers To Newsmedia" subtitle.
    *   It addresses the recipient as "Client Name/First Name" and highlights a "final stages" campaign for PR bundles (6-PR or 10-PR).
    *   A prominent "The Real Cost of Waiting" section with a table compares "10-PR Bundle Price (Today)" vs. "Cost of 10 Singles (Next Month)" for two packages: "ANI + PTI + 250" and "ANI + BS + PTI + 250," showing significant savings.
    *   It advertises a "Last Call for the Strategy Session" bonus for purchasing bundles by the end of the week.
    *   A call-to-action (CTA) button links to a Google Sheet to "Lock In My 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session."
    *   Later updates (around 12:56 PM to 12:58 PM) significantly expanded the content, introducing:
        *   A paragraph explaining the math behind savings for users sending 6+ PRs.
        *   A new section titled "The VIP Cost-Per-PR" with a visual divider.
        *   A "VIP Pricing Table" offering detailed cost-per-PR comparison and total savings for 10-PR commitments for packages like "ANI + BS + 250" and "ANI + BS + PTI + 250."
        *   Text emphasizing that bundles effectively offer "1 to 2 press releases completely free."
        *   A new section "Upgrade Bonus: An Exclusive Add-On" reiterating the "Free 1-Hour Strategy Session" bonus (₹5,000 value), with a warning "This bonus disappears next week!"
        *   Updated CTA text for the button to "Upgrade to 6 or 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session."
        *   Added a concluding remark "To your continued success, The Skribe Team."
        *   Added social media links (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram) and the company website in the footer.
    *   Subsequent minor changes refined text, such as bolding specific package names or monetary values, and adjusting heading titles (e.g., "The VIP Cost-Per-PR" was changed to "The Real Cost of Waiting" in the header table and then back to "The VIP Cost-Per-PR" in a later section, only to be changed to "The Real Cost of Waiting" again and then the "Upgrade Bonus" section's heading was changed to "Last Call for the Strategy Session").
    *   The "VIP Pricing Table" content was notably changed several times, including the prices listed for "ANI + BS + 250" and "ANI + BS + PTI + 250" packages, and in some iterations, the "10-PR Bundle Price (Today)" column contained incorrect single prices. The final stable state of this table for `Week3_Mail.html` (1:05:34 PM) correctly shows "10-PR Bundle Price (Today)" and "Cost of 10 Singles (Next Month)" for two packages with their respective differences.

*   **`Week3_Mail1.html` (1:06:09 PM - 1:30:56 PM):**
    *   This file appears to be a derivative or a new version based on `Week3_Mail.html`. The initial content (1:06:09 PM) is largely similar to the later stages of `Week3_Mail.html`.
    *   A significant textual change occurred in the introductory paragraph (1:06:24 PM): "As an active member of the Skribe community, you already know the power and efficiency of our platform. You send press releases regularly." was replaced with "The exclusive Skribe PR Bundle offer is entering its final two weeks. If you’ve been waiting for the absolute best time to make your first move into professional PR, that time is now."
    *   The "VIP Cost-Per-PR Section" heading was modified from "The Real Cost of Waiting" to "Limited Time Bonus: Free Press Release Audit" (1:06:43 PM).
    *   A new paragraph detailing the "Free 1-on-1 Strategy Audit" bonus for purchasing "ANY of our 3-PR Bundles" was added (1:06:56 PM).
    *   Repetitive paragraphs about the audit bonus were added and then consolidated/refined (1:22:03 PM - 1:28:23 PM).
    *   A new section with a heading "Start Strong and Save" was introduced, containing a bulleted list of 3-PR bundle prices with audit bonuses (1:23:10 PM).
    *   The CTA button text was updated to "👉 Get the 3-PR Bundle + Free Audit (Expires Friday)" (1:23:38 PM).
    *   An additional call-to-action "The Bundle Offer Ends Soon. Don't Wait." was added and stylized in red (1:24:38 PM).
    *   Further emphasis was added to "ANI + 250 or PTI + 250" within a sentence about the audit bonus (1:30:48 PM).

*   **`Week3_Mail2.html` (1:13:38 PM - 1:20:49 PM):**
    *   This file also branches off, sharing similarities with the `Week3_Mail.html` lineage.
    *   Key changes here focus on bolding certain phrases to draw attention, such as "6-PR" and "10-PR" volumes, "ANI + BS + PTI + 250", "₹27,000 more", "Free 1-Hour" and "6-PR or 10-PR" within the bonus description. These changes are exclusively about styling specific text elements to make them stand out.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent File Structure:** All versions maintain the same basic HTML email structure (DOCTYPE, html, head, body, nested tables for layout).
*   **Branding Consistency:** The header section with the "Skribe Logo" and "Skribe Paid PR Service / Connecting Newsmakers To Newsmedia" remains identical across all file versions and timestamps.
*   **Call-to-Action Evolution:** The CTA button text evolves throughout the process, reflecting changes in the highlighted offer (from a general "Lock In My 10-PR Bundle & Claim Strategy Session" to one specifically mentioning the "3-PR Bundle + Free Audit" and its expiration).
*   **Pricing and Savings Emphasis:** A significant portion of the content is dedicated to showcasing PR bundle pricing, cost comparisons, and total savings (in ₹). Tables are consistently used to present this information, although the specific values and clarity of the table headers are adjusted.
*   **Bonus Offers:** The mailers consistently promote a limited-time bonus, either a "Free 1-Hour Strategy Session" (for 6-PR or 10-PR bundles) or a "Free 1-on-1 Strategy Audit" (for 3-PR bundles), often with an "ends next week/expires Friday" urgency.
*   **Social Media Footer:** A standard footer with links to Skribe's Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, and website is present in most versions, indicating a consistent branding and outreach strategy.
*   **Personalization Placeholder:** The "Client Name/First Name" placeholder is retained throughout, suggesting the emails are templated for individual recipients.

In summary, the logs indicate an iterative development process for several email marketing templates for "Skribe Paid PR Service." The primary focus of these changes is on refining the promotional message, clarifying pricing benefits, introducing or modifying bonus offers, and adjusting calls-to-action, with a clear pattern of emphasizing urgency and value for PR bundle purchases.
