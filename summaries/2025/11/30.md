# Activity Summary for 11/30/2025

## 1:36:13 PM
The provided logs show two entries for the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js` at timestamps 11/29/2025, 1:45:30 PM and 11/29/2025, 1:46:54 PM.

**File-specific updates:**
There are no functional code changes between the two logged versions of `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js`. Both versions are identical.

**Summary of `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js` content:**
This file acts as the main entry point for an Express.js-based e-commerce API server. It sets up various middleware, routes, and error handling mechanisms.

*   **Core Setup:** Initializes an Express application, connects to a database (`connectDatabase`), and listens on a configurable port.
*   **Security & Middleware:**
    *   Uses `helmet` for securing HTTP headers.
    *   Configures `cors` to allow requests from specific frontend origins (`netlify.app`, `vercel.app`, `localhost`).
    *   Employs `morgan("combined")` for request logging.
    *   Parses JSON and URL-encoded request bodies using `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`.
    *   Implements `express-rate-limit` with a global limit of 100 requests per 15 minutes, and more stringent limits for login (5 attempts/15 mins) and signup (3 attempts/60 mins) endpoints.
*   **API Documentation:** Integrates Swagger UI, making API documentation available at `/api-docs`.
*   **Static File Serving:** Serves static files from an "uploads" directory, likely for user-uploaded content (e.g., product images).
*   **Routing:** Defines a comprehensive set of API routes, each delegated to a specific route handler module:
    *   `/api/auth` (Authentication)
    *   `/api/users` (User management)
    *   `/api/categories` (Product categories)
    *   `/api/products` (Product listings)
    *   `/api/support` (Support inquiries)
    *   `/api/razorpay` (Payment gateway integration)
    *   `/api/orders` (Order management)
    *   Includes a catch-all `404 Not Found` route for undefined paths.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Includes specific middleware to catch and handle `multer.MulterError` instances, providing a custom response for `LIMIT_FILE_SIZE` errors (max 5MB allowed).
    *   Utilizes a general `errorHandler` middleware for other types of errors.
*   **Configuration:** Imports `config` from `./config/env.js` to access environment variables like the server port.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
While two log entries exist for `server.js` within a short span (11/29/2025, 1:45:30 PM and 11/29/2025, 1:46:54 PM), the content remained unchanged, indicating no functional or structural modifications between these specific points in time.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**
*   **Modular Architecture:** The server heavily relies on importing separate route files (`authRoutes`, `userRoutes`, etc.) for different API domains, promoting code organization.
*   **Security First:** Consistent application of security best practices, including `helmet`, `cors` with explicit allowed origins, and detailed `rateLimit` configurations.
*   **Standard Express.js Middleware Usage:** A standard set of Express middleware is used for common server functionalities like logging, body parsing, and static file serving.
*   **Centralized Error Handling:** Dedicated middleware for both general errors and specific error types (like Multer errors) ensures robust error management.
*   **API Documentation:** The inclusion of Swagger indicates a commitment to clear and accessible API documentation.
*   **E-commerce Specific Routes:** A recurring pattern of routes (`auth`, `users`, `products`, `orders`, `razorpay`) reflects the typical structure of an e-commerce backend.

The log shows changes related to the `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js` file.

**File-specific updates for `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js`:**
There are no functional code changes between the two provided timestamps (11/29/2025, 1:45:30 PM and 11/29/2025, 1:46:54 PM). The code content is identical in both entries.

**Content overview for `server.js`:**
This file appears to be the main entry point for an E-Commerce API server built with Express.js. It sets up various middleware and routes.

Key functionalities include:
*   **Core Dependencies:** Uses `express`, `cors`, `helmet`, `morgan`, `express-rate-limit`, `swagger-ui-express`, `path`, `multer`, and `colors`.
*   **Configuration & Database:** Imports `config` from `./config/env.js` and connects to the database using `connectDatabase` from `./config/database.js`.
*   **Security:** Implements `helmet` for security headers, `cors` with specific `allowedOrigins` (including local development and Netlify/Vercel deployments), and `express-rate-limit` for global and specific endpoint (login/signup) request limiting.
*   **Request Handling:** Uses `morgan` for logging, `express.json()` for JSON parsing, and `express.urlencoded()` for URL-encoded data.
*   **API Documentation:** Serves Swagger UI at `/api-docs` using `swagger-ui-express` and `swaggerSpec`.
*   **Static Files:** Serves uploaded files from an "uploads" folder at the `/uploads` endpoint.
*   **Routes:** Defines and uses dedicated route modules for `auth`, `users`, `categories`, `products`, `support`, `razorpay`, and `orders`. These are mounted under `/api/`.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes a custom Multer error handler for file size limits and other Multer-specific errors, followed by a general `errorHandler` middleware.
*   **Server Initialization:** Listens on a port defined in `config.port`, logging the server status and API documentation URL.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The provided log shows two timestamps, 11/29/2025, 1:45:30 PM and 11/29/2025, 1:46:54 PM. While these indicate when the log entries were recorded, there were no actual code modifications between them, suggesting these might be snapshots or re-saves without content alteration.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**
*   **Middleware Chaining:** Consistent use of `app.use()` to apply middleware globally or to specific paths (e.g., rate limiting).
*   **Dedicated Route Modules:** The application structure clearly separates concerns by delegating API endpoints to individual route files (e.g., `authRoutes`, `userRoutes`, `productRoutes`).
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Multiple layers of error handling are present, including specific handling for `multer` errors and a general `errorHandler` for other issues.
*   **Security Measures:** Repeated emphasis on security through `helmet`, `cors` origin restrictions, and `express-rate-limit`.
*   **Logging and Documentation:** Integration of `morgan` for request logging and Swagger for API documentation.
*   **Environment Variable Usage:** Indicated by the import of `config` from `env.js`, suggesting configuration values like the server port are externalized.
