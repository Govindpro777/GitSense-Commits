# Activity Summary for 11/30/2025

## 1:36:13 PM
The provided logs show two entries for the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js` at timestamps 11/29/2025, 1:45:30 PM and 11/29/2025, 1:46:54 PM.

**File-specific updates:**
There are no functional code changes between the two logged versions of `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js`. Both versions are identical.

**Summary of `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ECOM\src\server.js` content:**
This file acts as the main entry point for an Express.js-based e-commerce API server. It sets up various middleware, routes, and error handling mechanisms.

*   **Core Setup:** Initializes an Express application, connects to a database (`connectDatabase`), and listens on a configurable port.
*   **Security & Middleware:**
    *   Uses `helmet` for securing HTTP headers.
    *   Configures `cors` to allow requests from specific frontend origins (`netlify.app`, `vercel.app`, `localhost`).
    *   Employs `morgan("combined")` for request logging.
    *   Parses JSON and URL-encoded request bodies using `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()`.
    *   Implements `express-rate-limit` with a global limit of 100 requests per 15 minutes, and more stringent limits for login (5 attempts/15 mins) and signup (3 attempts/60 mins) endpoints.
*   **API Documentation:** Integrates Swagger UI, making API documentation available at `/api-docs`.
*   **Static File Serving:** Serves static files from an "uploads" directory, likely for user-uploaded content (e.g., product images).
*   **Routing:** Defines a comprehensive set of API routes, each delegated to a specific route handler module:
    *   `/api/auth` (Authentication)
    *   `/api/users` (User management)
    *   `/api/categories` (Product categories)
    *   `/api/products` (Product listings)
    *   `/api/support` (Support inquiries)
    *   `/api/razorpay` (Payment gateway integration)
    *   `/api/orders` (Order management)
    *   Includes a catch-all `404 Not Found` route for undefined paths.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Includes specific middleware to catch and handle `multer.MulterError` instances, providing a custom response for `LIMIT_FILE_SIZE` errors (max 5MB allowed).
    *   Utilizes a general `errorHandler` middleware for other types of errors.
*   **Configuration:** Imports `config` from `./config/env.js` to access environment variables like the server port.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
While two log entries exist for `server.js` within a short span (11/29/2025, 1:45:30 PM and 11/29/2025, 1:46:54 PM), the content remained unchanged, indicating no functional or structural modifications between these specific points in time.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**
*   **Modular Architecture:** The server heavily relies on importing separate route files (`authRoutes`, `userRoutes`, etc.) for different API domains, promoting code organization.
*   **Security First:** Consistent application of security best practices, including `helmet`, `cors` with explicit allowed origins, and detailed `rateLimit` configurations.
*   **Standard Express.js Middleware Usage:** A standard set of Express middleware is used for common server functionalities like logging, body parsing, and static file serving.
*   **Centralized Error Handling:** Dedicated middleware for both general errors and specific error types (like Multer errors) ensures robust error management.
*   **API Documentation:** The inclusion of Swagger indicates a commitment to clear and accessible API documentation.
*   **E-commerce Specific Routes:** A recurring pattern of routes (`auth`, `users`, `products`, `orders`, `razorpay`) reflects the typical structure of an e-commerce backend.
