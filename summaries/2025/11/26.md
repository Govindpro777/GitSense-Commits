# Activity Summary for 11/26/2025

## 1:13:48 PM
The log primarily details extensive development on report generation functionalities within a React-based frontend application, specifically concerning brand analytics reports like "Catalog Report," "Sentiment Report," "Spokesperson Report," and "Share of Voice Report."

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`CatelogReport.jsx` (11/25/2025, 3:43 PM - 4:49 PM; 11/26/2025, 11:06 AM - 11:10 AM):**
    *   Initial commits focused on structuring `ArticleCard` and `CatelogReport` components, including rendering article details like website, title, summary, publish date, and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral with distinct styling).
    *   Between 3:45 PM and 3:46 PM, changes involved adding optional chaining (`?.`) for `mtxtarticlesummary` and `vchsentiment` to prevent errors with potentially null or undefined data. An `overflow-y-auto` class was added to the articles container, and the component was updated to correctly map `catalogArticles` instead of `dummyArticles`.
    *   Further updates removed a dummy "Outlet tags" section and introduced conditional rendering for the articles list based on `catalogSelectedComps` to control which parts of the report are displayed (e.g., "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" or "No of Mentions").
    *   Later, minor styling adjustments changed `article.vchwebsite` text size from `text-xs` to no explicit size, then back to `text-sm`, and `text-sm` font-medium was changed back to `text-xs` font-medium on the first `p` tag in the `ArticleCard`. The `vchtitle` was also updated to slice to 180 characters.

*   **`Sentiment.jsx` (11/25/2025, 3:55 PM - 4:55 PM):**
    *   The `SentimentReport` component was introduced, leveraging `react-apexcharts` for data visualization. It displays "AI-generated opinion," "Performance Metrics" (Sentiment Score, Positive, Negative, Neutral scores with change percentages), and "Comparative Analysis" using bar charts.
    *   Initial versions defined `createSentimentChart` and rendered various sentiment-related data points.
    *   Subsequent changes (3:57 PM, 3:58 PM, 3:58 PM) primarily adjusted font sizes and styling for consistency and readability within the report (e.g., changing `AI-generated opinion` heading from `text-lg` to `text-base`, `Quick Take` from `font-medium` to `text-sm font-medium`, and `AI-generated opinion` paragraph and list items from `text-sm` to `text-xs`).
    *   Later commits (4:50 PM, 4:51 PM, 4:53 PM, 4:54 PM, 4:55 PM) introduced conditional rendering based on `sentiSelectedComps` to enable or disable sections like "AI Insights", "Performance Metrics", and "Comparative Analysis". Initially, all these sections were rendered unconditionally; later they were wrapped in `sentiSelectedComps.includes("AI Insights")` or `sentiSelectedComps.includes("Performance Metrics")` or `sentiSelectedComps.includes("Comparative Analysis")`.

*   **`SpokePersonReport.jsx` (11/25/2025, 4:32 PM - 11/26/2025, 11:25 AM):**
    *   This file saw the creation of a `SpokePersonReport` component, including placeholder data for mentions, sentiment, and top spokespersons. It uses `react-apexcharts` for bar charts (monthly mentions, sentiment split) and `react-d3-speedometer` for the change percentage.
    *   The component was updated to accept props (`spokesMentionCountData`, `spokesNoOfMentionsData`, `spokesSentimentData`, `spokesSentimentScore`, `spokesTopPersonsData`) instead of relying on dummy data, and `spokesSelectedComps` was added for conditional rendering.
    *   There were several commits where the entire file content was commented out (between 5:27 PM and 9:10 PM) and then restored. This suggests a period of extensive debugging or refactoring where the component was temporarily disabled.
    *   After restoration, the component logic was updated to use the actual props for chart data and display, with nullish coalescing (`?? 0` or `|| "0"`) for robustness.
    *   Conditional rendering was introduced using `spokesSelectedComps` to control the visibility of "Spokesperson Mention Count," "No of Mentions," "Spokesperson Sentiment Score," and "Top 5 Spokesperson" sections (9:13 PM, 9:22 PM, 11:23 AM, 11:24 AM, 11:25 AM). There were also some redundant blocks of `No of Mentions` and `Spokesperson Sentiment Score` divs, which were later commented out or replaced by the conditional logic. The speedometers and charts sizes were also adjusted slightly (`height={140}` for sentiment chart, `width={190}` or `width={250}` for speedometer).

*   **`ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx` (11/25/2025, 4:33 PM - 11/26/2025, 10:54 AM):**
    *   Introduced `ShareOfVoiceReport` with dummy data for various share of voice metrics (monthly, by mentions, by reach, average) and top journalists (brand and competitor). It uses `react-apexcharts` for bar and pie charts.
    *   Like other reports, it transitioned from using dummy data to receiving actual data through props (`sovChartData`, `sovReachData`, `sovMentionsData`, `sovBrandJournalists`, `sovCompetitorJournalists`).
    *   Multiple `console.log` statements were added (11/26/2025, 9:28 AM, 9:29 AM, 9:29 AM) for debugging `sovSelectedComps` and other data props, which were then removed.
    *   The component saw a pattern of commenting out and re-enabling large blocks of code (10:25 AM, 10:30 AM, 10:31 AM), indicating development iterations or troubleshooting.
    *   Conditional rendering based on `sovSelectedComps` was implemented to show/hide sections like "Share of Voice Chart", "Share of Voice by Mentions", "Share of Voice by Reach", "Average Share of Voice", and "Top 5 Journalists of Brand and Competitors" (10:46 AM, 10:48 AM, 10:49 AM, 10:50 AM, 10:51 AM, 10:52 AM, 10:52 AM, 10:53 AM, 10:54 AM). Some of these conditions applied to groups of charts, while others applied to individual charts.

*   **`Report.jsx` (11/25/2025, 4:36 PM):**
    *   This central report component was created to aggregate and display all individual report components (`ShareOfVoiceReport`, `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`).
    *   It defines a `downloadPDFWithLinks` function using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro` to generate PDFs, including a styling fix for images/SVGs in PDFs and a mechanism to preserve links.
    *   Extensive state management was added for various report sections and their filters (selected components, periods, start/end dates, media types, competitors).
    *   Numerous asynchronous functions (`getAIgeneratedResponse`, `getSentiPerformanceMetricData`, `getSentiCompAnalysisData`, `getShareOfVoiceChart`, etc.) were introduced to fetch data from a `userService` based on the selected filters.
    *   A `handleSelectAllDD` function was added to set all report sub-components as selected.
    *   Date utility functions (`formatDate`, `handleDateRangeChange`, `calculateDateRange`) were implemented to manage date-based filtering.
    *   A new `SEND_BRAND_REPORT` constant and a `downloadPDFWithLinks` function were added, indicating the implementation of a feature to generate and potentially send reports.

*   **`.env` (11/25/2025, 9:25 PM - 11/26/2025, 11:39 AM):**
    *   This file contains commented-out and active environment variables related to API endpoints and asset storage URLs for development (beta) and production environments.
    *   Key changes involved toggling between `beta.goskribe.com/v1/` and `goskribe.com/v1/` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREFIX_URL_V1`, suggesting a switch between beta and production API environments. Other URLs for image storage, reset passwords, and a "Socion" service were also adjusted between `skribe-media-dev`, `skribe-media-prod`, `beta-app.goskribe.com`, and `beta.socion.in`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/25/2025, 3:45 PM - 3:46 PM:** Rapid iterations on `CatelogReport.jsx` for data handling and rendering logic.
*   **11/25/2025, 3:55 PM:** Introduction of `Sentiment.jsx`.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:32 PM:** Introduction of `SpokePersonReport.jsx`.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:33 PM:** Introduction of `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:36 PM:** Introduction of `Report.jsx`, indicating the aggregation of individual reports. This also marks the initial implementation of PDF generation logic.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:47 PM - 4:49 PM:** Introduction of conditional rendering logic (`catalogSelectedComps.includes(...)`) within `CatelogReport.jsx`.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:50 PM - 4:55 PM:** Introduction of conditional rendering logic (`sentiSelectedComps.includes(...)`) within `Sentiment.jsx`.
*   **11/25/2025, 5:27 PM - 9:10 PM:** A period of intensive work or debugging on `SpokePersonReport.jsx` where the entire component was commented out and subsequently restored and refactored to use dynamic data and conditional rendering.
*   **11/25/2025, 9:25 PM:** Initial log of `.env` file, showing active `beta.goskribe.com` endpoints.
*   **11/26/2025, 9:26 AM:** `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx` starts using props for data.
*   **11/26/2025, 10:25 AM - 10:44 AM:** Major refactoring in `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx` to switch from dummy data to dynamic props for charts and tables. Debugging `console.log` statements are temporarily added and then removed.
*   **11/26/2025, 10:46 AM - 10:54 AM:** Implementation of conditional rendering (`sovSelectedComps.includes(...)`) for various sections of `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`.
*   **11/26/2025, 11:06 AM - 11:10 AM:** Minor styling and text slicing adjustments in `CatelogReport.jsx`.
*   **11/26/2025, 11:20 AM - 11:25 AM:** Introduction of conditional rendering for sections and some styling adjustments in `SpokePersonReport.jsx`.
*   **11/26/2025, 12:13 PM:** `GenerateReport.jsx` adds PDF generation and API call functionality for sending reports, also including axios and token service imports.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **React Components:** All code changes are within React functional components, often using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, though `useEffect` is commented out in some places during refactoring.
*   **Dynamic Imports for Charting Libraries:** `next/dynamic` is consistently used for `react-apexcharts` and `react-d3-speedometer` with `ssr: false` to ensure client-side rendering. This indicates performance optimization for large charting libraries.
*   **Styling with Tailwind CSS (implied):** Class names like `border-b`, `px-4`, `py-3`, `text-black/15`, `text-sm`, `font-medium`, `flex`, `gap-5`, `rounded-lg`, `bg-white`, `text-green-600`, `border-red-500` suggest the use of Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Report Structure:** Each report component (Catalog, Sentiment, Spokesperson, Share of Voice) generally follows a similar structure: a main `<section>` with `pdf-section` class, a header `<h1>` with "Report" in its title, and multiple `div` elements for different metrics or charts, each typically with a white background, rounded corners, and a border.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** A dominant pattern in later changes is the introduction of `selectedComps.includes(...)` checks to conditionally render sections within reports. This suggests a feature where users can customize which parts of a report are included.
*   **Data Handling:** Components are being refactored to accept data via props rather than using hardcoded dummy data, making them more dynamic and reusable. Nullish coalescing (`?.` and `|| 0`) is used extensively for safe data access.
*   **Date Management:** Several utility functions (`formatDate`, `handleDateRangeChange`, `calculateDateRange`) are being implemented in `GenerateReport.jsx` to handle various date period selections, indicating a flexible date filtering mechanism for reports.
*   **API Integration:** The `Report.jsx` file highlights a clear intention to integrate with a backend service (`userService`) to fetch various types of brand data and eventually send generated PDF reports.
*   **Environment Variables:** The `.env` file consistently manages different API and media storage URLs for various deployment stages (beta, prod), demonstrating a robust deployment configuration.

## 2:17:43 PM
The provided log details changes across several JavaScript/React files responsible for generating brand reports and one environment configuration file. The core focus of the changes revolves around refactoring components to dynamically render content based on user selections and improving data handling for report generation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **11/25/2025, 3:43:39 PM - 3:46:44 PM:** Initial development and minor refinements.
        *   The `ArticleCard` component was introduced to display individual articles, including website, title, summary, publish date, and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral with corresponding styling).
        *   The main `CatelogReport` component was created with a title, dummy outlet tags, and a section to list `ArticleCard`s.
        *   Initial data for articles was `dummyArticles`, which was later replaced with `catalogArticles` passed as a prop, indicating a shift towards dynamic data.
        *   Conditional rendering was introduced to show "No Articles Found!" if `catalogArticles` is empty.
        *   An `overflow-y-auto` class was added to the articles container at 3:45:27 PM for scrollability, then removed at 3:46:01 PM.
        *   Optional chaining (`?.`) was added to `article.mtxtarticlesummary` and `article.vchsentiment` for safer property access.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:03:14 PM:** Changed the font size for `article.vchwebsite` from `text-sm` to `text-xs`.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:46:13 PM - 4:49:32 PM:** Enhanced dynamic rendering based on `catalogSelectedComps`.
        *   The `CatelogReport` component now accepts `catalogSelectedComps` as a prop.
        *   The main content of the report (the articles list) is conditionally rendered only if `catalogSelectedComps` includes specific strings like "Media Impact Score (Previous Months)" or "No of Mentions". This indicates an intent to control which sections of the report are visible based on user configuration.
    *   **11/26/2025, 11:06:51 AM - 11:10:33 AM:** Applied `slice(0, 180)` to `article.vchtitle` for truncation and adjusted the text size of `article.vchwebsite` back to `text-sm` from `text-xs`.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **11/25/2025, 3:55:41 PM - 3:58:36 PM:** Focused on displaying sentiment analysis and performance metrics.
        *   Introduced `dynamic` import for `react-apexcharts` for SSR optimization.
        *   The component receives `sentiPerformanceMetricData`, `sentiCompAnalysisData`, and `aiResponse` props.
        *   It displays "AI-generated opinion on Media Impact" (Quick Take section), Performance Metrics (Sentiment Score, Positive, Negative, Neutral percentages with change indicators), and Comparative Analysis using ApexCharts for sentiment distribution.
        *   Minor styling adjustments were made, like changing `h2` font size from `text-lg` to `text-base` and paragraph/list item font sizes from `text-sm` to `text-xs`.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:50:41 PM - 4:55:41 PM:** Implemented conditional rendering for sections based on `sentiSelectedComps`.
        *   The "AI-generated opinion on Media Impact", "Performance Metrics", and "Comparative Analysis" sections are now individually rendered only if specific strings like "AI Insights", "Performance Metrics", or "Comparative Analysis" are present in the `sentiSelectedComps` array. This allows for modular report generation.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:32:18 PM:** Initial implementation of `SpokePersonReport`.
        *   Uses `dynamic` imports for `react-apexcharts` and `react-d3-speedometer`.
        *   Contains several dummy data sets for spokesperson mentions, monthly mention graphs, number of mentions, and sentiment.
        *   Includes a horizontal bar chart for monthly mention count, a speedometer for "No of Mentions" change, a bar chart for "Spokesperson Sentiment Score", and a table for "Top 5 Spokesperson".
    *   **11/25/2025, 5:02:23 PM - 5:03:00 PM:** Props were updated to accept dynamic data: `spokesSelectedComps`, `spokesMentionCountData`, `spokesNoOfMentionsData`, `spokesSentimentData`, `spokesSentimentScore`, `spokesTopPersonsData`.
    *   **11/25/2025, 9:05:54 PM - 9:10:50 PM:** Extensive commenting out of the entire file's content, suggesting a period of refactoring or temporary disabling.
    *   **11/25/2025, 9:12:09 PM:** Reinstatement of the component's logic, now dynamically using the passed props instead of dummy data.
        *   Chart data (`monthlyChartData`, `sentimentChartData`) is now derived from `spokesMentionCountData` and `spokesSentimentData`.
        *   Display values for "No of Mentions" and "Spokesperson Sentiment Score" use the `spokesNoOfMentionsData` and `spokesSentimentScore` props.
        *   The "Top 5 Spokesperson" table now renders data from `spokesTopPersonsData`.
        *   Placeholder for "No Spokespersons Found" added.
        *   Speedometer value extraction logic improved (removing '%' and handling nullish values).
        *   Chart heights adjusted.
    *   **11/25/2025, 9:13:23 PM - 9:22:34 PM:** Conditional rendering based on `spokesSelectedComps` was implemented for different sections of the report (e.g., "Spokesperson Mention Count", "Top 5 Spokesperson").
    *   **11/26/2025, 11:20:55 AM - 11:25:04 AM:** Further refinement of conditional rendering, removing duplicate blocks for "No of Mentions" and "Spokesperson Sentiment Score" to ensure they are rendered once and controlled by their respective `spokesSelectedComps` conditions.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx`**
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:33:00 PM:** Initial implementation.
        *   Includes dummy data for `shareOfVoiceData`, `shareOfVoiceMention`, `shareOfVoiceReach`, `topJournalistsData`, and `topCompetitorJournalistsData`.
        *   Configures various ApexCharts for "Share of Voice", "Share of Voice by Mentions" (pie chart), "Share of Voice by Reach" (pie chart), and "Average Share of Voice" (pie chart).
        *   Renders tables for "Top Journalists (Brand)" and "Top Journalists (Competition)".
    *   **11/26/2025, 9:26:06 AM - 9:29:10 AM:** Props were updated to accept dynamic data: `sovSelectedComps`, `sovChartData`, `sovReachData`, `sovMentionsData`, `sovBrandJournalists`, `sovCompetitorJournalists`. Debugging `console.log` statements were added.
    *   **11/26/2025, 10:25:08 AM - 10:31:31 AM:** Extensive commenting out of the entire file's content, similar to `SpokePersonReport.jsx`, suggesting refactoring or temporary disabling.
    *   **11/26/2025, 10:32:45 AM:** Reinstatement of the component's logic, now dynamically using the passed props instead of dummy data.
        *   All chart data and table data are now derived from the `sov` prefixed props.
        *   Conditional rendering was introduced based on `sovSelectedComps` for the "Share of Voice Chart" and the "Top 5 Journalists" section.
        *   Empty state messages for tables (e.g., "No Journalists Found") were added.
    *   **11/26/2025, 10:44:44 AM - 10:54:11 AM:** Further refinement of conditional rendering, adding individual checks within `sovSelectedComps` for "Share of Voice by Mentions", "Share of Voice by Reach", and "Average Share of Voice" components, and adjusting element positioning using `mb-4` margin bottom.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:36:59 PM:** This file defines the main `Report` component responsible for orchestrating the generation of brand reports.
        *   It imports `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro` for PDF generation, along with other report components (`ShareOfVoiceReport`, `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`).
        *   Defines several `GET` and `POST` API constants for fetching report data (`GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`, `BRAND_AI_INSIGHTS`, etc.).
        *   Includes utility functions `formatDate`, `applyStyle`, and `removeStyle` for PDF generation.
        *   The `downloadPDFWithLinks` asynchronous function is a key part of the functionality, capturing sections of the page into a PDF and preserving hyperlinks.
        *   Initializes numerous `useState` hooks to manage various data points for different report sections (media score, sentiment, share of voice, spokesperson, catalog) and their respective filtering parameters (periods, media types, competitors, dates).
        *   Includes placeholder async functions (`getAIgeneratedResponse`, `getSentiPerformanceMetricData`, etc.) to fetch data for each report section using `userService`. This indicates a setup for future data fetching.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\GenerateReport\GenerateReport.jsx`**
    *   **11/25/2025, 9:22:04 PM:** This file manages the UI and logic for generating reports.
        *   Imports various UI components (`BrandHeader`, `DropdownComponent`, `MultiSelectDropdown`) and hooks (`useLocalStorage`, `useBrandMediaTypes`, `useNotification`).
        *   Defines dropdown options for `periodOptions`, `monthOptions`, and `timePeriodOptions`.
        *   Manages numerous `useState` hooks for dropdown states (`mediaScoreDDOpen`, `sentimentDDOpen`, etc.) and the selected components/filters for each report section (`msSelectedComps`, `sentiSelectedComps`, `sovSelectedComps`, `spokesSelectedComps`, `catalogSelectedComps`).
        *   Includes functions `handleDateRangeChange` and `calculateDateRange` for managing date selections based on predefined periods (Last 24 hours, Last 1 month, Previous month, etc.).
    *   **11/26/2025, 12:13:58 PM:** Significantly enhanced PDF generation and data submission.
        *   Moved `jsPDF`, `html2canvas-pro`, `axios`, and `tokenService` imports to this file, suggesting the PDF generation logic is now handled here.
        *   Integrated the `downloadPDFWithLinks` function (previously defined in `Report.jsx`) into `GenerateReport.jsx`. This function now returns a `blob` and `filename`, indicating that the PDF is generated and then likely intended for upload or further processing, rather than just client-side saving.
        *   Added `SEND_BRAND_REPORT` constant for API interaction.
        *   The `handleSelectAllDD` function was updated to include "Average Share of Voice" in the `sovSelectedComps`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Dynamic Rendering and Conditional Visibility:** A strong pattern is the use of `SelectedComps` arrays (e.g., `msSelectedComps`, `sentiSelectedComps`) to conditionally render different sections or sub-components of a report. This suggests a modular report generation system where users can select which data points or charts they want to include.
2.  **Date Range Management:** There are recurring `useState` hooks and utility functions (`formatDate`, `handleDateRangeChange`, `calculateDateRange`) dedicated to managing start and end dates based on predefined periods (e.g., "Last 1 month", "Previous 3 months", "Custom Date Range"). This indicates a flexible date filtering mechanism for reports.
3.  **Chart Libraries:** `react-apexcharts` is consistently used across `Sentiment.jsx`, `SpokePersonReport.jsx`, and `ShareOfVoiceReport.jsx` for various chart types (bar, line, pie), highlighting a standardized approach to data visualization. `react-d3-speedometer` is also used in `SpokePersonReport.jsx`.
4.  **Data Fetching Structure:** Each report component (or the main `Report.jsx` orchestrator) uses `userService.get` and `userService.post` with specific API endpoints (constants like `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`, `GET_SHARE_OF_VOICE`) to fetch data, suggesting a centralized API service.
5.  **Dummy Data Transition:** Many components initially relied on `dummy...Data` or hardcoded arrays, which were then systematically replaced with props that accept actual fetched data. This reflects a development process moving from mock-ups to integration with backend data.
6.  **UI/Styling Consistency:** The use of Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `bg-[#f5f5f5]`, `rounded-xl`, `border border-[#00000033]`, `text-black/60`, `font-semibold`) is pervasive across all components, indicating a consistent design language.
7.  **PDF Generation for Reports:** The `Report.jsx` and later `GenerateReport.jsx` files show a clear intent to generate downloadable PDF reports using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro`, including functionality to preserve hyperlinks within the generated PDF. The shift of PDF generation logic to `GenerateReport.jsx` implies a more direct control flow for report creation and potential submission.

In summary, the changes reflect the ongoing development of a comprehensive brand reporting tool, focusing on modularity, dynamic data rendering, flexible filtering options, and the capability to generate interactive PDF reports.

## 4:14:02 PM
The log details recent development activities focused on refining reporting components and their data integration, primarily occurring on November 25th and 26th, 2025. A core pattern across the changes is the transition from static, dummy data within individual report components to dynamic data supplied via props from a central `Report.jsx` component. Another prominent pattern is the extensive use of conditional rendering to display specific report sections based on user selections.

Here’s a breakdown of the key information:

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\SpokePersonReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** November 25, 2025, 4:32:18 PM (initial commit), and then a series of updates from 5:02:23 PM to 9:10:50 PM, followed by further refinements on November 26, 2025, from 11:20:55 AM to 11:25:04 AM.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   Initially, the component used hardcoded dummy data for "Spokesperson Mention Count" charts, "No of Mentions" (with a speedometer), "Spokesperson Sentiment Score" chart, and "Top 5 Spokesperson" table.
        *   The component was refactored to accept report data and selected components (`spokesSelectedComps`) as props, enabling dynamic data display.
        *   Specific data points for charts and tables (like `spokesMentionCountData`, `spokesNoOfMentionsData`, `spokesSentimentData`, `spokesSentimentScore`, `spokesTopPersonsData`) are now derived from these props.
        *   Conditional rendering (`spokesSelectedComps.includes(...)`) was implemented for individual sections such as "Spokesperson Mention Count," "No of Mentions," "Spokesperson Sentiment Score," and "Top 5 Spokesperson," allowing them to be shown or hidden based on selection.
        *   Chart heights were adjusted (e.g., Spokesperson Mention Count chart from 180px to 240px, sentiment chart from 150px to 140px), and speedometer width was updated.

    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** November 25, 2025, 4:33:00 PM (initial commit), and then extensive updates on November 26, 2025, from 9:26:06 AM to 10:53:37 AM.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   Started with dummy data for "Share of Voice" charts (bar and pie charts for mentions, reach, and average) and "Top Journalists" tables.
        *   The component was updated to receive dynamic data (`sovChartData`, `sovReachData`, `sovMentionsData`, `sovBrandJournalists`, `sovCompetitorJournalists`) and selected components (`sovSelectedComps`) through props.
        *   Data transformation functions now process the received props for chart series and categories.
        *   Conditional rendering was introduced to display sections like "Share of Voice Chart," "Share of Voice by Mentions," "Share of Voice by Reach," "Average Share of Voice," and "Top 5 Journalists of Brand and Competitors" based on `sovSelectedComps`.
        *   Temporary `console.log` statements for debugging props were added and removed during the process.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Report.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** November 25, 2025, 4:36:59 PM (initial commit), and then further changes on November 26, 2025, starting from 12:13:58 PM to 4:03:57 PM.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   This component acts as the main orchestrator, importing various sub-report components (`ShareOfVoiceReport`, `MediaScore`, `Sentiment`, `SpokePersonReport`, `CatelogReport`).
        *   It manages a multitude of `useState` hooks for report data, selection filters (e.g., `msSelectedComps`, `sentiSelectedComps`), and date ranges for each sub-report.
        *   Includes functions to fetch data from `userService` for various report sections (e.g., `GET_BRAND_SOV_DATA`, `GET_BRAND_SENTIMENT_SCORE`, `SPOKESPERSON_MONTHLY_CHART`, `GET_CATALOG_ARTICLES`), indicating backend integration for report generation.
        *   A `downloadPDFWithLinks` asynchronous function is defined (though later commented out), using `jspdf` and `html2canvas-pro` to generate PDFs from the rendered report sections, including interactive links. This function was briefly re-enabled and then disabled again.
        *   The `handleSelectAllDD` function was updated to select specific components across all report types (Media Score, Sentiment, Share of Voice, Spokesperson, Catalog).
        *   Date range handling logic (`handleDateRangeChange`, `calculateDateRange`) is present to manage time periods for data fetching.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\CatelogReport.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** Multiple changes on November 25, 2025, from 4:46:13 PM to 4:49:32 PM, and then minor updates on November 26, 2025, from 11:06:51 AM to 11:10:33 AM.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   The `ArticleCard` component displays individual article details including publication, title, summary, date, and sentiment, with a "Read more" link.
        *   The main `CatelogReport` component conditionally renders its content based on `catalogSelectedComps.includes("No of Mentions")`.
        *   Minor styling adjustments and truncation for the article title were introduced.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\Sentiment.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** Multiple changes on November 25, 2025, from 4:50:05 PM to 4:55:41 PM.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   The component uses dynamically imported `ReactApexChart` for sentiment analysis.
        *   It was updated to receive `sentiSelectedComps` as a prop.
        *   Conditional rendering was implemented for "AI-generated opinion on Media Impact", "Performance Metrics", and "Comparative Analysis" sections, making them visible based on `sentiSelectedComps` values ("AI Insights", "Performance Metrics", "Comparative Analysis").
        *   Initial incorrect conditional rendering conditions were corrected.

*   **`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Report\MediaScore.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant changes:** November 25, 2025, 4:56:39 PM, and then another change at 4:58:05 PM.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   The component displays "Performance Metrics" (Average Share of Voice, No of Mentions, Sentiment Score) and various charts related to media impact and mentions.
        *   It uses `next/dynamic` for `ReactApexChart` and `Skeleton` for loading states.
        *   Conditional rendering was implemented for "Performance Metrics" and "Media Article Count" (partially shown) sections based on `msSelectedComps.includes("Media Impact Score (Previous Months)")`.
        *   Includes data transformation functions (`transformMediaImpactData`, `transformMediaMentionCountData`) to prepare raw data for charts.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Reporting:** The architecture is built around a main `Report.jsx` component that aggregates and passes data to several specialized sub-report components (Spokesperson, Share of Voice, Sentiment, Media Score, Catalog).
*   **Dynamic Data Integration:** A consistent theme is the shift from hardcoded dummy data to dynamically fetched and prop-driven data for all report components, indicating a move towards a functional, data-driven application.
*   **Conditional Display Logic:** All report components use a `[reportType]SelectedComps.includes("Section Name")` pattern for conditional rendering, suggesting a user interface that allows customization of report content.
*   **Data Visualization:** `ReactApexChart` is heavily utilized across all report components for various chart types (bar, pie, line), emphasizing data visualization as a key feature. `ReactSpeedometer` is used in `SpokePersonReport`.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Tailwind CSS-like utility classes are consistently applied for layout, spacing, colors, and typography across all report components, ensuring a uniform look and feel.
*   **PDF Generation Capability:** The `Report.jsx` component explicitly contains (though sometimes commented out) `jsPDF` and `html2canvas-pro` integration for generating downloadable PDF reports with links, highlighting a core functionality.
*   **Timestamp Concentration:** All recorded changes are clustered within two consecutive days (November 25-26, 2025), indicating intensive development or a release sprint.
