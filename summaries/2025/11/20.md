# Activity Summary for 11/20/2025

## 10:18:58 AM
For the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\SKRIBE NEW FRONT_END\skribefrontend\src\components\Brand\Overview\Overview.jsx`, two entries are provided with timestamps 11/20/2025, 10:04:21 AM and 11/20/2025, 10:11:41 AM.

The key observation is that the entire content of the `Overview.jsx` file is commented out (`//` prefix on every line) in both logged instances. There are no functional code changes between the two timestamps. This suggests that the component's logic, including state management (`useState`, `useEffect`), data fetching (`userService.get` for brand impact, SOV, mentions, and sentiment scores), UI rendering for performance metrics, and dropdowns for graph and media type selection, was completely disabled or temporarily excluded from execution at these specific times. The component relies on several sub-components like `BrandHeader`, `Spokesperson`, `MediaArticleCount`, `AIGeneratedOpinion`, `QualityOfMentionsSplit`, `DropdownComponent`, `MediaMentionsChart`, `MonthlyMentionChart`, and `MultiSelectDropdown`, along with custom hooks `useBrandMediaTypes` and `useLocalStorage`. It also fetches data from various API endpoints defined in `constants`. The presence of skeleton loaders (`react-loading-skeleton`) suggests an attempt to handle loading states for data display.

The pattern observed is a complete commenting out of the file's content, which remains consistent across the two closely spaced timestamps. This indicates either a prolonged period where the component was intentionally inactive, or the logging captured the state of the file while it was being commented out or was already commented out, without any active code modifications between the captured points.
