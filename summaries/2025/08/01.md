# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 10:40:59 AM
The MONTHLY_2.html file was updated on 8/1/2025, 9:41:03 AM.  The changes primarily involved a redesign of the email header, replacing an older `mailerHeader.png` with `mailerHeader1.png`. The new header includes styling adjustments for the logo (`logo.png`). The content remains largely the same, focusing on Skribe's monthly digest, highlighting new features (Press Release Distribution and Regional Vernacular Tracking), a key event (IDMA 2025), Journalist of the Month, key appointments and industry updates.  The email uses consistent styling throughout, employing specific fonts ('proxima-nova', 'Montserrat') and color schemes (#002B5B, #0A4C86, white, black).  The updated code features improved responsiveness and uses inline styles extensively within the HTML table structure.  There's also a call to action promoting Skribe's paid press release distribution service.

The log shows multiple edits to `SelectPopup.jsx` between 10:43 AM and 11:43 AM on August 1st, 2025.  The component is a popup with a close button, radio buttons for "Agency" and "Enterprise" selections, and a submit button.  The initial version had some inconsistencies in spacing (`mt-8`, `mt-6`, `mt-4` variations) which were largely standardized to `mt-6` and `mt-4` in later versions.

Early edits focused on minor adjustments to the spacing and margins within the popup.  Around 11:12 AM, a "person_add" icon was added using Material Icons, initially without styling, and subsequently styled with gray color and hover effects.  The icon's font size was also adjusted multiple times, eventually settling on `70px`.  The `shadow` property of the main element was changed from `shadow-2xl` to `shadow-4xl` .

A more significant change occurred around 11:39 AM. The title of the popup was changed from "Choose Between These Two Options" to "Signup for Socion (Account)".  This suggests a shift in the popup's functionality or purpose.  The `gap` property of the radio button container changed from `gap-8` to `gap-x-4`. Additionally, the padding of the main element changed from `p-9` to `px-12 py-9`.  The final version uses consistent spacing and styling for the icon and maintains the new title and functionality.
