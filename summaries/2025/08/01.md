# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 10:40:59 AM
The MONTHLY_2.html file was updated on 8/1/2025, 9:41:03 AM.  The changes primarily involved a redesign of the email header, replacing an older `mailerHeader.png` with `mailerHeader1.png`. The new header includes styling adjustments for the logo (`logo.png`). The content remains largely the same, focusing on Skribe's monthly digest, highlighting new features (Press Release Distribution and Regional Vernacular Tracking), a key event (IDMA 2025), Journalist of the Month, key appointments and industry updates.  The email uses consistent styling throughout, employing specific fonts ('proxima-nova', 'Montserrat') and color schemes (#002B5B, #0A4C86, white, black).  The updated code features improved responsiveness and uses inline styles extensively within the HTML table structure.  There's also a call to action promoting Skribe's paid press release distribution service.
