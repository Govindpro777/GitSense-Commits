# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 10:40:59 AM
The MONTHLY_2.html file was updated on 8/1/2025, 9:41:03 AM.  The changes primarily involved a redesign of the email header, replacing an older `mailerHeader.png` with `mailerHeader1.png`. The new header includes styling adjustments for the logo (`logo.png`). The content remains largely the same, focusing on Skribe's monthly digest, highlighting new features (Press Release Distribution and Regional Vernacular Tracking), a key event (IDMA 2025), Journalist of the Month, key appointments and industry updates.  The email uses consistent styling throughout, employing specific fonts ('proxima-nova', 'Montserrat') and color schemes (#002B5B, #0A4C86, white, black).  The updated code features improved responsiveness and uses inline styles extensively within the HTML table structure.  There's also a call to action promoting Skribe's paid press release distribution service.


## 11:45:50 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `SelectPopup.jsx` between 10:43 AM and 11:43 AM on August 1st, 2025.  The component is a popup with a close button, radio buttons for "Agency" and "Enterprise" selections, and a submit button.  The initial version had some inconsistencies in spacing (`mt-8`, `mt-6`, `mt-4` variations) which were largely standardized to `mt-6` and `mt-4` in later versions.

Early edits focused on minor adjustments to the spacing and margins within the popup.  Around 11:12 AM, a "person_add" icon was added using Material Icons, initially without styling, and subsequently styled with gray color and hover effects.  The icon's font size was also adjusted multiple times, eventually settling on `70px`.  The `shadow` property of the main element was changed from `shadow-2xl` to `shadow-4xl` .

A more significant change occurred around 11:39 AM. The title of the popup was changed from "Choose Between These Two Options" to "Signup for Socion (Account)".  This suggests a shift in the popup's functionality or purpose.  The `gap` property of the radio button container changed from `gap-8` to `gap-x-4`. Additionally, the padding of the main element changed from `p-9` to `px-12 py-9`.  The final version uses consistent spacing and styling for the icon and maintains the new title and functionality.


## 12:45:42 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `Header.jsx` between 11:54 AM and 11:55 AM on August 1st, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor and don't change the overall functionality of the component.  The code involves a React component for a website header, handling user authentication, tracking, and displaying announcements.  It uses various services (`userService`, `tokenService`, `auth.service`) for API calls.  There is extensive use of `useEffect` hooks for managing state and side effects, including handling online/offline status and tracking page visits.  A significant portion of the code is commented out, suggesting potential features under development or removed functionality (e.g., Google Analytics integration).  The `mainNav` array defines navigation links, currently showing only "Home" and "MyCRM" are active.

A `SelectPopup.jsx` component was also updated twice, at 12:27 PM and 12:28 PM on August 1st, 2025. The changes are minimal, likely stylistic or minor bug fixes. The component renders a popup with radio buttons for "Agency" and "Enterprise" options, suggesting a user signup or account selection feature.  The key addition in the second revision is the use of `useEffect` to manage body scroll, disabling it while the popup is open and re-enabling it when closed.


## 1:08:32 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `Header.jsx` and `SelectPopup.jsx` components between 11:31 AM and 12:29 PM on August 1st, 2025.  The `Header.jsx` component underwent several iterations, primarily focusing on the implementation of a "Go to Skribe" button and a signup/login flow conditional on user role.  Initially, this button was rendered within a conditional statement based on user role. Later versions modified the button's appearance, added an onClick handler for tracking data using `sendTrackingData`, and finally introduced a `SelectPopup` component for handling the signup process, removing the direct link to the signup page for certain user roles. The `SelectPopup` component itself was initially created and underwent several revisions.  Changes included modifications to the heading ("Signup for Socion Account" to "Signup for Skribe Account"), text alignment, and the addition of a `useEffect` hook in the final version to manage body overflow during popup display.  A notable change in `Header.jsx` at 11:51:07 AM involved replacing "Go to Skribe" with "Test" in the button text.  The most significant changes, involving the addition of the `SelectPopup` component and its associated state management in `Header.jsx`, occurred between 11:44 AM and 11:51 AM.  The `SelectPopup` component, created at 11:45 AM, represents a relatively stable element, receiving primarily minor styling and text updates throughout the log.
