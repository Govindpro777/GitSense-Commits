# Activity Summary for 8/19/2025

## 10:15:32 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `Summary.jsx` between 9:16 AM and 9:18 AM, with minor code changes in each revision.  These changes appear to be related to refinements or bug fixes rather than substantial feature additions.  The component fetches and displays campaign data, allowing filtering by status ("All", "Draft", "Active"), date range, and search term.  It includes features like infinite scrolling and debounced search.  There's also tracking data being sent on component mount and when a user clicks "Create New Campaign".  The campaign status is dynamically determined based on `isSent`, `sentDate`, and `scheduledDate` fields.

At 9:18:47 AM, `MailSent.jsx` was updated.  This component displays a "Mail Sent" or "Mail Scheduled" message after a campaign email action. It allows the user to return to the shortlist or proceed to a summary.  The ability to go back to shortlisting is disabled if all 30 shortlisted creators have been engaged or if the mail is scheduled.

Finally, at 9:19:20 AM, `Insights.jsx` was modified.  This component displays campaign insights, including data for online and offline engaged creators. It features functionality to add or remove creators, add deliverables, and filter by search terms.  The component also handles updating draft types and redirects to appropriate pages (Shortlist or Discover).  The user's `agencyName` is included when adding creators to engaged influencers. Error handling is implemented throughout to manage various API response statuses and display notifications to the user using a `useNotification` hook.  A breadcrumb display is conditionally controlled based on query parameters.


## 11:11:00 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `api.ts` and one revision to `config.ts` between 10:17 AM and 10:25 AM on August 19, 2025.  The `api.ts` file underwent several changes primarily focused on the base URL used for API requests.  Initially, the code contained commented-out base URLs for localhost, beta, and production environments, and used a dynamically determined URL via `getBaseURL()`.  Between 10:17 AM and 10:19 AM, there were minor formatting changes in `api.ts` (double quotes vs single quotes).  At 10:18 AM, the baseURL was explicitly set to `https://localhost:44323/v1`, overriding the dynamic approach. This was likely a switch to a local development environment.  Later, at 10:19 AM and again at 10:25 AM, the  `baseURL` was changed to `https://beta.goskribe.com/API/v1`, suggesting a shift to the beta environment. The `config.ts` file, updated at 10:19 AM, defines a function `getBaseURL` that selects the base URL based on the environment (development, test, or production) using Vite's `import.meta.env.MODE`.  This function's creation explains the earlier commented-out URLs in `api.ts`, which were replaced by dynamic URL fetching.  The core functionality of `api.ts`, which handles token refresh and error handling, remained unchanged throughout all revisions.


## 1:23:36 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `constants.js` file, primarily focused on defining numerous API endpoints.  These endpoints appear to cover various functionalities, including authentication, user preferences, reporting, campaign management, CRM interactions, and blog-related operations.  The updates to `constants.js`  occurred between 10:51 AM and 11:37 AM with minor updates after that time. There are no discernible patterns in the API endpoint naming conventions beyond their categorization by functionality.

The `Hero.jsx` and `Hero2.jsx` files both underwent significant revisions.  Initially, `Hero.jsx` contained statically defined blog categories and search functionality, all hardcoded.  Between 11:00 AM and 11:10 AM, this component was refactored into `Hero2.jsx` to fetch blog categories dynamically using the `userService` and the newly defined `GET_BLOGS_CATEGORY` constant from `constants.js`. Error handling and loading states were also added to this component between 11:00 AM and 11:30 AM.  Further modifications to `Hero2.jsx`  introduced a carousel for featured blogs, utilizing the `GET_FEATURED_BLOGS` constant, and pagination to fetch all blogs (`GET_ALL_BLOGS`) progressively, making the blog component much more dynamic.  A significant amount of time was spent working on `Hero2.jsx` from 11:11 AM to 1:17 PM.

Finally, the `BlogDetails.jsx` file was updated to `BlogDetails2.jsx` , which now incorporates a more robust approach to fetching and displaying blog details, dynamically pulling data via API calls using `GET_BLOGS_BYID` and showing related blogs using `GET_ALL_BLOGS`.  The `BlogDetails2.jsx` file received updates focused on error handling, loading states, and a more sophisticated approach to handling and rendering HTML content safely, using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. This process happened between 12:11 PM and 1:08 PM. The final versions of `BlogDetails2.jsx` and `Hero2.jsx` include improved error handling and loading states, enhancing the user experience.  The `Blog.jsx` file simply switches between using the original `Hero` and the revised `Hero2` components to display different versions of the blog page, suggesting an A/B testing or iterative development strategy.


## 2:23:36 PM
The log shows multiple updates to three files between 1:25 PM and 2:10 PM on August 19, 2025.

`Hero2.jsx`: This component underwent several revisions.  The initial version (1:25 PM) was heavily commented out.  Subsequent updates (1:26 PM, 2:05 PM, 2:10 PM) progressively added functionality and removed comments.  Key changes include:

* **API Calls:** The component makes API calls to fetch blog categories, featured blogs, and all blogs using a `userService`.  Error handling and loading states are implemented. The API calls use pagination for fetching all blogs. The category filtering logic was significantly improved in later revisions(1:26 PM onwards)  to correctly filter blogs based on the selected category.
* **Blog Display:** The code renders a carousel of featured blogs with previous and next buttons and pagination dots.  If no featured blogs are available, a placeholder message is displayed.  There's also a section to display all blogs which is filtered by category and search term. Error handling for API calls is implemented.
* **UI Improvements:**  The 2:05 PM and 2:10 PM versions integrated links within the featured blog carousel, directly navigating to blog details pages.  The `onError` handler for images was updated from `e.target.src` to `e.currentTarget.src`  in the 2:05 PM and 2:10 PM versions.

`BlogDetails2.jsx`: This component displays individual blog details. Updates at 1:27 PM and 1:41 PM show primarily UI enhancements and refinements. The most notable change is the removal of `className="transition-shadow hover:shadow-md"` in the 1:41 PM update from the related blogs link. 

* **API Calls:** It fetches blog data by ID and related blogs using  `userService` and  `GET_BLOGS_BYID`, `GET_ALL_BLOGS` respectively. Error handling and loading states are implemented.
* **Data Display:** The component displays the blog's title, author, date, image (with fallback), body (using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), and a link to the Skribe Twitter page.  A related blogs section is shown, which displays a maximum of two related blogs.
* **Loading and Error States:**  Loading and error states are included to enhance user experience.

`globals.css`: This file received multiple minor updates between 1:31 PM and 1:38 PM,  all appearing to be stylistic changes and additions of CSS rules for various components and states, not affecting core functionality.  There are many commented-out sections. The changes across these timestamps are so minor that they are difficult to summarize.  The most significant pattern is the consistent use of the `"Poppins"` font family and the color `#01438d`.

The repeated updates to `globals.css` suggest iterative styling adjustments throughout the period, while `Hero2.jsx` and `BlogDetails2.jsx` show more substantial functional changes, particularly around API calls and UI improvements to the blog display.  The multiple updates in a short time span indicate an active development session focusing on blog functionality and presentation.


## 3:10:58 PM
The log shows two entries for the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts`.  Both entries are identical, representing the same code. The timestamps indicate the code was recorded at 3:03:32 PM and 3:06:30 PM on August 19th, 2025.  The file contains code for an axios instance with request and response interceptors.  The interceptors handle token refresh and error scenarios (like network errors and 401 Unauthorized responses), using `TokenService` for token management and `Alert` component for displaying messages.  The base URL for the API is configurable, with options for localhost, beta, and production environments commented out.  The code attempts to automatically refresh access tokens upon receiving a 401 status code.  No significant changes occurred between the two recorded versions.


## 3:23:31 PM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `Hero2.jsx` and `BlogDetails2.jsx`, both related to a blog section of a website.  The changes span from 2:25 PM to 3:01 PM on August 19, 2025.

**`Hero2.jsx` (Blog Homepage Hero Section):**

The component displays featured blog posts in a carousel.  Initial versions involved fetching blog categories, featured blogs, and all blogs using `userService.get` with various API endpoints (`GET_BLOGS_CATEGORY`, `GET_FEATURED_BLOGS`, `GET_ALL_BLOGS`).  The component uses loading and error states for better user experience.  There's a search functionality and category filtering.  A significant change around 2:50 PM introduced a `categoryMap` state to efficiently map category names to IDs, eliminating client-side filtering and improving performance. Several versions were commented out, indicating an iterative development process. The final version uses the category ID in API calls, leading to cleaner code.


**`BlogDetails2.jsx` (Individual Blog Post Details):**

This component displays details of a specific blog post.  It fetches blog data by ID using `GET_BLOGS_BYID` and related blogs based on category using `GET_ALL_BLOGS`. Initially, related blogs were fetched irrespective of category. The major update at around 2:33 PM changed the `fetchRelatedBlogs` function to accept and utilize the blog's `categoryId` for fetching related posts. This improves the relevance of related blog suggestions. Minor stylistic updates to the layout, specifically the spacing around the blog category and related blogs sections, were implemented between 2:58 PM and 3:01 PM. The `h3` tag for "related blogs" was changed to `h3` then changed to `h3` showing an iterative style change.


**Recurring Patterns:**

* **Error Handling:** Both components consistently implement error handling using `try...catch...finally` blocks to manage API requests.
* **Loading States:** Loading states (`loading`, `featuredLoading`, `relatedLoading`) are used to provide feedback to the user during API calls.
* **Data Fetching:**  The `userService.get` function is used extensively for making API calls.
* **Conditional Rendering:**  Conditional rendering based on loading states and the presence of data is used throughout both components for a smoother user experience.
* **Image Handling:** Both components include error handling for image loading (`onError` prop).
* **Helper Functions:** Reusable helper functions such as `formatDate`, `stripHtmlTags`, and `getExcerpt` are defined to handle data formatting and processing.

The overall pattern suggests a well-structured approach to building React components that efficiently fetch and display data from APIs, along with robust error handling and user-experience considerations.  The later commits in the log show a focus on refining functionality and efficiency.


## 4:23:33 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to two React component files (`BlogDetails2.jsx` and `Hero2.jsx`) and one constants file (`constants.js`) between 3:24 PM and 4:05 PM on August 19, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the blog display and functionality.


**`BlogDetails2.jsx` Updates:**

* **Initial Version (3:24 PM):**  This version fetches blog details by ID and related blogs by category ID using `userService.get`.  It includes loading and error states, displays blog content with image handling and error fallback, and renders related blogs with loading and no-blogs-found states. The date is formatted using a helper function.

* **Subsequent Revisions (3:25 PM - 3:36 PM):** Several commits removed the `headers` object from the `userService.get` calls, simplifying the API calls. There were no significant functional changes.

* **Featured Blog Indication (3:35 PM - 3:36 PM):**  A small change was introduced to display "FEATURED" for featured blogs. The `blog.categories` array was modified to only check `blog.isFeatured`.

* **Back Button Added (4:01 PM - 4:04 PM):** A "Go Back" button using `router.back()` was added to allow users to navigate back to the previous page. The button's styling was slightly adjusted across multiple commits.

* **Final `BlogDetails2.jsx` (4:04 PM):** Includes the back button and uses `next/navigation`'s `useRouter` hook for navigation. Image paths are now consistently prepended with `IMAGEPATH` from `constants.js`.


**`Hero2.jsx` Updates:**

* **Initial Version (3:30 PM):** This component fetches blog categories, featured blogs, and a paginated list of all blogs. It implements a carousel for featured blogs with auto-sliding functionality.  Category filtering and search functionality are included, with loading and error handling.

* **API Call Simplification (3:31 PM - 3:33 PM):** Similar to `BlogDetails2.jsx`,  several commits removed the `headers` object from `userService.get` calls in the API fetching functions.

* **Console Log Removed (3:33 PM):**  A debug `console.log` statement in `handleCategoryChange` was removed.

* **Search Result Display (3:39 PM - 3:40 PM):**  Improved the display of search results to show total results from pagination (`pagination.totalResult`) instead of just the number of blogs currently displayed (`allBlogs.length`).

* **Final `Hero2.jsx` (4:05 PM):** Image paths are now consistently prepended with `IMAGEPATH` from `constants.js`


**`constants.js` Updates:**

* **IMAGEPATH Added (3:54 PM):**  An `IMAGEPATH` constant is added to centralize image path management, used in both `BlogDetails2.jsx` and `Hero2.jsx`.
* **Minor Revisions (3:52 PM, 3:53 PM):** No significant changes are noted in the  `constants.js` file, other than potential formatting or comment adjustments.



**Recurring Elements:**

* The consistent use of `userService.get` for API calls across all components.
* Extensive use of loading and error handling mechanisms in each API call function.
* The use of helper functions to format dates and strip HTML tags.
* The `IMAGEPATH` constant was added to centralize image paths.


The overall pattern indicates a focus on improving the user experience of the blog section by improving the look of the featured blog and blog details page by adding a back button.  The numerous small commits suggest iterative development and debugging.
