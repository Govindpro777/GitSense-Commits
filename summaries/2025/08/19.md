# Activity Summary for 8/19/2025

## 10:15:32 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `Summary.jsx` between 9:16 AM and 9:18 AM, with minor code changes in each revision.  These changes appear to be related to refinements or bug fixes rather than substantial feature additions.  The component fetches and displays campaign data, allowing filtering by status ("All", "Draft", "Active"), date range, and search term.  It includes features like infinite scrolling and debounced search.  There's also tracking data being sent on component mount and when a user clicks "Create New Campaign".  The campaign status is dynamically determined based on `isSent`, `sentDate`, and `scheduledDate` fields.

At 9:18:47 AM, `MailSent.jsx` was updated.  This component displays a "Mail Sent" or "Mail Scheduled" message after a campaign email action. It allows the user to return to the shortlist or proceed to a summary.  The ability to go back to shortlisting is disabled if all 30 shortlisted creators have been engaged or if the mail is scheduled.

Finally, at 9:19:20 AM, `Insights.jsx` was modified.  This component displays campaign insights, including data for online and offline engaged creators. It features functionality to add or remove creators, add deliverables, and filter by search terms.  The component also handles updating draft types and redirects to appropriate pages (Shortlist or Discover).  The user's `agencyName` is included when adding creators to engaged influencers. Error handling is implemented throughout to manage various API response statuses and display notifications to the user using a `useNotification` hook.  A breadcrumb display is conditionally controlled based on query parameters.


## 11:11:00 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `api.ts` and one revision to `config.ts` between 10:17 AM and 10:25 AM on August 19, 2025.  The `api.ts` file underwent several changes primarily focused on the base URL used for API requests.  Initially, the code contained commented-out base URLs for localhost, beta, and production environments, and used a dynamically determined URL via `getBaseURL()`.  Between 10:17 AM and 10:19 AM, there were minor formatting changes in `api.ts` (double quotes vs single quotes).  At 10:18 AM, the baseURL was explicitly set to `https://localhost:44323/v1`, overriding the dynamic approach. This was likely a switch to a local development environment.  Later, at 10:19 AM and again at 10:25 AM, the  `baseURL` was changed to `https://beta.goskribe.com/API/v1`, suggesting a shift to the beta environment. The `config.ts` file, updated at 10:19 AM, defines a function `getBaseURL` that selects the base URL based on the environment (development, test, or production) using Vite's `import.meta.env.MODE`.  This function's creation explains the earlier commented-out URLs in `api.ts`, which were replaced by dynamic URL fetching.  The core functionality of `api.ts`, which handles token refresh and error handling, remained unchanged throughout all revisions.
