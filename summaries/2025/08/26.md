# Activity Summary for 8/26/2025

## 10:12:22 AM
The log shows changes primarily focused on the `Login.tsx` file within the `Wheelyfix-Automotive_Admin` directory.  There were multiple revisions of this file between 9:44:03 AM and 9:54:11 AM on August 26, 2025.  These revisions involved a significant refactor of the login functionality.  The initial versions used an `api` object for making requests (likely a custom API client), while later versions switched to using the native `fetch` API.  A key change was the introduction of  `import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL`  to dynamically fetch the backend URL, initially commented out and later included. The final version reverted to the commented-out code, reverting the fetch calls to use the earlier `api` object approach.  The commented-out code in `Login.tsx` shows attempts to improve the login process by using the fetch API and environment variables for backend URL configuration. The `Wheelyfix-Automotive_Admin\.env` file was updated at 9:42:13 AM to set the `BACKEND_URL` to `http://localhost:5000`, indicating a connection to a backend server running on that address.  This appears to have been attempted to be used in conjunction with the `Login.tsx` file refactoring.
