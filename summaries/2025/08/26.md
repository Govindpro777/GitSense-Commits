# Activity Summary for 8/26/2025

## 10:12:22 AM
The log shows changes primarily focused on the `Login.tsx` file within the `Wheelyfix-Automotive_Admin` directory.  There were multiple revisions of this file between 9:44:03 AM and 9:54:11 AM on August 26, 2025.  These revisions involved a significant refactor of the login functionality.  The initial versions used an `api` object for making requests (likely a custom API client), while later versions switched to using the native `fetch` API.  A key change was the introduction of  `import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL`  to dynamically fetch the backend URL, initially commented out and later included. The final version reverted to the commented-out code, reverting the fetch calls to use the earlier `api` object approach.  The commented-out code in `Login.tsx` shows attempts to improve the login process by using the fetch API and environment variables for backend URL configuration. The `Wheelyfix-Automotive_Admin\.env` file was updated at 9:42:13 AM to set the `BACKEND_URL` to `http://localhost:5000`, indicating a connection to a backend server running on that address.  This appears to have been attempted to be used in conjunction with the `Login.tsx` file refactoring.


## 10:12:26 AM
The log shows multiple edits to two HTML files, `Skribe2.html` and `Skribe1.html`, between August 25th and 26th, 2025.  `Skribe2.html` underwent several revisions within a short time frame (10:53 PM to 10:55 PM on August 25th), with no substantial changes detected between the different versions.  The file appears to be an email template focusing on a "Smart Media Strategy," presenting "Paid Distribution" and "Organic Articles" as service options, and comparing them based on turnaround time, credibility, SEO value, and cost.

`Skribe1.html`, a different email template, shows a more significant change between August 25th (10:56 PM) and August 26th (9:13 AM to 9:16 AM). The primary modification in `Skribe1.html` is the replacement of an image source (`https://ucarecdn.com/598a5fb8-42b0-414e-8b6d-39c0a332a581/rightarrow.png`) with `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/right-arrow.png` in the "Choose What Works For You" section.  Additionally, minor adjustments to image padding were made in this section across multiple revisions. This file is also an email template, focusing on "Complete Media Coverage Solutions," with a similar structure to `Skribe2.html`, but with different content and emphasis. Both templates promote a "special offer" of a free consultation.


## 11:12:22 AM
The log shows modifications to two HTML files, `Skribe1.html` and `Skribe2.html`, between 11:01 AM and 11:03 AM on August 26, 2025.  Both files are email templates, focusing on media coverage solutions offered by Skribe.

`Skribe1.html` underwent changes at 11:01:20 AM and 11:03:48 AM.  The initial version and the final version appear identical in this log based on the provided snippets.


`Skribe2.html` was modified at 11:01:39 AM and 11:03:04 AM.  Again,  the provided snippets for both timestamps are identical.  Both versions present a comparison of "Paid Distribution" and "Organic Articles" services, highlighting their respective benefits (turnaround time, credibility, SEO value, and cost).  The consistent use of tables for layout and similar styling across sections is a recurring pattern.  Both files employ a visually consistent design with a similar color scheme and font.  The content differences are subtle and may lie beyond the shown snippets.


## 2:16:52 PM
The log shows several code modifications across multiple files within a React application, likely part of a backend system.  The most significant changes revolve around API calls and routing.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts`**: This file, containing the Axios API client, underwent multiple revisions between 1:17 PM and 1:36 PM. The core functionality remained consistent:  handling access token refreshing using interceptors.  Changes involved:

* **Base URL adjustments**: The `baseURL` for API requests was initially set to `https://beta.goskribe.com/API/v1`, with comments indicating possible alternatives (`localhost` and `www.goskribe.com`). A later change introduced `getBaseURL()` from the `config` file, dynamically selecting the base URL based on the environment. A `pythonBaseURL` was added briefly. This points to a potential integration with a Python backend.
* **Error Handling Improvements**:  The response interceptor was improved to display user-friendly network error messages using the `Alert` component instead of a simple `alert`.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\config.ts`**: This file defines base URLs for different environments (development, test, production).  There were no code changes between the two logs for this file; it appears to be consistently defining the environment-specific URLs.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\components\Layouts\Sidebar.tsx`**: This file, representing a sidebar component,  saw several edits between 1:26 PM and 1:36 PM.  The changes were likely minor formatting or refactoring adjustments as the code remains largely the same throughout the log entries for this file,  which is a React component rendering a navigation sidebar with various menu items.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\ArticleInjestion\ArticleInjestion.jsx`**:  This is a simple component with placeholder content, initially containing only "sfdjhbdshj".

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\pages\ArticleInjestion\ArticleInjestion.tsx`**:  A substantial component was added between 1:38 PM and 1:48 PM. This component handles CSV file uploads for article ingestion. It features:

* **File Upload:** Uses a form to upload CSV files.
* **Error Handling:** Provides alerts for invalid file types and upload failures.
* **Backend Communication:** Sends the file to a Python backend (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/csv-to-array/pandas`) using `fetch`.
* **Data Display:** Displays upload results (total records, inserted records) and the processed data in a table.
* **Mock Data:** Includes a mock data option for testing without a connected Python backend.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\router\routes.tsx`**: This routing configuration file was updated several times between 1:39 PM and 1:41 PM.  The main change was the addition of several new routes, suggesting the addition of new features or pages to the application, notably related to blog posts (`/Blog/AddBlog`, `/Blog/List`, `/Blog/BlogDetails`). The enum `Roles`  was also added, indicating potential role-based access control in the application.


In summary, the code changes reflect an ongoing development process, focusing on refining API interaction, adding a new article ingestion feature using a Python backend, and expanding the application's functionality with new routes and pages.  The `ArticleIngestion` component is a major addition, and the updates to the API handling demonstrate a shift toward more robust error management and a dynamic base URL for improved deployment flexibility.


## 3:12:20 PM
The log shows a single entry for `Skribe2.html` created on August 26, 2025, at 2:32:26 PM.  This file is an HTML email template designed to compare "Paid Distribution" and "Organic Articles" marketing strategies.  The email features a visually appealing design with a gradient background, uses nested tables for layout, and includes images (logos and checkmarks).  The content highlights the key differences between the two approaches, focusing on turnaround time, credibility, SEO value, and cost.  Both sections use a consistent visual style with headings, bullet points, and a similar color palette. The code employs inline CSS for styling.


## 3:33:41 PM
The log shows several email template updates for Socion, all within a short timeframe on August 26, 2025.  The files are all HTML email templates,  using a consistent structure based on nested tables for layout.  All templates employ similar styling, including the use of the "Inter" and "Source Sans 3" Google fonts and consistent color schemes (#FBF0D9, #FEA854, #E86D70, etc.).  They also include a consistent footer with social media links and a "Powered by: skribe" attribution.

The `Campaign Insights.html` file had its title changed from "Incomplete Onboarding" to "Campaign Insights" in a minor update between 2:33:55 PM and 2:34:08 PM.  The content remained largely the same.

The `Feature Nudge.html` file shows two versions. The first (2:34:25 PM)  focuses on encouraging users to try the outreach feature after discovering influencers. The second version (2:39:22 PM) has a slightly altered heading in the "Better insights section", changing the emphasis from partnership building to urging users to "take the next step".  The progress bar in the top right corner was toggled on and off between the two versions.

The `Incomplete Onboarding.html` file (2:34:44 PM) is an onboarding email focusing on guiding users through account setup, highlighting features such as influencer search filters.

The `socion4.html` (2:35:02 PM) is a weekly activity recap email, displaying the number of discovered influencers, launched campaigns, and created shortlists using placeholder values [X], [Y], and [Z].  The progress bar was removed from this version.

The `Mid-Trial Reminder + Feedback Pulse.html` (2:35:53 PM) is a mid-trial reminder email prompting users to complete their trial by exploring features and providing feedback. The progress bar was removed from this version.

The `socion6.html` and `Trial Expired.html` files (2:36:13 PM and 2:36:39 PM, respectively) are focused on trial expiry.  `socion6.html` urges users to upgrade before the trial ends with a 15% discount. `Trial Expired.html` informs users their trial has ended and offers the same 15% discount to reactivate.  Both emails feature altered header images compared to the other templates.

Finally, `socion8.html` (2:36:54 PM) is a post-trial thank-you email that requests feedback. A similar header image as `Trial Expired.html` is used.

A recurring theme across the emails is encouraging user engagement and conversion through feature nudges and trial upgrade promotions (specifically a 15% discount).  The consistent design elements suggest a cohesive brand identity.
