# Activity Summary for 8/26/2025

## 10:12:22 AM
The log shows changes primarily focused on the `Login.tsx` file within the `Wheelyfix-Automotive_Admin` directory.  There were multiple revisions of this file between 9:44:03 AM and 9:54:11 AM on August 26, 2025.  These revisions involved a significant refactor of the login functionality.  The initial versions used an `api` object for making requests (likely a custom API client), while later versions switched to using the native `fetch` API.  A key change was the introduction of  `import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL`  to dynamically fetch the backend URL, initially commented out and later included. The final version reverted to the commented-out code, reverting the fetch calls to use the earlier `api` object approach.  The commented-out code in `Login.tsx` shows attempts to improve the login process by using the fetch API and environment variables for backend URL configuration. The `Wheelyfix-Automotive_Admin\.env` file was updated at 9:42:13 AM to set the `BACKEND_URL` to `http://localhost:5000`, indicating a connection to a backend server running on that address.  This appears to have been attempted to be used in conjunction with the `Login.tsx` file refactoring.


## 10:12:26 AM
The log shows multiple edits to two HTML files, `Skribe2.html` and `Skribe1.html`, between August 25th and 26th, 2025.  `Skribe2.html` underwent several revisions within a short time frame (10:53 PM to 10:55 PM on August 25th), with no substantial changes detected between the different versions.  The file appears to be an email template focusing on a "Smart Media Strategy," presenting "Paid Distribution" and "Organic Articles" as service options, and comparing them based on turnaround time, credibility, SEO value, and cost.

`Skribe1.html`, a different email template, shows a more significant change between August 25th (10:56 PM) and August 26th (9:13 AM to 9:16 AM). The primary modification in `Skribe1.html` is the replacement of an image source (`https://ucarecdn.com/598a5fb8-42b0-414e-8b6d-39c0a332a581/rightarrow.png`) with `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/right-arrow.png` in the "Choose What Works For You" section.  Additionally, minor adjustments to image padding were made in this section across multiple revisions. This file is also an email template, focusing on "Complete Media Coverage Solutions," with a similar structure to `Skribe2.html`, but with different content and emphasis. Both templates promote a "special offer" of a free consultation.


## 11:12:22 AM
The log shows modifications to two HTML files, `Skribe1.html` and `Skribe2.html`, between 11:01 AM and 11:03 AM on August 26, 2025.  Both files are email templates, focusing on media coverage solutions offered by Skribe.

`Skribe1.html` underwent changes at 11:01:20 AM and 11:03:48 AM.  The initial version and the final version appear identical in this log based on the provided snippets.


`Skribe2.html` was modified at 11:01:39 AM and 11:03:04 AM.  Again,  the provided snippets for both timestamps are identical.  Both versions present a comparison of "Paid Distribution" and "Organic Articles" services, highlighting their respective benefits (turnaround time, credibility, SEO value, and cost).  The consistent use of tables for layout and similar styling across sections is a recurring pattern.  Both files employ a visually consistent design with a similar color scheme and font.  The content differences are subtle and may lie beyond the shown snippets.
