# Activity Summary for 8/9/2025

## 1:27:09 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of an HTML file (`NEWSocion1.html`)  between 5:49 PM and 6:21 PM on August 8th, 2025.  The file is an email template, likely for announcing the launch of a platform called "Socion."

The initial version (5:49 PM) was a complete email template with styling, images, and call-to-action.  Subsequent edits at 5:50 PM and 5:52 PM show minor, inconsequential changes; primarily the addition of a CSS class `.mobile-responsive-text` to improve responsiveness.

A separate file, `NEWSocion2.html`, was created at 5:59 PM.  This file appears to be a different version of the email, possibly a follow-up or a variant focusing on user onboarding, with altered headings ("Welcome to Socion," "Your Influencer Discovery Starts Now") and a restructured introduction and step-by-step guide.  This version showcases Socion's core functionalities for influencer marketing.

The most significant changes occur between 6:01 PM and 6:21 PM on `NEWSocion1.html`.  Sections of the email were commented out (`<!-- ... -->`), resulting in a more concise version. The initial hero image section was entirely removed in one edit (around 6:10 PM), only to be reintroduced in a later edit (6:21 PM).The  unsubscribe section was also commented out in multiple edits suggesting a decision to remove this functionality from the email.  There is a recurring pattern of using nested tables for layout, common in email design for better compatibility across email clients.  The images used are all hosted on `beta-app.goskribe.com`.  The consistent use of inline CSS styles suggests the email was likely designed for maximum compatibility across email clients.
