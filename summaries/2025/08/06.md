# Activity Summary for 8/6/2025

## 6:30:01 AM
The log shows a single code change on August 6th, 2025, at 2:36:55 AM, to the `Signup2.jsx` file within a React project.  This file contains a signup form component for a platform likely related to influencer marketing. The component uses functional components and hooks (`useState`) for managing form data.  The form collects information such as name, work email, designation, company, influencer marketing engagement level, monthly spending, current tools used, agency involvement, and biggest pain points.  The form uses Tailwind CSS for styling.  The submit functionality is present but currently empty (`handleSubmit` is a placeholder). The form includes a selection of pre-defined options for "biggest pain point".  The visual design incorporates images of a logo and background image.


## 10:45:01 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `Signup2.jsx` between 6:34 AM and 9:36 AM on August 6, 2025, primarily focusing on styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  The component is a signup form with fields for name, work email, designation, company, influencer engagement details, monthly spending, current marketing tools, agency involvement, and biggest pain points in influencer marketing.  A `select` element is used for the pain point field.

Early changes (6:34 AM - 6:38 AM) involved minor adjustments to the positioning and dimensions of the logo image within the component.  Later modifications (7:57 AM onwards) concentrated on refining the form's visual presentation.  This included adding `backdrop-blur`, `shadow`, and gradient background styles to the form container. The `bg-[#F8E9C7]` class is consistently used for background color.

Between 8:00 AM and 9:36 AM, further styling changes were made.  The `gap` property in the grid layout was adjusted. The border style of input fields was changed to `border-[#D1E9FF]`. The `px` value of the signup button was adjusted multiple times. The footer styling  was adjusted multiple times as well including its positioning and spacing. There was also a change from using `div` to `div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-4 justify-end w-full mr-[30px] mt-6"` for the footer to improve layout.


The `EmailPreview.jsx` file shows a largely commented-out React component, suggesting it might be under development or temporarily disabled. The file includes functionalities related to email previews, campaign data fetching and updating, attachment management, and user tracking.  The commented-out code suggests it was designed to interact with backend services (`userService`) and utilize various utilities for sanitizing content, converting HTML to plain text, and sending tracking data.  The lack of active code in the logged revision prevents a more detailed summary of its current functionality. A significant chunk of code was added at 10:39:01 AM,  uncommenting the component and suggesting a resumption of development.  Further minor changes followed, focused on component layout and error handling.


## 11:44:53 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `EmailPreview.jsx` on August 6th, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for displaying an email preview, likely for a social media campaign.  Changes are made throughout the morning, with significant updates around 10:45 AM, 11:28 AM, and 11:42 AM.  The code consistently uses a `userService` for API calls related to campaign data (`GET_DRAFT_DATA`, `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`, `DELETE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENT`).  The component fetches and sanitizes draft data, generates an email template based on campaign brief and user signature retrieved from local storage.  There's error handling and notification display implemented using `useNotification`.  The component also includes tracking functionality (`sendTrackingData`, `sendTrackingOnClose`) for abandonment events.  The code remains largely unchanged between edits, suggesting iterative refinement rather than substantial restructuring.


## 11:55:17 AM
The `SignUp.jsx` component, last updated on August 6th, 2025 at 10:57:27 AM, handles user signup for a service.  It uses React hooks for state management and makes API calls to `userService` for authentication.  Significant updates include robust input validation for organization name, user name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password (with a specified pattern).  The component handles various API response statuses, displaying appropriate messages to the user, including error handling for existing accounts, invalid emails, and OTP verification.  The use of a timer and OTP functionality are implemented.  Local storage is used to store user and user info data after successful signup.  Error messages are consistently managed using `setMessage` and `setVisible`, and a `messageTrigger` state resets error display timers. The code also includes schema markup for SEO purposes.  The `createFreeAccount` function is central to the signup process, orchestrating API calls and state updates based on the server response.


## 12:44:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `EmailPreview.jsx` on August 6th, 2025.  The code consistently focuses on rendering an email preview component, heavily relying on data fetched from a `userService`.  This service is used to retrieve draft data (`GET_DRAFT_DATA`), update campaign data (`INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`), and delete attachments (`DELETE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENT`).

The component fetches and sanitizes email content, including a `delivContent` array.  It generates an email template dynamically based on campaign brief and user signature, obtained from `localStorage`.  The component also includes functionality to edit the campaign brief, update the draft data, handle attachment deletion, and track user actions (abandonment using `sendTrackingOnClose`).

No substantive code changes are apparent between the various commits, suggesting minor edits or potential debugging rather than significant feature additions or refactoring.  The timestamps indicate a period of active development between approximately 11:44 AM and 12:08 PM, with multiple quick iterations.  The repeated nature of the code across all timestamps indicates no major structural changes during the logged period.


## 1:19:50 PM
The log shows development of a car detailing website.  Significant changes occurred between 12:20 PM and 1:08 PM on August 6th, 2025.

`Hero.tsx` (12:20 PM): This file contains the hero section of the website. It features a visually appealing design with a gradient background, text content highlighting detailing services, contact information (phone, location, hours), and a before/after image comparison of a car.  The before/after images are implemented using Next.js's `Image` component and the `lucide-react` icon library for phone, map pin, and clock icons.

`app\page.tsx` (12:22 PM & 12:26 PM): This file is the main page component.  It imports and renders various components, including the `Hero`, `Services`, `WhyChooseUs`, `Gallery`, `BeforeAfter`, `Process`, `Testimonials`, and `Footer` components. Between the two timestamps, the `Gallery` and `BeforeAfter` components were removed.

`Services.tsx` (12:25 PM & 12:25 PM): This file displays the detailing services offered. The component initially used an Unsplash image for "Auto Window Tinting", but this was later replaced with a local image (`service3.png`) in a subsequent update within a minute. The component is styled using Tailwind CSS and shows service cards with images, titles, and links to detail pages.

`app\about\page.tsx` (12:28 PM): This file creates the "About Us" page.  It includes a hero section similar in style to the main page's hero, a section with an image and text about the company's background and mission, and a section with statistics on cars detailed, professionals employed, and customer satisfaction.

`Navbar.tsx` (1:08 PM): This file renders the website's navigation bar. It uses client-side rendering ("use client"), features a responsive design adapting to different screen sizes, and includes links to home, about, services (with a dropdown menu initially present, but later commented out), contact, and a "Get A Quote" button.  The navigation utilizes `lucide-react` icons and `next/link` for internal navigation.  A mobile menu is implemented for smaller screens.

A recurring pattern is the consistent use of Tailwind CSS for styling and `lucide-react` for icons across all components. The color scheme predominantly features shades of blue and orange.  The code also leverages Next.js features like `Image` component and client-side rendering.
