# Activity Summary for 8/6/2025

## 6:30:01 AM
The log shows a single code change on August 6th, 2025, at 2:36:55 AM, to the `Signup2.jsx` file within a React project.  This file contains a signup form component for a platform likely related to influencer marketing. The component uses functional components and hooks (`useState`) for managing form data.  The form collects information such as name, work email, designation, company, influencer marketing engagement level, monthly spending, current tools used, agency involvement, and biggest pain points.  The form uses Tailwind CSS for styling.  The submit functionality is present but currently empty (`handleSubmit` is a placeholder). The form includes a selection of pre-defined options for "biggest pain point".  The visual design incorporates images of a logo and background image.


## 10:45:01 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `Signup2.jsx` between 6:34 AM and 9:36 AM on August 6, 2025, primarily focusing on styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  The component is a signup form with fields for name, work email, designation, company, influencer engagement details, monthly spending, current marketing tools, agency involvement, and biggest pain points in influencer marketing.  A `select` element is used for the pain point field.

Early changes (6:34 AM - 6:38 AM) involved minor adjustments to the positioning and dimensions of the logo image within the component.  Later modifications (7:57 AM onwards) concentrated on refining the form's visual presentation.  This included adding `backdrop-blur`, `shadow`, and gradient background styles to the form container. The `bg-[#F8E9C7]` class is consistently used for background color.

Between 8:00 AM and 9:36 AM, further styling changes were made.  The `gap` property in the grid layout was adjusted. The border style of input fields was changed to `border-[#D1E9FF]`. The `px` value of the signup button was adjusted multiple times. The footer styling  was adjusted multiple times as well including its positioning and spacing. There was also a change from using `div` to `div className="flex flex-row items-center gap-4 justify-end w-full mr-[30px] mt-6"` for the footer to improve layout.


The `EmailPreview.jsx` file shows a largely commented-out React component, suggesting it might be under development or temporarily disabled. The file includes functionalities related to email previews, campaign data fetching and updating, attachment management, and user tracking.  The commented-out code suggests it was designed to interact with backend services (`userService`) and utilize various utilities for sanitizing content, converting HTML to plain text, and sending tracking data.  The lack of active code in the logged revision prevents a more detailed summary of its current functionality. A significant chunk of code was added at 10:39:01 AM,  uncommenting the component and suggesting a resumption of development.  Further minor changes followed, focused on component layout and error handling.
