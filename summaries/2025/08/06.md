# Activity Summary for 8/6/2025

## 6:30:01 AM
The log shows a single code change on August 6th, 2025, at 2:36:55 AM, to the `Signup2.jsx` file within a React project.  This file contains a signup form component for a platform likely related to influencer marketing. The component uses functional components and hooks (`useState`) for managing form data.  The form collects information such as name, work email, designation, company, influencer marketing engagement level, monthly spending, current tools used, agency involvement, and biggest pain points.  The form uses Tailwind CSS for styling.  The submit functionality is present but currently empty (`handleSubmit` is a placeholder). The form includes a selection of pre-defined options for "biggest pain point".  The visual design incorporates images of a logo and background image.
