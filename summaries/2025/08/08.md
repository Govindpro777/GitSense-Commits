# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 12:38:40 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `Hero.tsx` component between 11:43 PM and 11:51 PM on August 7th, 2025, and further modifications on August 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the image displayed in the "Before/After" section. Initially, there were commented-out sections suggesting different image sources and implementations.  The final version of August 7th uses images imported from  `@/public/before1.jpg` and `@/public/after1.jpg`. On August 8th, there were no functional changes to the `Hero.tsx` component; only commented-out code remains.

The `Navbar.tsx` component was updated at 12:13:58 AM on August 8th, 2025.  This revision introduces a responsive navigation bar with a dropdown for services, using `lucide-react` icons and Next.js's `Link` component for navigation. The name of the business has changed from "A&B Detailing" to "Haitch Barber shop".

The `window-tinting.tsx`, `exterior.tsx`, and `complete-package.tsx` files were updated at 12:14 AM on August 8th, 2025. These files represent different service pages, each structured similarly.  They showcase service details, packages, and before/after images.  They all use similar styling and components, suggesting a consistent design language across the site.  The code in each service file was later replaced with form-related code, likely for service bookings.


The `Footer.tsx` component was updated at 12:18:20 AM on August 8th, 2025. The changes involved restructuring the layout from a grid-based design to three columns, adding social media links, contact information, and opening hours. The name of the business has also been changed to "Haitch Barber shop". The attribution for the site's creation changed from "WebCraft Studios" to "Hachi agency".

The `Testimonials.tsx` component underwent several changes between 12:36 AM and 12:37 AM on August 8th, 2025. The component was initially implemented as a static grid of testimonials.  It was then refactored to utilize the Swiper library for a more interactive carousel of testimonials, incorporating image display and star ratings. A significant change is that the testimonial text is truncated if it exceeds 150 characters.


## 1:39:00 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React components between 12:38 AM and 1:33 AM on August 8th, 2025.  The `Testimonials.tsx` component underwent one major revision. Initially, it was a simple component displaying testimonials with names, ratings, and text. The updated version, at 12:38 AM, incorporates a carousel using the Swiper library, fetched from a CDN, and enhanced the presentation with images and roles for each testimonial.  A custom `StarRating` component was also added.

The `Process.tsx` component was revised multiple times between 12:41 AM and 12:55 AM. The initial version displayed four process steps with numbers, titles, and descriptions. Subsequent edits focused on improving the visual appeal and layout. Changes included adding a background gradient, a dotted connection line between steps, green numbered boxes for each step, and additional background elements for depth.  The styling of the header and step descriptions was also refined throughout these iterations, with a shift towards a darker blue/cyan gradient theme.


The `Gallery.tsx` component saw substantial changes from 12:46 AM to 1:17 AM. The component's core functionality remained the same—displaying a filterable image gallery—but its design was significantly enhanced.  Early versions had a simple layout.  Later versions introduced animated background elements, improved filter buttons with icons, and more sophisticated image styling with hover effects, animations, and category badges.  The background color also changed from white to a dark blue gradient and the `max-width` of the container was adjusted in multiple commits.  The gallery component also added descriptions for each gallery item.

The `WhyChooseUs.tsx` component was updated once at 12:56 AM. This version added a more visually appealing layout, using images, titles, and a stats section, all with updated styling. The overall theme uses a darker blue background.

The `Services.tsx` component was updated twice between 1:21 AM and 1:22 AM.  It was initially a simple component displaying services with images and links. The final version at 1:22 AM enhanced its visual style significantly. It now features animated background elements, a grid pattern overlay, glowing border effects, floating particles, and a more refined CTA section.  The service descriptions were also shortened and a feature list was added.

The `CompletePackage.tsx`, `WindowTinting.tsx`, and `InteriorDetailing.tsx` pages were updated once each between 1:23 AM and 1:26 AM. These updates converted the static content pages into interactive forms for user input and data capture. A significant addition was the integration of a form for collecting user information and preferences related to the services offered on each page.

Finally, the `BeforeAfter.tsx` component underwent multiple refinements from 1:07 AM to 1:18 AM. The component started as a simple before-and-after image comparison.  It was significantly redesigned to present the comparisons in a more visually engaging way using a grid layout, and including hover effects, a plus icon to highlight the difference,  labels, and background radial gradients.  The number of columns in the grid was also adjusted in multiple revisions, starting with 3 and ending with 4.  The final version improved image presentation by using `rounded-l-lg` and `rounded-r-lg` classes for rounded corners and added a larger number of before and after images.


A common pattern across all components is a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling, along with an emphasis on visual appeal and interactive elements.  There's a strong preference for gradients and hover effects. The color scheme centers around shades of blue, cyan, orange and pink.  Most components include a "BOOK NOW" button.  The updates follow a clear progression towards a more polished and dynamic user interface.


## 10:19:01 AM
The file `EmailPreview.jsx` contains a React component for previewing and editing email content within a social media campaign context.  The component fetches draft data (including deliverables and campaign brief) using a `userService`, sanitizes HTML content, and allows editing of email sections before and after deliverables.  Significant updates on August 8th, 2025, at 9:42:33 AM, included the implementation of functions for:

* **Fetching and sanitizing draft data:**  The component retrieves draft data, sanitizing the `delivContent` array to handle potential issues with newlines and tabs.  Error handling is included for fetching draft data.
* **Generating email body:**  `generateInitialEmailBody` dynamically creates an email body based on draft data, including a table of deliverables.
* **Editing email content:** The component splits the email body into sections ("preContent" and "postContent") for easier editing and allows updating them via `handlePreContentChange` and `handlePostContentChange` (with a 4000 character limit).
* **Saving email updates:** `addSubjectAndBody` is used to save subject line and updated email content via `userService.put`.
* **Attachment management:**  `handleRemoveAttachment` provides functionality to delete attachments from the campaign.  Successful or unsuccessful deletion is reflected by displaying notifications.

The code extensively uses helper functions for content manipulation, sanitization, and data formatting.  The component utilizes several external services (`userService`, `useNotification`) and constants (`GET_DRAFT_DATA`, `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`, `DELETE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENT`).  Regular expressions are used to extract the campaign brief from the edited email content.  There's a clear separation of concerns with many well-defined functions.  Error handling is present throughout the code, managing HTTP error responses and displaying informative notifications to the user.


## 11:06:42 AM
The provided log only contains information about a `.env` file, which is omitted from the summary due to its potential to contain sensitive information like API keys or passwords.  Therefore, no summary of code changes can be provided based on the given input.


## 12:19:02 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `SignupStep.jsx`, a React component for a signup form.  The file underwent several iterations between 12:10 PM and 12:18 PM on August 8th, 2025.

Initially (12:10 PM), the component was a functional signup form with fields for name, work email, designation, company, influencer marketing engagement, monthly spending, tools used, agency involvement, and biggest pain point.  It used Next.js's `useRouter` for navigation and a custom `useNotification` hook for feedback.  Validation was implemented to check for empty or short names, and to ensure the email provided was a company email (not from public domains like Gmail or Yahoo). The `MultiSelectDropdown` component was imported but not used.


Between 12:10 PM and 12:14 PM, the code was repeatedly commented out entirely, suggesting a potential temporary removal or debugging step.

Finally, the code was restored to a version similar to the initial one (12:17 PM and 12:18 PM), with the `MultiSelectDropdown` component no longer imported.  There were no substantive changes to the core functionality of the component during these final commits; it simply remained the same as the initial commit, indicating that the commenting-out process was likely a temporary measure.  The overall pattern suggests an iterative development process involving temporary code removal, likely for troubleshooting or experimentation.


## 1:21:16 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two React components: `MultiDroopdown.jsx` and `SignupStep.jsx`.  `SignupStep.jsx` underwent significant changes between its initial commented-out state and its final functional form.  The final version of `SignupStep.jsx` is a fully functional React component for a sign-up form.  It includes form fields for name, work email, designation, company, influencer marketing engagement, monthly spending, tools used, agency collaboration, and biggest pain points in influencer marketing.  The component uses a custom hook (`useNotification`) for displaying notifications, performs client-side email validation, and utilizes a `userService` to submit the form data.  A crucial change was the implementation of a `MultiSelectDropdown` component for selecting multiple pain points.

The `MultiDroopdown.jsx` component, a reusable multi-select dropdown, underwent numerous styling and minor functional updates throughout the log.  Early versions featured a more standard appearance and a search bar.  Later versions removed the search functionality and focused primarily on styling changes, refining the look of the dropdown menu, using different background colors, padding, border styles, text sizes, and alignment within the component.  The final version maintains the multi-select functionality but lacks the search bar present in earlier iterations, suggesting that it might be rendered separately.  The changes in `MultiDroopdown.jsx` generally involved adjusting the styling properties in the component's CSS classes.  Significant changes occurred between 12:23:00 PM and 12:26:49 PM, where the visual style was overhauled.  Further adjustments to padding and text size were made between 12:34:27 PM and 12:35:26 PM.  Finally, the search input was removed completely around 12:35:26 PM. The text size of the options in the dropdown changed from `text-xs` to `text-sm` around 12:26:49 PM.

The `SignupStep.jsx` file was initially entirely commented out. It was uncommented and completed around 12:37:47 PM, and then further revised until 12:49:13 PM to incorporate the `MultiSelectDropdown` and a mechanism for removing selected pain points.  There is a pattern of incremental changes to both components, with frequent updates focusing on improving the user interface and user experience through style adjustments.


## 2:21:10 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `SignupStep.jsx` and `Signup.jsx` components between 1:21 PM and 2:16 PM on August 8, 2025.

`SignupStep.jsx` underwent several iterations, primarily focusing on refining the user signup form. Initially, the code was commented out.  The most significant change occurred at 1:27:12 PM, where the comments were removed, and the code became functional.  This version introduced a fully functional signup form with input fields for name, work email, designation, company, influencer marketing activities, monthly spend, tools used, and whether the user works with a marketing agency.  Validation checks were implemented for each field, and error notifications were added.  A crucial update at 1:35:41 PM transformed the "biggestPainPoint" field from a text input to a multi-select dropdown using a custom `MultiSelectDropdown` component and `react-icons/rx`. This allows users to select multiple pain points.  The final version included added functionality to display and remove selected options from the dropdown.

`Signup.jsx` shows a signup form with OTP functionality. The code remained consistently commented out throughout the revisions, indicating that the component was not yet functional during the logged period.  The commented-out code suggests a more complex signup process involving early access tokens, OTP verification, and detailed user information input.  The code includes validation rules for organization name, name, email, phone number, and password, similar to the validation in `SignupStep.jsx`, further indicating that a comprehensive signup flow is being developed.  No actual code execution or changes occurred in this file during the logged period.

A common element across both files is the use of `userService` for API calls and `useNotification` for displaying notifications to the user.  The consistent use of commented-out code blocks suggests a deliberate and incremental development approach, possibly reflecting a work in progress.


## 4:32:35 PM
The log shows multiple updates to authentication components (`OTP.jsx` and `SignUp.jsx`) and a login component (`Login.jsx`) within a React application.  `SignUp.jsx` consistently appears as commented-out code throughout the log, suggesting a work-in-progress or a temporary disabling of this component's functionality.

**OTP.jsx:**

* **8/8/2025, 3:32:44 PM:** Initial commit of the OTP component.  This version includes basic OTP input handling, focusing on the next input field after each digit is entered, and submission of the complete OTP to a parent component.  It also includes functionality to handle pasted OTPs. The UI is implemented using React's `createPortal` for modal display and Tailwind CSS for styling.

* **8/8/2025, 3:50:58 PM & 8/8/2025, 3:51:17 PM:**  These updates add arrow key and backspace handling to the OTP input fields, improving user experience and allowing for more intuitive navigation within the OTP input.  The second update adds `onKeyDown` event handler to the input field.

**Login.jsx:**

* **8/8/2025, 3:50:19 PM:** This component handles user login, including OTP generation and verification.  It uses `next/navigation` for routing and  `AuthService` and `userService` for backend communication.  A unique browser ID is generated and stored as a cookie for security purposes. The component handles various login scenarios including successful login, OTP requirement, expired free trials, invalid OTPs, and expired OTPs, redirecting to appropriate pages based on the response.  The UI uses a Navbar and Footer.

**SignUp.jsx:**

* **8/8/2025, 3:43:05 PM, 3:43:41 PM, 3:49:28 PM, 3:52:08 PM, 3:54:22 PM, 3:54:50 PM, 3:55:05 PM, 3:55:51 PM, 3:56:18 PM, 3:57:04 PM, 3:57:56 PM, 3:58:05 PM, 3:58:31 PM, 3:58:39 PM, 3:58:50 PM, 3:59:24 PM, 3:59:30 PM, 4:00:02 PM, 4:01:33 PM:**  Throughout the log, this component remains commented out. The commented code suggests a comprehensive signup flow involving user information input, OTP verification, and backend API calls (`userService`) to create a free account.  Input validation is implemented, checking for minimum lengths, email formats (rejecting public email domains), and password complexity.  Error handling and feedback messages to users are also present.


Significant changes are clustered around 3:50 PM and later, indicating a period of focused development and refinement, primarily on the login and OTP components.  The numerous, rapid updates to `SignUp.jsx` without uncommenting show  ongoing development and potential debugging, but the final state remains commented out. A recurring pattern is the use of  `userService` and `AuthService` for API interactions and the consistent handling of OTP flows in both login and (commented) signup processes.


## 4:36:24 PM
The `Signup.jsx` component underwent significant changes on August 8th, 2025, at 3:37:13 PM.  The code implements a user signup form with features for both early access users (via a token) and standard users.  The form handles user input for organization name, email, phone number, name, password, and a 4-digit OTP.

Key updates include:

* **Extensive form validation:**  The code rigorously validates user inputs, checking for minimum lengths (organization name, name, phone number), password complexity, email format (disallowing public email domains unless early access is used), and password confirmation.  Error messages are displayed using a `showNotification` function.
* **OTP implementation:**  A 4-digit OTP is implemented using controlled inputs, auto-focus to the next input field, and paste handling to ensure only 4 characters are used. A countdown timer is also implemented for the OTP.
* **Early access handling:**  The component checks for an `id` token in the URL parameters to initiate an early access flow. It fetches user details using a `userService` and populates the form accordingly.
* **Local storage cleanup:**  Upon component mount, any existing user information in local storage is cleared.
* **Conditional routing:** After successful signup or error, the code routes to a `/summary` page.
* **Asynchronous operations:**  The component uses `async/await` for making API calls to fetch early access information and handle signup.

The code uses several React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useRouter`, `useSearchParams`), and it relies on external services (`userService`) and constants (`SOCIAL_SIGNUP`, `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO`, `USERINFO`).  The overall structure suggests a well-organized component despite its length.  The extensive use of `useState` to manage component state is notable.


## 5:32:25 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `blogData.js` and `Bloggg.jsx`, both containing data for a blog.  The files appear to contain similar data structures representing blog posts.

The first significant change occurred around 4:37 PM on August 8th, 2025, with the initial commit to `blogData.js`. This commit included data for two blog posts:  "7 Newsletters Every PR & Comms Pro Should Subscribe To" and "7 Press Release Types Every Brand Should Master (with Examples)".  Both posts included detailed content, author information ("Team Skribe"), and related posts.

At approximately 4:39 PM on the same day, a very similar dataset was added to `Bloggg.jsx`, seemingly a duplicate of the information already present in `blogData.js`, but lacking `authorAvatar` and `featuredImage` fields.  This suggests a possible redundancy or inconsistency in the data management.

A subsequent update to `blogData.js` at 4:49 PM added a second blog post to the data array, with information consistent with the existing structure.

Finally, at 5:25 PM, `Bloggg.jsx` was updated.  The most significant change was the addition of  `tip`, `example`, and `link` fields within the `listItems` array of the first blog post.  A `bookLine` field was also added to the `content` object of the same blog post, although its value is currently empty.  This suggests the addition of new fields to the blog post data structure in this file.  The overall structure remained similar to the `blogData.js` file, but the additional fields are different.
