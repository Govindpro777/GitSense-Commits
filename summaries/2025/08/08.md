# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 12:38:40 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `Hero.tsx` component between 11:43 PM and 11:51 PM on August 7th, 2025, and further modifications on August 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the image displayed in the "Before/After" section. Initially, there were commented-out sections suggesting different image sources and implementations.  The final version of August 7th uses images imported from  `@/public/before1.jpg` and `@/public/after1.jpg`. On August 8th, there were no functional changes to the `Hero.tsx` component; only commented-out code remains.

The `Navbar.tsx` component was updated at 12:13:58 AM on August 8th, 2025.  This revision introduces a responsive navigation bar with a dropdown for services, using `lucide-react` icons and Next.js's `Link` component for navigation. The name of the business has changed from "A&B Detailing" to "Haitch Barber shop".

The `window-tinting.tsx`, `exterior.tsx`, and `complete-package.tsx` files were updated at 12:14 AM on August 8th, 2025. These files represent different service pages, each structured similarly.  They showcase service details, packages, and before/after images.  They all use similar styling and components, suggesting a consistent design language across the site.  The code in each service file was later replaced with form-related code, likely for service bookings.


The `Footer.tsx` component was updated at 12:18:20 AM on August 8th, 2025. The changes involved restructuring the layout from a grid-based design to three columns, adding social media links, contact information, and opening hours. The name of the business has also been changed to "Haitch Barber shop". The attribution for the site's creation changed from "WebCraft Studios" to "Hachi agency".

The `Testimonials.tsx` component underwent several changes between 12:36 AM and 12:37 AM on August 8th, 2025. The component was initially implemented as a static grid of testimonials.  It was then refactored to utilize the Swiper library for a more interactive carousel of testimonials, incorporating image display and star ratings. A significant change is that the testimonial text is truncated if it exceeds 150 characters.


## 1:39:00 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React components between 12:38 AM and 1:33 AM on August 8th, 2025.  The `Testimonials.tsx` component underwent one major revision. Initially, it was a simple component displaying testimonials with names, ratings, and text. The updated version, at 12:38 AM, incorporates a carousel using the Swiper library, fetched from a CDN, and enhanced the presentation with images and roles for each testimonial.  A custom `StarRating` component was also added.

The `Process.tsx` component was revised multiple times between 12:41 AM and 12:55 AM. The initial version displayed four process steps with numbers, titles, and descriptions. Subsequent edits focused on improving the visual appeal and layout. Changes included adding a background gradient, a dotted connection line between steps, green numbered boxes for each step, and additional background elements for depth.  The styling of the header and step descriptions was also refined throughout these iterations, with a shift towards a darker blue/cyan gradient theme.


The `Gallery.tsx` component saw substantial changes from 12:46 AM to 1:17 AM. The component's core functionality remained the same—displaying a filterable image gallery—but its design was significantly enhanced.  Early versions had a simple layout.  Later versions introduced animated background elements, improved filter buttons with icons, and more sophisticated image styling with hover effects, animations, and category badges.  The background color also changed from white to a dark blue gradient and the `max-width` of the container was adjusted in multiple commits.  The gallery component also added descriptions for each gallery item.

The `WhyChooseUs.tsx` component was updated once at 12:56 AM. This version added a more visually appealing layout, using images, titles, and a stats section, all with updated styling. The overall theme uses a darker blue background.

The `Services.tsx` component was updated twice between 1:21 AM and 1:22 AM.  It was initially a simple component displaying services with images and links. The final version at 1:22 AM enhanced its visual style significantly. It now features animated background elements, a grid pattern overlay, glowing border effects, floating particles, and a more refined CTA section.  The service descriptions were also shortened and a feature list was added.

The `CompletePackage.tsx`, `WindowTinting.tsx`, and `InteriorDetailing.tsx` pages were updated once each between 1:23 AM and 1:26 AM. These updates converted the static content pages into interactive forms for user input and data capture. A significant addition was the integration of a form for collecting user information and preferences related to the services offered on each page.

Finally, the `BeforeAfter.tsx` component underwent multiple refinements from 1:07 AM to 1:18 AM. The component started as a simple before-and-after image comparison.  It was significantly redesigned to present the comparisons in a more visually engaging way using a grid layout, and including hover effects, a plus icon to highlight the difference,  labels, and background radial gradients.  The number of columns in the grid was also adjusted in multiple revisions, starting with 3 and ending with 4.  The final version improved image presentation by using `rounded-l-lg` and `rounded-r-lg` classes for rounded corners and added a larger number of before and after images.


A common pattern across all components is a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling, along with an emphasis on visual appeal and interactive elements.  There's a strong preference for gradients and hover effects. The color scheme centers around shades of blue, cyan, orange and pink.  Most components include a "BOOK NOW" button.  The updates follow a clear progression towards a more polished and dynamic user interface.


## 10:19:01 AM
The file `EmailPreview.jsx` contains a React component for previewing and editing email content within a social media campaign context.  The component fetches draft data (including deliverables and campaign brief) using a `userService`, sanitizes HTML content, and allows editing of email sections before and after deliverables.  Significant updates on August 8th, 2025, at 9:42:33 AM, included the implementation of functions for:

* **Fetching and sanitizing draft data:**  The component retrieves draft data, sanitizing the `delivContent` array to handle potential issues with newlines and tabs.  Error handling is included for fetching draft data.
* **Generating email body:**  `generateInitialEmailBody` dynamically creates an email body based on draft data, including a table of deliverables.
* **Editing email content:** The component splits the email body into sections ("preContent" and "postContent") for easier editing and allows updating them via `handlePreContentChange` and `handlePostContentChange` (with a 4000 character limit).
* **Saving email updates:** `addSubjectAndBody` is used to save subject line and updated email content via `userService.put`.
* **Attachment management:**  `handleRemoveAttachment` provides functionality to delete attachments from the campaign.  Successful or unsuccessful deletion is reflected by displaying notifications.

The code extensively uses helper functions for content manipulation, sanitization, and data formatting.  The component utilizes several external services (`userService`, `useNotification`) and constants (`GET_DRAFT_DATA`, `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`, `DELETE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENT`).  Regular expressions are used to extract the campaign brief from the edited email content.  There's a clear separation of concerns with many well-defined functions.  Error handling is present throughout the code, managing HTTP error responses and displaying informative notifications to the user.
