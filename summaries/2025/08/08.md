The log shows multiple revisions to the `Hero.tsx` component between 11:43 PM and 11:51 PM on August 7th, 2025, and further modifications on August 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the image displayed in the "Before/After" section. Initially, there were commented-out sections suggesting different image sources and implementations.  The final version of August 7th uses images imported from  `@/public/before1.jpg` and `@/public/after1.jpg`. On August 8th, there were no functional changes to the `Hero.tsx` component; only commented-out code remains.

The `Navbar.tsx` component was updated at 12:13:58 AM on August 8th, 2025.  This revision introduces a responsive navigation bar with a dropdown for services, using `lucide-react` icons and Next.js's `Link` component for navigation. The name of the business has changed from "A&B Detailing" to "Haitch Barber shop".

The `window-tinting.tsx`, `exterior.tsx`, and `complete-package.tsx` files were updated at 12:14 AM on August 8th, 2025. These files represent different service pages, each structured similarly.  They showcase service details, packages, and before/after images.  They all use similar styling and components, suggesting a consistent design language across the site.  The code in each service file was later replaced with form-related code, likely for service bookings.


The `Footer.tsx` component was updated at 12:18:20 AM on August 8th, 2025. The changes involved restructuring the layout from a grid-based design to three columns, adding social media links, contact information, and opening hours. The name of the business has also been changed to "Haitch Barber shop". The attribution for the site's creation changed from "WebCraft Studios" to "Hachi agency".

The `Testimonials.tsx` component underwent several changes between 12:36 AM and 12:37 AM on August 8th, 2025. The component was initially implemented as a static grid of testimonials.  It was then refactored to utilize the Swiper library for a more interactive carousel of testimonials, incorporating image display and star ratings. A significant change is that the testimonial text is truncated if it exceeds 150 characters.
