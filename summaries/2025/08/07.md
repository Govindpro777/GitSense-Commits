# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 10:13:03 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `EmailPreview.jsx` on August 7th, 2025.  All revisions contain the same commented-out React component code, suggesting iterative development and debugging.  No functional changes are apparent between the revisions; the code remains largely unchanged. The timestamps indicate frequent edits within a short time frame (9:28 AM, 9:36 AM, 9:39 AM, and 9:45 AM), possibly reflecting a period of testing or minor adjustments to the component.  The code itself focuses on fetching and displaying email preview data, sanitizing content, generating an email template based on fetched data, handling user interactions (like editing and deleting attachments), and sending tracking data.  The `userService` is heavily used for interacting with backend services related to campaign data.


## 11:13:06 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`, both related to an email preview component.  The majority of changes are in `EmailPreview.jsx`.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent several revisions between 10:21 AM and 11:09 AM.  These modifications seem focused on fetching and displaying email preview data (`GET_DRAFT_DATA` endpoint), handling user interaction (editing campaign brief and signature), and implementing error handling and user feedback mechanisms.  The code heavily relies on a `userService` for API calls and uses local storage to retrieve user information.  A notable pattern involves repeated sanitization of content to remove extra whitespace and newlines.  The  `sendTrackingOnClose` function is used for tracking email preview abandonment. There are no substantial structural changes; the updates appear to be iterative refinements and bug fixes.


`EmailContent.jsx` was modified at 10:22 AM and again at 10:28 AM and 10:46 AM. These changes are minor and focus on the formatting of email content, specifically the rendering of tables and styled text elements (bold, italics, bullet points) within the email body using React components.  The `generateEmailHtmlString` function converts the React components to static HTML markup.  The updates here are primarily focused on improving the visual presentation of the email content within the preview.  The final changes at 10:46 AM do not appear to alter functionality.
