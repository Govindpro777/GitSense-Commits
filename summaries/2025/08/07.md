The log shows multiple revisions of `EmailPreview.jsx` on August 7th, 2025.  All revisions contain the same commented-out React component code, suggesting iterative development and debugging.  No functional changes are apparent between the revisions; the code remains largely unchanged. The timestamps indicate frequent edits within a short time frame (9:28 AM, 9:36 AM, 9:39 AM, and 9:45 AM), possibly reflecting a period of testing or minor adjustments to the component.  The code itself focuses on fetching and displaying email preview data, sanitizing content, generating an email template based on fetched data, handling user interactions (like editing and deleting attachments), and sending tracking data.  The `userService` is heavily used for interacting with backend services related to campaign data.
