# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 10:13:03 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `EmailPreview.jsx` on August 7th, 2025.  All revisions contain the same commented-out React component code, suggesting iterative development and debugging.  No functional changes are apparent between the revisions; the code remains largely unchanged. The timestamps indicate frequent edits within a short time frame (9:28 AM, 9:36 AM, 9:39 AM, and 9:45 AM), possibly reflecting a period of testing or minor adjustments to the component.  The code itself focuses on fetching and displaying email preview data, sanitizing content, generating an email template based on fetched data, handling user interactions (like editing and deleting attachments), and sending tracking data.  The `userService` is heavily used for interacting with backend services related to campaign data.


## 11:13:06 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `EmailPreview.jsx` and `EmailContent.jsx`, both related to an email preview component.  The majority of changes are in `EmailPreview.jsx`.

`EmailPreview.jsx` underwent several revisions between 10:21 AM and 11:09 AM.  These modifications seem focused on fetching and displaying email preview data (`GET_DRAFT_DATA` endpoint), handling user interaction (editing campaign brief and signature), and implementing error handling and user feedback mechanisms.  The code heavily relies on a `userService` for API calls and uses local storage to retrieve user information.  A notable pattern involves repeated sanitization of content to remove extra whitespace and newlines.  The  `sendTrackingOnClose` function is used for tracking email preview abandonment. There are no substantial structural changes; the updates appear to be iterative refinements and bug fixes.


`EmailContent.jsx` was modified at 10:22 AM and again at 10:28 AM and 10:46 AM. These changes are minor and focus on the formatting of email content, specifically the rendering of tables and styled text elements (bold, italics, bullet points) within the email body using React components.  The `generateEmailHtmlString` function converts the React components to static HTML markup.  The updates here are primarily focused on improving the visual presentation of the email content within the preview.  The final changes at 10:46 AM do not appear to alter functionality.


## 1:13:03 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `EmailPreview.jsx` on August 7th, 2025.  The code is a React component responsible for displaying and editing an email preview related to a campaign.  No substantive changes were made to the code across the multiple revisions; all commits show identical code. The timestamps indicate frequent edits within a short period (between 11:16 AM and 12:42 PM), suggesting iterative development or debugging. The component interacts with a `userService` for fetching and updating campaign data (`GET_DRAFT_DATA`, `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`), and uses a `useNotification` hook for displaying messages to the user.  The code includes functions for sanitizing content, generating an email template (including a table of deliverables), and handling attachment removal.  The component manages the edit state of the campaign brief and tracks user actions, such as abandoning the email preview (`sendTrackingOnClose`).  The core functionality and structure of the component remain consistent across all commits.


## 1:57:11 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `Hero.tsx` component between 1:00 PM and 1:34 PM on August 7, 2025.  The `page.tsx` file was updated at 1:00:26 PM,  importing various components to render the main page layout.  The significant changes occur within `Hero.tsx`.

Initially, the `Hero.tsx` component was heavily commented out, suggesting an iterative development process.  The initial uncommented version  featured a before/after image comparison using a state variable (`isAfter`) and a Next.js `Image` component.  However, this image component and the `car` import were subsequently commented out.  Over the next few commits, the commented out code remained, while a functional before/after image comparison was implemented using `img` tags and Unsplash image URLs.  Later,  the Unsplash images were replaced with local images (`before1.jpg` and `after1.jpg`), requiring imports for `before1` and `after1`. Finally the `img` tags were replaced with the `next/image` component.


The final version, at 1:34:28 PM, uses two `next/image` components to display the before and after images simultaneously, toggling their opacity based on the `isAfter` state. This approach is a more efficient and optimized method for showing before and after images compared to previous versions.  Throughout the changes, the overall structure and styling of the `Hero` component remained consistent, primarily focusing on the before/after image display implementation.


## 2:48:06 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `user_signed_up.html` between 1:53 PM and 2:22 PM on August 7th, 2025.  The main focus of the changes was refining the email's content and design.

Initially, the email was a welcome message for new Skribe users, highlighting the platform's features (discovering stories, tracking brand mentions, automated analytics, press release distribution, and access to a journalist database).

A significant change occurred around 1:53 PM, with the addition of information about logging in using Socion credentials and clarifying that the platform is for journalist discovery and outreach.

Between 2:04 PM and 2:09 PM, several revisions modified the footer's social media links.  Specifically, the source of the social media icons was updated to use a `beta-app.goskribe.com` URL instead of `www.goskribe.com`, and the order of the icons was slightly changed in multiple edits during this period.

Finally, between 2:08 PM and 2:22 PM, the email's overall styling was adjusted, adding a light grey (`#ccc`) background color to the body and outer table, while the inner table containing the email content received a white background.  The addition of `cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"` attributes to the outer table suggests improved table rendering. The final edit seems to have truncated some closing tags in the unsubscribe module.  Throughout the edits, the core content of the welcome email remained largely consistent, suggesting a focus on visual improvements and minor textual adjustments rather than substantial alterations to the message itself.


## 2:57:11 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `Hero.tsx` and `Gallery.tsx`.

**Hero.tsx:**

Two significant changes occurred in `Hero.tsx`.  The first, at 2:39:49 PM, introduced the component's initial structure, featuring a hero section with a background gradient, text content ("Revive, Restore, Renew"), buttons ("Learn More," "Get Gift Card"), contact information, and a before/after image comparison.  Importantly, the initial version used placeholder image paths (`car2.png`). The second revision at 2:45:35 PM replaced the placeholder images with `before1.jpg` and `after1.jpg` from the project's `public` directory.  This revision also significantly improved the before/after image display, adding a toggle button and captions and improved the styling of the before/after image section by adding a key prop for react to rerender and improve the transitions and making the section more visually appealing.  The  `Import` icon was also removed from the import statements.

**Gallery.tsx:**

The `Gallery.tsx` component underwent several revisions between 2:47:16 PM and 2:55:58 PM.  These changes primarily involved replacing placeholder image URLs from Unsplash with local image paths  (`/exterior1.webp`, `/interior1.jpg`, `/window.jpg`). The initial version at 2:47:16 PM  used a mix of local and unsplash images. Subsequent commits, between 2:47:31 PM and 2:55:58 PM,  systematically replaced the Unsplash image URLs with local image file paths, making the gallery more maintainable and likely improving loading speeds.  The image file extensions also changed a few times between `.webp` and `.jpg` and `.png`.  The component's functionality (category filtering, image display) remained consistent throughout these revisions.


## 3:13:04 PM
The `EmailPreview.jsx` component, last updated on August 7, 2025, at 2:57:23 PM,  manages an email preview for social media campaigns.  It fetches draft data using `userService.get` (path including `${GET_DRAFT_DATA}/${campId}`) and updates it via `userService.put` (path including `${INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE}/${campId}`).  The component features functionalities for:

* **Data fetching and sanitization:** It retrieves draft data, including deliverables and campaign briefs, sanitizing content to remove extra whitespace and newlines.  Error handling is implemented for failed API calls.  `sanitizeContent` and `sanitizeDelivContent` functions are used for this purpose.

* **Email template generation:**  It dynamically generates an email template based on fetched data, including a table of deliverables and campaign brief.  `generateDeliverableTable` and `generateEmailTemplate` functions are responsible for this generation.  Placeholder values are used initially ("CAMPAIGN_BRIEF_PLACEHOLDER", "SIGNATURE_PLACEHOLDER").

* **Edit and update functionality:** Users can edit the campaign brief and email signature.  Changes are saved using `updateDraftData`, which makes a PUT request to update the draft data.  Input validation ensures the campaign brief is not empty before saving.  The component tracks edits using the `isEditing` state variable.

* **Attachment management:**  It allows removal of attachments using `handleRemoveAttachment`, sending a DELETE request (path including `${DELETE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENT}?AttachId=${attachmentId}`).  Success and error messages are displayed to the user.

* **Tracking:**  It sends tracking data using `sendTrackingData` and `sendTrackingOnClose` functions upon closing the preview, if the draft type is "PreviewEmail".  This is done using an event listener for "beforeunload".

* **State management:** The component utilizes `useState` for managing loading state, editing state, draft data, email content, and other relevant variables.  `useRef` is used for managing references to textarea elements.  `useEffect` is extensively used for data fetching, template generation, and managing focus on textarea.  `useNotification` is used for displaying notifications to the user.

The code heavily relies on asynchronous operations and error handling, showing robust design for handling network requests and potential API issues.  The use of numerous `useEffect` hooks indicates a complex component with potentially multiple data dependencies and side effects.  The consistent use of `userService` suggests interaction with a backend service for data management.


## 4:13:05 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `EmailPreview.jsx` on August 7th, 2025, between 3:19 PM and 4:12 PM.  The code appears to be a React component for previewing emails, likely within a social media campaign management system.  There are no functional changes across all commits; the code remains largely the same throughout the series of commits.  The component fetches draft data (`GET_DRAFT_DATA`), allows editing of a campaign brief, and updates that data (`INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`). It also handles the removal of attachments (`DELETE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENT`).  The `userService` is used for API calls, and tracking data is sent using `sendTrackingData` and `sendTrackingOnClose` functions.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to sanitizing and formatting the email content and deliverables for display. The repetitive nature of the commits suggests minor adjustments or possibly iterative debugging rather than substantial feature additions.


## 5:13:05 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `EmailPreview.jsx` on August 7, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for displaying a preview of an email, likely within a social media campaign context.  The code heavily uses asynchronous operations (`userService.get`, `userService.put`, `userService.delete`) to fetch and update campaign data.  Data sanitization functions (`sanitizeContent`, `sanitizeDelivContent`) are employed to clean up content retrieved from the server.  The component interacts with a notification system (`useNotification`) to display feedback to the user.  Significant updates happened between 4:17 PM and 4:30 PM, with minor changes following.  There's repeated use of  `GET_DRAFT_DATA`, `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`, and `DELETE_INSTAGRAM_ATTACHMENT` constants, suggesting interaction with an Instagram campaign API or a similar backend service. The code generates an email template dynamically based on campaign details, including a table of deliverables.  The component also includes tracking functionality (`sendTrackingData`, `sendTrackingOnClose`) likely for analytics purposes.  The overall structure and functionality remained consistent across all revisions; the changes were likely bug fixes or minor improvements.


## 6:13:03 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `EmailPreview.jsx` on August 7th, 2025, between 5:32 PM and 5:48 PM.  The code is a React component responsible for rendering an email preview, likely for a social media campaign.  The component fetches draft data using `userService.get` from an endpoint related to `GET_DRAFT_DATA` and `campId`, sanitizes the content, and generates an email template based on this data.  This template includes a dynamically generated table of deliverables. The component allows editing of the campaign brief and email signature, updating the draft data via `userService.put` to an endpoint related to `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE`. Error handling and notifications are implemented using `useNotification`.  Tracking data is sent on close using `sendTrackingOnClose`. There are no substantial code changes between the revisions; all three later revisions appear to be essentially identical to the first. The  repeated identical code suggests that the commits might be redundant or the result of an interrupted save process.
