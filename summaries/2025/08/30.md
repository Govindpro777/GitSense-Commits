# Activity Summary for 8/30/2025

## 12:08:06 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `CampaignArticles.jsx` between 10:54 PM and 10:58 PM on August 29, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, possibly related to debugging or incremental improvements rather than substantial feature additions or refactoring.  The code itself is a React component that fetches and displays articles related to a campaign.  It uses various state variables to manage filters (keywords, spokespeople, topics), pagination (`currentPage`), loading state (`isLoading`), and date ranges for article filtering. The component makes API calls via `userService.post` to an endpoint defined by `ARTICLES_BY_JID` constant to retrieve articles. Error handling is implemented using a notification system (`useNotification`).  No significant functional changes are evident across the multiple commits; the code remains largely the same.  The repeated identical code snippets across the timestamps suggest that the changes may not have been fully saved or committed successfully in the initial attempts.


## 1:08:09 AM
The log shows a series of changes primarily focused on the `index.js` file and the addition of Swagger documentation generation.

Initially, `index.js` (8/29/2025, 11:35:40 PM) was a complete Express.js server application, handling various routes (`/api/v1/auth`, `/api/v1/admin`, etc.)  for different user roles (user, admin, designer, superAdmin), using  Socket.IO for real-time communication and including functionalities for file uploads. The `cors` configuration was updated to allow all origins.

Between 8/29/2025, 11:37:57 PM and 11:42:29 PM,  `index.js` underwent several iterations integrating `swagger-autogen`.  The initial attempts involved incorrect paths in the `routes` array for the Swagger configuration, which were corrected in the final revision (8/29/2025, 11:42:29 PM).  The `swaggerUi` middleware was moved after `fileUpload` and `database.connectWithDb()` in the last commit at 8/29/2025, 11:42:29 PM.  The location of the Swagger JSON file was changed from `swagger.json` to `swagger-output.json`.

A separate `swagger.js` file was created (8/30/2025, 12:59:53 AM) to handle Swagger documentation generation.  This file was initially incomplete, missing several route files in the `routes` array. Subsequent edits to `swagger.js` (8/30/2025, 1:03:50 AM and 1:04:26 AM) corrected this, ultimately specifying all the relevant route files in the routes array.  The paths were changed to correctly reference the route files.

Finally, the `package.json` file was modified (8/30/2025, 1:02:27 AM - 1:02:58 AM) to include a `generateDoc` script utilizing the `swagger.js` file, automating the Swagger documentation generation process. The `generateDoc` script was added to the `scripts` section.  An empty script was first added and then correctly defined to execute `node swagger.js`.  The `index.js` file (8/30/2025, 1:00:42 AM) was then updated to use `swagger-output.json` instead of `swagger.json`.


## 11:49:52 AM
The log shows several code changes between 1:30 AM and 1:37 AM on August 30, 2025.  The most significant changes involve the `index.js` file and the `.env` file.

The `.env` file underwent multiple revisions, primarily concerning the `PORT` variable.  The `PORT` variable was changed between 4000 and 3000 several times before settling on 4000.  Additionally, the `CLIENT_URL` was updated from `http://localhost:3000` to `http://localhost:5173` at 1:33:21 AM, indicating a shift in the client application's port.  The  `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` variables appear to be in development with commented-out alternative values.

The `swagger.js` file remained unchanged after its initial creation at 1:33:30 AM.

The `index.js` file saw a significant change in the `corsOptions` object between 1:35:16 AM and 1:37:01 AM.  Initially, it specified  allowed origins as `['http://localhost:5173', 'http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:4000']`,  but this was changed to a more flexible function `origin: function (origin, callback) { callback(null, origin); }`, allowing all origins. This change likely broadens access to the server, potentially for development purposes.  The change happened around 1:37:01 AM.  The `index.js` file sets up an Express.js server with various middleware (cors, cookie-parser, express-fileupload), connects to a database, sets up routes for different user roles (user, admin, superAdmin, designer), integrates Swagger UI for API documentation, and manages socket.io connections.


The changes indicate iterative development and testing, adjusting the server's configuration to accommodate different client ports and finally implementing a more open CORS policy.  The repeated modification of the `PORT` variable suggests debugging or testing with different port assignments.


## 12:49:48 PM
The log shows development activity on a Node.js application using Express.js, Socket.IO, and Swagger for API documentation.  Significant changes occurred between 12:10 PM and 12:25 PM on August 30, 2025.

The `swagger-output.json` file was repeatedly updated. These updates primarily involved changes to the `host` field, reflecting a shift from port 3000 to 4000,  which likely corresponds to changes made in the `swagger.js` file at approximately 12:16 PM and 12:17 PM. The `swagger.js` file updates only changed the host port from 3000 to 4000.  The `swagger-output.json` file defines the API specification, detailing various endpoints for managing leads and customers (CRUD operations), including authentication (`/accounts`,  `/auth/signup`, `/auth/login` etc.) and authorization using token-based authentication in headers and queries.  The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure.

The `index.js` file, which is the main application file, was updated at 12:22 PM and 12:23 PM, primarily affecting the root route handler (`/`)  and integrating Swagger UI for API documentation.  The file also shows configuration for CORS, file uploads, and Socket.IO with authentication middleware (`socketAuthenticator`). No major functional changes are observed here but the root route handler is modified.

The `user.routes.js` file underwent several updates between 12:24 PM and 12:25 PM. The primary change is the prefixing of all user-related routes with `/auth`. This change is likely related to better organization and clarity in the API structure.


The `account.routes.js` file defines a single route `/accounts`, protected by authentication and authorization middleware.  This route likely handles requests related to account management.  No change is reflected for this file.


Overall, the changes suggest iterative development focusing on refining the API's host configuration, enhancing route organization within the user module, and finalizing the setup of Swagger UI for documentation and development.


## 3:03:21 PM
The log shows several revisions to `GraphicsOrder.jsx` between 12:47 PM and 1:08 PM on August 30, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes centers around the `handleStatusUpdate` function.

Initially,  `handleStatusUpdate` was a simple function to update order status.  Later revisions introduced crucial validation before updating an order to "graphics_completed".  The first revision at 12:48 PM added a check to ensure both `image` and `cadFiles` arrays were populated before allowing the status change.  A subsequent revision at 1:07 PM and another at 1:08 PM refined this validation, first by clarifying the condition's logic, and then finally simplifying it to only check if the `image` array exists and contains at least one element, as the `cadFiles` field was not available in the API response.  In all cases,  an error toast message is shown to the user if the validation fails, preventing the premature completion of an order.  No other significant changes are observed in the file besides this validation logic within the `handleStatusUpdate` function.


## 10:53:07 PM
The log shows updates to both frontend and backend components of an application managing orders and leads.

**Frontend Changes:**

* **`GraphicsOrder.jsx` (8/30/2025, 3:17:31 PM):** This component displays and manages graphics orders.  Significant changes include updating the `handleStatusUpdate` function to only check for image uploads before marking an order as "graphics_completed," improving error handling and user feedback with `react-hot-toast`.  The component uses `socket.io-client` for real-time updates, fetching orders from an API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/assigned`), and implementing pagination.  It also includes modals for image preview and file uploads.

* **`CreateNewOrderv2.jsx` (8/30/2025, 3:48:30 PM):** This component allows creating new orders.  Key improvements involve enhanced customer management: it now allows creating new customers directly within the order creation form or selecting from existing ones using custom hooks (`useCustomers`, `useGraphicsUsers`). Input validation has been added to ensure required fields are completed before submission. The component handles image uploads and uses `react-hot-toast` for feedback.


* **`Leads.jsx` (8/30/2025, 3:48:45 PM):** This component manages leads, allowing for creation, editing, deletion and conversion to customers. It fetches leads from `/api/v1/admin/getAllLeads`, uses `axios` for API calls, and displays leads in a table with filtering and search capabilities.  Modals handle lead addition, editing, and conversion, providing user feedback via `react-hot-toast`.

**Backend Changes:**

* **`graphics.controller.js` (8/30/2025, 3:24:14 PM, 3:47:55 PM, 3:48:07 PM):** This controller handles requests related to graphics orders.  The `createOrder` function underwent substantial revision across multiple commits.  Initial commits involved setting up the controller structure, including functions for finding available graphics users, sending assignment notifications using `socketManager`, calculating order priority and estimated completion time.  Later commits focused on improving the order creation process by adding input validation for required fields (requirements, dimensions, images), handling new and existing customer scenarios, and managing transactions using `mongoose.startSession`.  The addition of error handling and more robust input validation are evident.  It uses various models (`Order`, `Cad`, `WorkQueue`, `User`, `Customer`, `Address`, `notification`), and libraries like `mongoose`, `Agenda`, `dotenv`, and `moment-timezone`.


A recurring pattern is the use of `react-hot-toast` for user feedback in the frontend and consistent API endpoint usage (`/api/v1/admin/...`) across the frontend and backend.  The backend also shows a progressive refinement of the `createOrder` function across multiple commits, indicating an iterative development process.
