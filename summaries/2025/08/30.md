# Activity Summary for 8/30/2025

## 12:08:06 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `CampaignArticles.jsx` between 10:54 PM and 10:58 PM on August 29, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, possibly related to debugging or incremental improvements rather than substantial feature additions or refactoring.  The code itself is a React component that fetches and displays articles related to a campaign.  It uses various state variables to manage filters (keywords, spokespeople, topics), pagination (`currentPage`), loading state (`isLoading`), and date ranges for article filtering. The component makes API calls via `userService.post` to an endpoint defined by `ARTICLES_BY_JID` constant to retrieve articles. Error handling is implemented using a notification system (`useNotification`).  No significant functional changes are evident across the multiple commits; the code remains largely the same.  The repeated identical code snippets across the timestamps suggest that the changes may not have been fully saved or committed successfully in the initial attempts.
