# Activity Summary for 8/30/2025

## 12:08:06 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `CampaignArticles.jsx` between 10:54 PM and 10:58 PM on August 29, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, possibly related to debugging or incremental improvements rather than substantial feature additions or refactoring.  The code itself is a React component that fetches and displays articles related to a campaign.  It uses various state variables to manage filters (keywords, spokespeople, topics), pagination (`currentPage`), loading state (`isLoading`), and date ranges for article filtering. The component makes API calls via `userService.post` to an endpoint defined by `ARTICLES_BY_JID` constant to retrieve articles. Error handling is implemented using a notification system (`useNotification`).  No significant functional changes are evident across the multiple commits; the code remains largely the same.  The repeated identical code snippets across the timestamps suggest that the changes may not have been fully saved or committed successfully in the initial attempts.


## 1:08:09 AM
The log shows a series of changes primarily focused on the `index.js` file and the addition of Swagger documentation generation.

Initially, `index.js` (8/29/2025, 11:35:40 PM) was a complete Express.js server application, handling various routes (`/api/v1/auth`, `/api/v1/admin`, etc.)  for different user roles (user, admin, designer, superAdmin), using  Socket.IO for real-time communication and including functionalities for file uploads. The `cors` configuration was updated to allow all origins.

Between 8/29/2025, 11:37:57 PM and 11:42:29 PM,  `index.js` underwent several iterations integrating `swagger-autogen`.  The initial attempts involved incorrect paths in the `routes` array for the Swagger configuration, which were corrected in the final revision (8/29/2025, 11:42:29 PM).  The `swaggerUi` middleware was moved after `fileUpload` and `database.connectWithDb()` in the last commit at 8/29/2025, 11:42:29 PM.  The location of the Swagger JSON file was changed from `swagger.json` to `swagger-output.json`.

A separate `swagger.js` file was created (8/30/2025, 12:59:53 AM) to handle Swagger documentation generation.  This file was initially incomplete, missing several route files in the `routes` array. Subsequent edits to `swagger.js` (8/30/2025, 1:03:50 AM and 1:04:26 AM) corrected this, ultimately specifying all the relevant route files in the routes array.  The paths were changed to correctly reference the route files.

Finally, the `package.json` file was modified (8/30/2025, 1:02:27 AM - 1:02:58 AM) to include a `generateDoc` script utilizing the `swagger.js` file, automating the Swagger documentation generation process. The `generateDoc` script was added to the `scripts` section.  An empty script was first added and then correctly defined to execute `node swagger.js`.  The `index.js` file (8/30/2025, 1:00:42 AM) was then updated to use `swagger-output.json` instead of `swagger.json`.


## 11:49:52 AM
The log shows several code changes between 1:30 AM and 1:37 AM on August 30, 2025.  The most significant changes involve the `index.js` file and the `.env` file.

The `.env` file underwent multiple revisions, primarily concerning the `PORT` variable.  The `PORT` variable was changed between 4000 and 3000 several times before settling on 4000.  Additionally, the `CLIENT_URL` was updated from `http://localhost:3000` to `http://localhost:5173` at 1:33:21 AM, indicating a shift in the client application's port.  The  `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` variables appear to be in development with commented-out alternative values.

The `swagger.js` file remained unchanged after its initial creation at 1:33:30 AM.

The `index.js` file saw a significant change in the `corsOptions` object between 1:35:16 AM and 1:37:01 AM.  Initially, it specified  allowed origins as `['http://localhost:5173', 'http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:4000']`,  but this was changed to a more flexible function `origin: function (origin, callback) { callback(null, origin); }`, allowing all origins. This change likely broadens access to the server, potentially for development purposes.  The change happened around 1:37:01 AM.  The `index.js` file sets up an Express.js server with various middleware (cors, cookie-parser, express-fileupload), connects to a database, sets up routes for different user roles (user, admin, superAdmin, designer), integrates Swagger UI for API documentation, and manages socket.io connections.


The changes indicate iterative development and testing, adjusting the server's configuration to accommodate different client ports and finally implementing a more open CORS policy.  The repeated modification of the `PORT` variable suggests debugging or testing with different port assignments.
