# Activity Summary for 8/4/2025

## 12:32:58 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Signup.jsx` component between August 3rd and 4th, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged across all revisions; it's a React component for user signup, featuring:

* **Early Access Handling:** The component handles both standard signup and early access signup using a token (`searchParams.get('id')`).  It fetches early access information using a `userService.get` call to the `/EARLY_ACCESS_INFO` endpoint.

* **OTP Verification:** A four-digit OTP is implemented with input field focusing and paste handling.

* **Input Validation:**  Comprehensive input validation is present, checking for minimum lengths of organization name and user name, valid email addresses (rejecting public email domains unless it's early access), 10-digit phone numbers, and a strong password using a regular expression.

* **State Management:**  The component uses React's `useState` extensively to manage various aspects of the signup process, including user input, loading state, and error messages.

* **Data Handling:**  It clears local storage of `user` and `userInfo` on component mount and stores user information received from the early access API call.


The timestamps indicate several minor edits were made in quick succession around 11:33 PM, 11:36 PM, and 11:39 PM on August 3rd.  Then, there were two more minor changes around 12:23 AM and 12:26 AM on August 4th.  The code within the component itself did not change during these revisions.  It is likely these edits were related to debugging or minor formatting changes rather than functional updates.


## 1:33:03 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `Signup.jsx` between 12:34 AM and 1:19 AM on August 4th, 2025.  The file is a React component handling user signup, incorporating features like early access token handling, OTP verification, and client-side input validation.  There are no apparent changes in the file's overall structure or functionality across all revisions; instead, the modifications seem focused on refining the existing code.

The `user.service.js` file, modified once at 12:44 AM, appears to be a service for making API calls, handling authentication using access tokens retrieved from `token.service`.  It provides methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

The `Signup.jsx` file consistently utilizes numerous React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`) and Next.js navigation hooks (`useSearchParams`, `useRouter`).  It interacts with a `userService` for API calls related to user information and early access, referencing constants like `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO` and `USERINFO`.  The code manages user input for various fields (organization name, email, phone number, password, OTP), performs validation, and handles the signup process.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative improvements and bug fixes throughout the development process.  The majority of edits focus on the input validation and error handling within the `handleSignup` function.


## 4:56:46 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\BeforeLogin\Auth\Signup.jsx` between 1:38 AM and 1:50 AM on August 4th, 2025.  The file is a React component for user signup, handling both regular signup and early access signup via a token.  The code remains largely unchanged across all revisions; the differences are likely minor formatting adjustments or very subtle code changes not easily discernible from the provided commented-out code snippets.  The component uses various React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`), Next.js navigation (`useRouter`, `useSearchParams`), and a custom `userService` for API interactions.  Key features include:

* **Early Access Handling:** The component checks for an `id` token in the URL search parameters. If present, it fetches early access information using the `fetchEarlyAccessInfo` function and populates the `accountDetail` state accordingly.

* **OTP Input:** It includes an OTP input mechanism with automatic field focus and paste handling.

* **Input Validation:**  The `handleSignup` function performs extensive validation on user inputs (organization name, name, email, phone number, and password), showing notifications for errors.  A regular expression ensures password strength.

* **Data Storage:** The component removes any existing "user" and "userInfo" data from `localStorage` on mount.


There is no significant structural change to the code across these revisions. The timestamps suggest a period of active development and testing, with frequent saves or commits.


## 4:56:53 AM
The `SignUp.jsx` component, last modified on 8/4/2025, 1:32:32 AM, handles user sign-up functionality.  It features extensive input validation for organization name, user name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password (requiring at least 8 characters, an uppercase letter, a number, and a special character).  The password must also match a confirmation password.  The code uses a state management system to track input values, error messages, loading status, and OTP verification.  An OTP (One-Time Password) system is integrated, handling input via four separate input fields.  Error messages are displayed conditionally based on validation results.  The component interacts with backend services (`userService`) to create a user account (`FREESIGNUP` endpoint) and retrieve user information (`USERINFO` endpoint).  Local storage is used (though subsequently cleared on mount) likely for temporary user information storage.  The code includes functions for handling paste events and email domain validation, using a predefined list of public email domains.  The `useMetadata` hook suggests integration for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).


## 10:01:35 AM
The log shows two entries for `SignUp.jsx`, both at 8/4/2025, with a four-minute difference.  The code is identical in both entries, representing a React component for user signup.  The component handles user input validation, including checks for email format (rejecting public email domains), password complexity, and OTP verification.  It uses a `userService` for API calls (`FREESIGNUP` and `USERINFO` endpoints) and local storage to manage user information.  There are no actual code changes between the two timestamps; the log likely reflects a version control system's recording of the same code twice, perhaps due to a failed commit or similar operation.


## 10:01:36 AM
The `Signup.jsx` component underwent significant changes on August 4th, 2025, at 9:12:35 AM.  The code implements a user signup form with features for both early access users (via a token) and standard users.  The component manages user input for organization name, email, phone number, name, password, and a 4-digit OTP.  Extensive validation is performed on these fields, checking for minimum lengths, password complexity, and whether the email is a public domain email (only allowed for early access users).  Early access information is fetched using a token from the URL parameters via a call to `userService.get()`. If successful, the component populates the form with the received data.  Upon successful signup (handled in the `handleSignup` function), it redirects to '/summary'.  The component uses React's useState hook extensively for managing the form's state, including loading indicators and error messages, uses several useEffect hooks for managing side effects like cleanup, form input focus, and OTP handling and local storage cleanup. A countdown timer is implemented to display remaining time for OTP verification, however the functionality appears to be incomplete or commented out. The component also incorporates error handling and user feedback through notification alerts.  The code uses several external services/libraries, including `userService`, `useNotification`, `useRouter`, and `useSearchParams`.  The local storage is used to store user information temporarily which is cleaned up on component mount.


## 11:01:35 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `SignUp.jsx` component, all on August 4th, 2025.  The code consistently implements a user signup form with features like OTP verification and validation checks for various fields (organization name, email, phone number, password).

The revisions appear to focus on refinements and error handling rather than major structural changes.  All three timestamps reflect the same file contents; there are no discernible changes in the code across the three versions logged. The timestamps (10:01:40 AM, 10:04:05 AM, and 10:50:09 AM) likely represent  multiple saves or commits of the same code within the IDE or version control system without actual changes to the file's content.  The component uses React hooks for state management and makes API calls to a `userService` for signup and user information retrieval.  Input validation is extensive, checking for minimum lengths, password complexity, and disallowing public email domains.  Error messages are dynamically displayed based on validation results.


## 11:01:37 AM
The `Signup.jsx` component, last updated on 8/4/2025 at 10:13:15 AM, handles user signup functionality.  It uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) and Next.js navigation (`useRouter`, `useSearchParams`). The code manages user input for organization name, email, phone number, name, password, and a 4-digit OTP.  It performs client-side validation, checking for minimum lengths and password complexity.  A key feature is handling early access signup via a token obtained from URL parameters (`searchParams.get('id')`).  Early access information is fetched using `userService.get(`${EARLY_ACCESS_INFO}?token=${accessToken}`)`, populating the form fields. The component also includes a countdown timer for OTP entry,  and removes locally stored user data on mount. After successful validation, it makes a signup request (the full payload is not shown, but the fields are indicated). The code extensively uses state variables to manage various aspects of the form, including loading states, error handling (using `useNotification`), and input field focus management.  Error notifications are displayed using a custom hook.  The signup process seems to involve backend interaction via the `userService`.  The code incorporates several helper functions such as `isPublicEmail` for email validation and `countdownTimer` for managing the OTP timer.  The `handleSignup` function orchestrates the validation and API call.


## 11:02:17 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `SOCIAL.html` between 10:11 AM and 10:36 AM on August 4th, 2025.  The core content remained consistent—an email announcing the launch of Socion, a platform for influencer marketing, and highlighting its key features.  The changes primarily focused on styling and layout adjustments.

Specifically:

* **10:11 AM:** The initial version of the HTML was created, using inline styles extensively for layout and visual elements.

* **10:18 AM:**  Google Fonts ("Inter" and "Source Sans 3") were integrated, and inline styles were used to apply these fonts to the body of the email.

* **10:28 AM - 10:33 AM:** The `@import` statement for Google Fonts was replaced with a `<link>` tag for better semantics. Several minor adjustments to the styling followed during this period (e.g., adding box-shadow, adjusting padding, and adding a border to the table).  These changes primarily involved refinements to the visual appearance of the email, particularly the table containing the features of Socion.  Padding adjustments are observed in the Left Column of the table.


* **10:33 AM - 10:36 AM:** Further refinements to the padding within the left column of a table were made in several commits, suggesting iterative adjustments to spacing.


* **10:35 AM - 10:36 AM:**  The "Powered by Skribe" section, initially commented out, was uncommented and restyled, changing font color and size, indicating a final decision to include the attribution. The color was changed from `#64748b` to `#444444` and the font size was increased from `13px` to `16px`.  The strong tag color also changed from `#1e40af` to just black.


Throughout the changes, the underlying structure of the HTML using nested tables remained unchanged, demonstrating a commitment to a table-based email layout.  The relatively rapid series of edits after the inclusion of Google Fonts indicates a period of iterative design refinement.


## 12:01:43 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `SignUp.jsx`  between 11:07 AM and 11:53 AM on August 4th, 2025.  These updates appear to be incremental changes, possibly related to bug fixes or minor feature adjustments, as the core functionality remains consistent throughout.  The code within `SignUp.jsx`  is a React component handling user signup, including validation for organization name, name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password. It uses a custom OTP input system and interacts with backend services (`userService`) for user information retrieval and signup (`FREESIGNUP`, `USERINFO` constants).  There are also several commented-out sections of code.

Between 11:55 AM and 11:59 AM, changes were made to `layout.jsx`.  Initially, Google Analytics and Clarity tracking scripts were commented out.  Later, `ErrorAlerts` was added to the component tree.


Finally, at 12:00 PM, `ErrorAlerts.jsx` received an update, likely improving its functionality or styling. The `ErrorAlerts` component renders a notification based on the type ("error", "warning", "success") and includes material icons for visual cues.  It fades out automatically after 3 seconds.  The addition of `"use client";` to `ErrorAlerts.jsx` suggests a change to support React Server Components.


## 1:01:37 PM
The log shows three consecutive updates to `SignUp.jsx` on August 4th, 2025.  The code in all three entries is identical, suggesting that the timestamps represent failed attempts to save the changes, or that the changes were reverted after each commit.  The file contains React code for a user sign-up form.  Key features include:

* **Client-side rendering:** Indicated by the commented-out `"use client";` line.
* **User input validation:** Extensive checks are in place to ensure valid organization name, name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password formats.  Password complexity requirements are explicitly defined.
* **OTP (One-Time Password) implementation:**  The code manages an OTP input field with automatic focus shifting between fields, handling paste events, and assembling the full OTP from individual inputs.
* **API calls:** Uses `userService` to make requests to `/userinfo` and `FREESIGNUP` endpoints for user information retrieval and account creation respectively.
* **Error handling:** Uses state variables (`visible`, `message`) to display error messages to the user after failed validation or API calls.  It clears local storage items ("user" and "userInfo").


The lack of changes between the three log entries suggests a problem with the saving or version control process rather than significant code evolution.  The timestamp sequence indicates the attempts were clustered within a short timeframe (around 6 minutes).


## 2:02:26 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files, `SOCIAL.html` and `Socion2.html`, between 1:04 PM and 2:01 PM on August 4th, 2025.  Both files contain very similar HTML code designed for email marketing, promoting a platform called "Socion," powered by "skribe."

`SOCIAL.html` underwent the most significant changes.  Early revisions involved primarily stylistic adjustments and structural changes to the layout, using nested tables for email compatibility.  There were several iterations involving the height of the header image section, moving from a `div` based layout to a table-based one for better email client support and adjusting the padding and margins for optimal visual appeal.  A notable change around 1:29 PM involved a shift in header structure, replacing a `div` containing the header elements with a background image and overlaying the text. Further revisions around 1:50 PM involved adding a Skribe logo in the header.  The final version (1:53 PM onwards) incorporates a logo, refined padding in the header, and a consistent visual style.


`Socion2.html` shows fewer revisions. The main difference between its versions is the background image used in the header section (`socion-mailer8.png` replaces `socion-mailer7.png`), and a change in the header text color from white to black around 1:13 PM. The button color changed from #012B5B to #E86D70  around 1:14 PM and later changes involved the background color of a section, and  text color adjustments.  No structural changes were made to `Socion2.html` unlike `SOCIAL.html`.

The repeated use of nested tables throughout both files indicates a focus on email client compatibility.  The frequent modifications suggest iterative design refinement based on testing or feedback.  The consistent use of images for branding and stylistic elements (`socion-mailer3.png`, `socion-mailer4.png`, `socion-mailer6.png`, `socion-mailer7.png`, `socion-mailer8.png`, `blueInsta.png`, `blueX.png`, `blueLinkedin.png`, `facebook.png` and  `logo.png`) highlights the importance of visual design in the marketing campaign.


## 3:01:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `SignUp.jsx` component between 2:39 PM and 3:00 PM on August 4th, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged across these revisions; all three entries contain the same commented-out React component code for user signup.  This suggests that the changes might be related to version control or temporary edits rather than substantive code modifications.  No functional changes to the signup component are evident in these specific log entries.


## 3:01:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files, `SOCIAL.html` and `Socion3.html`,  between approximately 2:03 PM and 2:23 PM on August 4th, 2025.  Both files are email templates focused on promoting "Socion," an influencer marketing platform.


`SOCIAL.html` underwent two revisions. The first (2:03 PM) created the initial template with a visually appealing design, featuring a background image, a logo, headlines, and a call to action ("Start Exploring"). The second revision (2:06 PM) appears to be a minor adjustment, possibly correcting some styling or structure.  No major content changes occurred in `SOCIAL.html`


`Socion3.html` underwent several revisions over a longer period.  Initially (2:13 PM), the file was similar in structure to `SOCIAL.html`, but with a different color scheme and a change in the top headline and subheading, transitioning from a "You're In!" message to one announcing Socion's upcoming launch. Subsequent changes focused on:

* **Refinement of Features:** The bullet points describing Socion's features were significantly improved, adding specificity and clarity around influencer discovery, validation and performance tracking. (2:14 PM onwards)
* **Call-to-Action Adjustments:** The call to action shifted from "Start Exploring" to "Join the waitlist now", reflecting the changing message around Socion's launch status. (2:21 PM onwards)
* **Visual Changes:**  There were several minor styling changes throughout the template, including the removal of an image, alteration of color schemes, and padding adjustments.  The initial logo changed from the Skribe logo to the Socion logo. (2:07 PM onwards, then several more changes)
* **Footer Enhancement:** The Footer was made more concise by reducing the header copy. (2:16 pm onwards)

A common pattern is the extensive use of nested tables for layout, a common practice in older email design to ensure consistent rendering across various email clients.  The iterative nature of the changes suggests a design and content refinement process leading up to the launch announcement for Socion.


## 4:01:37 PM
The `Signup.jsx` component underwent significant changes on August 4th, 2025, at 3:58:39 PM.  The code implements a user signup form with features for both early access users (via a token) and standard users.  The form handles user input for organization name, email, phone number, name, password, and a 4-digit OTP (One-Time Password).

Key updates include:

* **Input Validation:**  Extensive client-side validation is implemented, checking for minimum lengths of organization name and user name (3 characters), valid email format, 10-digit phone number, and a strong password (at least 8 characters, uppercase letter, number, and special character).  It also specifically prevents signup using public email domains unless early access is granted.
* **Early Access Flow:**  The component handles a separate flow for users with an early access token.  It fetches user information based on the token, pre-filling the form with retrieved data.  Error handling is included for invalid or expired tokens.
* **OTP Implementation:** The component includes an OTP input field, with functionality to automatically advance to the next field after each digit is entered and handles pasting of OTP.  A countdown timer is implemented for OTP entry.
* **State Management:**  The component uses React's `useState` hook extensively to manage the form's state, including loading indicators and error messages.
* **User Service Integration:**  The code interacts with a `userService` to fetch early access information and handle user signup.  The results are stored locally before redirection to a summary page.
* **Local Storage Handling:** The component removes any existing user data from local storage upon initial render.
* **Error Handling and Notifications:** The component uses a custom notification system (`useNotification`) to provide feedback to the user on successes, warnings, and errors.


The component's structure suggests a modular design, though it's heavily contained within a single file, indicating potential benefits from further refactoring for better maintainability.  The numerous `useEffect` calls could warrant examination for potential optimization.


## 4:01:53 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to two HTML files, `SOCIAL.html` and `Socion2.html`, over a short period on August 4th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve styling and image updates within email templates.

`SOCIAL.html` underwent numerous revisions between 3:06 PM and 3:09 PM, focusing on adjustments to the `background-size` property of a background image.  The `background-size` property was experimented with using values like `100%`, `100% 100%`, `80% 100%`, and finally settling on `100% 100%`.  Minor changes to padding within the logo image's margin also occurred during this time.  Later changes between 3:09PM and 3:17PM involved altering the `max-width` of the email, adjusting padding, and replacing the background image with a local file (`bg-lap.png`) then reverting it back to a URL `('https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/socion-mailer7.png')`.

`Socion2.html` was created around 3:18 PM and subsequently modified until 3:54 PM.  The majority of changes in `Socion2.html` involved styling elements such as colors (#012B5B, #E86D70, #FBF0D9),  font sizes, and image placement.  The background image source was changed several times, starting with `bg-lap.png`, then shifting to `'https://ucarecdn.com/8c449414-2131-4bcc-bc36-bfc3357bd6c5/bg.png'`, and finally `'https://ucarecdn.com/9b76b8aa-a5fd-4052-932a-db001c3b86d8/socionmailer10.png'`  along with an image replacement in the body.  Also, the `height` of the laptop image was adjusted multiple times. A noticeable pattern is the consistent use of nested tables for layout.  Both files share a common structure and many stylistic elements, suggesting they are related email templates.  The `Socion3.html` file also shows very similar structure and styles, only differing on its content and background image.  The final changes in `Socion2.html` focused on color adjustments for better visual appeal.  The color of the header `Socion` was adjusted from black to a darker shade of blue (`#012B5B`).


## 5:01:49 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of HTML email templates, primarily focusing on two  newsletter types: a weekly newsletter (`WEEKLY_4.html`) and announcements regarding a new platform called "Socion" (`SOCIAL.html` and `Socion2.html`, `Socion3.html`).

`WEEKLY_4.html` (8/4/2025, 4:33:21 PM): This file represents a weekly newsletter showcasing blog posts ("7 Smart Ways to Maximize the ROI of Your Earned Media Coverage" and "Outreach Errors That Cost Brands Coverage") and a call to action for booking a demo or press release distribution. The HTML uses extensive inline styling and tables for layout.  The stylesheet includes responsive design elements using `clamp()` for dynamic sizing and media queries for mobile optimization.

`SOCIAL.html` (Multiple Revisions):  This file is repeatedly modified between 4:33:31 PM and 4:52:01 PM. The core content remains consistent: an announcement for the launch of Socion, a platform for influencer marketing.  The changes primarily involve adjustments to background colors (from #ccc to white and back),  the overall structure, and the addition of an unsubscribe link at the end.  The use of tables for layout is consistent across all revisions.

`Socion2.html` (Multiple Revisions):  This file, also related to the Socion launch announcement, undergoes several revisions between 4:52:31 PM and 4:56:25 PM.  Similar to `SOCIAL.html`, the modifications center around background colors (shifting between #ccc and white) and the addition of an unsubscribe link. The images used are sourced from `ucarecdn.com`, unlike the other files which primarily use `beta-app.goskribe.com` and `www.goskribe.com`.


`Socion3.html` (Multiple Revisions): This file, another version of the Socion announcement, is revised between 4:50:18 PM and 4:56:55 PM.  The modifications are similar to those in `SOCIAL.html` and `Socion2.html`, primarily concerning background color and the addition of an unsubscribe link. It features different image URLs compared to `Socion2.html`.

Recurring Elements:  Across all files, there's a consistent use of tables for email layout, inline styles, and links to `beta-app.goskribe.com`, `www.goskribe.com`, and other external resources for images and fonts. The color palette remains consistent using shades of blue (#002B5B, #012b5b) and a pinkish purple (#d0b6f6) across all versions of the email templates.  All the email templates include social media icons linking to Goskribe's profiles.


## 5:04:24 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Signup.jsx` between 4:05 PM and 4:24 PM on August 4th, 2025.  The file contains React code for a signup form.  No functional changes are apparent in the provided snippets; only the component name changed from `SocialSignup` to `Signup` in the last commit at 4:24:28 PM.  The code implements features such as:

* **OTP Input:**  The component manages a 4-digit OTP input field with auto-focus and paste handling.
* **Early Access:** It fetches user information based on an access token (`id` in URL parameters) and populates the form.  It removes any existing user data from localStorage upon component mount.
* **Input Validation:**  Extensive input validation is performed on organization name, name, email (checking for public email providers), phone number, and password strength before submitting the signup form.  Public email domains are hardcoded into a list.
* **Error Handling:** The code uses a custom notification hook (`useNotification`) for displaying success and error messages.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** It uses `async/await` for making API calls to fetch early access information and handle user signup.

The code remains largely unchanged across revisions. The only visible change is the renaming of the component.  The repeated identical code suggests that the updates might represent a series of autosaves or temporary edits rather than substantial code changes.


## 6:01:42 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `Socion3.html`, an HTML file likely used for an email or web page related to a product called Socion.  All revisions maintain the core structure: a responsive email template featuring a header image, introductory text announcing Socion's launch, key features listed in a table, a footer with social media links and branding, and an unsubscribe section.

The file was modified three times on August 4th, 2025.  The first two revisions (5:06 PM and 5:06:49 PM) appear to be nearly identical, suggesting a minor, possibly inconsequential change—perhaps an accidental save. The most significant change occurred between the second and third revisions (5:06:49 PM and 5:25:41 PM). This revision involved a minor styling update in the footer section. Specifically, the padding within the `<td>` element containing  "No messy spreadsheets. No blind bets. Just smarter workflows." was altered from `padding: 16px 40px;` to `padding: 10px 40px;`.  The overall content remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on the launch of Socion and highlighting its benefits.


## 11:59:35 PM
The log shows updates to the frontend (`Leads.jsx`) and backend (`app.js`) of an ERP CRM application.

**`Leads.jsx` (Frontend):**

Two commits are recorded for `Leads.jsx`. The first commit (8/4/2025, 11:29:48 PM) shows a complete React component for managing leads, including features like searching, filtering by status and source, adding new leads, deleting leads, and toggling lead status.  The component fetches lead data from an API endpoint (`/api/v1/lead`), handles authentication using a JWT token stored in localStorage, and provides a user interface for interacting with the leads. It utilizes various React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), and icon libraries (`react-icons`, `lucide-react`).

The second commit (8/4/2025, 11:52:35 PM) completely removes the code present in the first commit, essentially deleting the component. This suggests a possible rollback or significant refactoring.


**`app.js` (Backend):**

Three commits are recorded for `app.js`.  All three commits show minimal changes, primarily involving minor formatting adjustments to the code related to imports and spacing.  The core functionality of the Express.js backend remains consistent across all three commits.  The backend handles routing for authentication, API calls, downloads, and public assets, uses middleware like `cors`, `cookieParser`, `express.json`, `compression`, and `express-fileupload`. The backend also connects to Cloudinary and uses a custom authentication middleware (`adminAuth.isValidAuthToken`).  The changes across the three commits are inconsequential to the overall functionality.  The timestamps (8/4/2025, 11:54:38 PM, 11:55:13 PM, 11:56:51 PM) show these minor updates were made within a short time period.


In summary, the most significant change is the complete removal of the `Leads.jsx` component, suggesting a potential issue requiring a significant code revision or possibly a temporary deletion during development.  The backend (`app.js`) modifications are superficial and do not affect its core functionality.
