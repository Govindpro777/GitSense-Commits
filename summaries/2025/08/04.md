# Activity Summary for 8/4/2025

## 12:32:58 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Signup.jsx` component between August 3rd and 4th, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged across all revisions; it's a React component for user signup, featuring:

* **Early Access Handling:** The component handles both standard signup and early access signup using a token (`searchParams.get('id')`).  It fetches early access information using a `userService.get` call to the `/EARLY_ACCESS_INFO` endpoint.

* **OTP Verification:** A four-digit OTP is implemented with input field focusing and paste handling.

* **Input Validation:**  Comprehensive input validation is present, checking for minimum lengths of organization name and user name, valid email addresses (rejecting public email domains unless it's early access), 10-digit phone numbers, and a strong password using a regular expression.

* **State Management:**  The component uses React's `useState` extensively to manage various aspects of the signup process, including user input, loading state, and error messages.

* **Data Handling:**  It clears local storage of `user` and `userInfo` on component mount and stores user information received from the early access API call.


The timestamps indicate several minor edits were made in quick succession around 11:33 PM, 11:36 PM, and 11:39 PM on August 3rd.  Then, there were two more minor changes around 12:23 AM and 12:26 AM on August 4th.  The code within the component itself did not change during these revisions.  It is likely these edits were related to debugging or minor formatting changes rather than functional updates.


## 1:33:03 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `Signup.jsx` between 12:34 AM and 1:19 AM on August 4th, 2025.  The file is a React component handling user signup, incorporating features like early access token handling, OTP verification, and client-side input validation.  There are no apparent changes in the file's overall structure or functionality across all revisions; instead, the modifications seem focused on refining the existing code.

The `user.service.js` file, modified once at 12:44 AM, appears to be a service for making API calls, handling authentication using access tokens retrieved from `token.service`.  It provides methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

The `Signup.jsx` file consistently utilizes numerous React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`) and Next.js navigation hooks (`useSearchParams`, `useRouter`).  It interacts with a `userService` for API calls related to user information and early access, referencing constants like `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO` and `USERINFO`.  The code manages user input for various fields (organization name, email, phone number, password, OTP), performs validation, and handles the signup process.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative improvements and bug fixes throughout the development process.  The majority of edits focus on the input validation and error handling within the `handleSignup` function.


## 4:56:46 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\BeforeLogin\Auth\Signup.jsx` between 1:38 AM and 1:50 AM on August 4th, 2025.  The file is a React component for user signup, handling both regular signup and early access signup via a token.  The code remains largely unchanged across all revisions; the differences are likely minor formatting adjustments or very subtle code changes not easily discernible from the provided commented-out code snippets.  The component uses various React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`), Next.js navigation (`useRouter`, `useSearchParams`), and a custom `userService` for API interactions.  Key features include:

* **Early Access Handling:** The component checks for an `id` token in the URL search parameters. If present, it fetches early access information using the `fetchEarlyAccessInfo` function and populates the `accountDetail` state accordingly.

* **OTP Input:** It includes an OTP input mechanism with automatic field focus and paste handling.

* **Input Validation:**  The `handleSignup` function performs extensive validation on user inputs (organization name, name, email, phone number, and password), showing notifications for errors.  A regular expression ensures password strength.

* **Data Storage:** The component removes any existing "user" and "userInfo" data from `localStorage` on mount.


There is no significant structural change to the code across these revisions. The timestamps suggest a period of active development and testing, with frequent saves or commits.


## 4:56:53 AM
The `SignUp.jsx` component, last modified on 8/4/2025, 1:32:32 AM, handles user sign-up functionality.  It features extensive input validation for organization name, user name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password (requiring at least 8 characters, an uppercase letter, a number, and a special character).  The password must also match a confirmation password.  The code uses a state management system to track input values, error messages, loading status, and OTP verification.  An OTP (One-Time Password) system is integrated, handling input via four separate input fields.  Error messages are displayed conditionally based on validation results.  The component interacts with backend services (`userService`) to create a user account (`FREESIGNUP` endpoint) and retrieve user information (`USERINFO` endpoint).  Local storage is used (though subsequently cleared on mount) likely for temporary user information storage.  The code includes functions for handling paste events and email domain validation, using a predefined list of public email domains.  The `useMetadata` hook suggests integration for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).


## 10:01:35 AM
The log shows two entries for `SignUp.jsx`, both at 8/4/2025, with a four-minute difference.  The code is identical in both entries, representing a React component for user signup.  The component handles user input validation, including checks for email format (rejecting public email domains), password complexity, and OTP verification.  It uses a `userService` for API calls (`FREESIGNUP` and `USERINFO` endpoints) and local storage to manage user information.  There are no actual code changes between the two timestamps; the log likely reflects a version control system's recording of the same code twice, perhaps due to a failed commit or similar operation.
