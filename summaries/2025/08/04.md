# Activity Summary for 8/4/2025

## 12:32:58 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Signup.jsx` component between August 3rd and 4th, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged across all revisions; it's a React component for user signup, featuring:

* **Early Access Handling:** The component handles both standard signup and early access signup using a token (`searchParams.get('id')`).  It fetches early access information using a `userService.get` call to the `/EARLY_ACCESS_INFO` endpoint.

* **OTP Verification:** A four-digit OTP is implemented with input field focusing and paste handling.

* **Input Validation:**  Comprehensive input validation is present, checking for minimum lengths of organization name and user name, valid email addresses (rejecting public email domains unless it's early access), 10-digit phone numbers, and a strong password using a regular expression.

* **State Management:**  The component uses React's `useState` extensively to manage various aspects of the signup process, including user input, loading state, and error messages.

* **Data Handling:**  It clears local storage of `user` and `userInfo` on component mount and stores user information received from the early access API call.


The timestamps indicate several minor edits were made in quick succession around 11:33 PM, 11:36 PM, and 11:39 PM on August 3rd.  Then, there were two more minor changes around 12:23 AM and 12:26 AM on August 4th.  The code within the component itself did not change during these revisions.  It is likely these edits were related to debugging or minor formatting changes rather than functional updates.


## 1:33:03 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `Signup.jsx` between 12:34 AM and 1:19 AM on August 4th, 2025.  The file is a React component handling user signup, incorporating features like early access token handling, OTP verification, and client-side input validation.  There are no apparent changes in the file's overall structure or functionality across all revisions; instead, the modifications seem focused on refining the existing code.

The `user.service.js` file, modified once at 12:44 AM, appears to be a service for making API calls, handling authentication using access tokens retrieved from `token.service`.  It provides methods for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

The `Signup.jsx` file consistently utilizes numerous React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`) and Next.js navigation hooks (`useSearchParams`, `useRouter`).  It interacts with a `userService` for API calls related to user information and early access, referencing constants like `EARLY_ACCESS_INFO` and `USERINFO`.  The code manages user input for various fields (organization name, email, phone number, password, OTP), performs validation, and handles the signup process.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative improvements and bug fixes throughout the development process.  The majority of edits focus on the input validation and error handling within the `handleSignup` function.


## 4:56:46 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\BeforeLogin\Auth\Signup.jsx` between 1:38 AM and 1:50 AM on August 4th, 2025.  The file is a React component for user signup, handling both regular signup and early access signup via a token.  The code remains largely unchanged across all revisions; the differences are likely minor formatting adjustments or very subtle code changes not easily discernible from the provided commented-out code snippets.  The component uses various React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`), Next.js navigation (`useRouter`, `useSearchParams`), and a custom `userService` for API interactions.  Key features include:

* **Early Access Handling:** The component checks for an `id` token in the URL search parameters. If present, it fetches early access information using the `fetchEarlyAccessInfo` function and populates the `accountDetail` state accordingly.

* **OTP Input:** It includes an OTP input mechanism with automatic field focus and paste handling.

* **Input Validation:**  The `handleSignup` function performs extensive validation on user inputs (organization name, name, email, phone number, and password), showing notifications for errors.  A regular expression ensures password strength.

* **Data Storage:** The component removes any existing "user" and "userInfo" data from `localStorage` on mount.


There is no significant structural change to the code across these revisions. The timestamps suggest a period of active development and testing, with frequent saves or commits.


## 4:56:53 AM
The `SignUp.jsx` component, last modified on 8/4/2025, 1:32:32 AM, handles user sign-up functionality.  It features extensive input validation for organization name, user name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password (requiring at least 8 characters, an uppercase letter, a number, and a special character).  The password must also match a confirmation password.  The code uses a state management system to track input values, error messages, loading status, and OTP verification.  An OTP (One-Time Password) system is integrated, handling input via four separate input fields.  Error messages are displayed conditionally based on validation results.  The component interacts with backend services (`userService`) to create a user account (`FREESIGNUP` endpoint) and retrieve user information (`USERINFO` endpoint).  Local storage is used (though subsequently cleared on mount) likely for temporary user information storage.  The code includes functions for handling paste events and email domain validation, using a predefined list of public email domains.  The `useMetadata` hook suggests integration for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).


## 10:01:35 AM
The log shows two entries for `SignUp.jsx`, both at 8/4/2025, with a four-minute difference.  The code is identical in both entries, representing a React component for user signup.  The component handles user input validation, including checks for email format (rejecting public email domains), password complexity, and OTP verification.  It uses a `userService` for API calls (`FREESIGNUP` and `USERINFO` endpoints) and local storage to manage user information.  There are no actual code changes between the two timestamps; the log likely reflects a version control system's recording of the same code twice, perhaps due to a failed commit or similar operation.


## 10:01:36 AM
The `Signup.jsx` component underwent significant changes on August 4th, 2025, at 9:12:35 AM.  The code implements a user signup form with features for both early access users (via a token) and standard users.  The component manages user input for organization name, email, phone number, name, password, and a 4-digit OTP.  Extensive validation is performed on these fields, checking for minimum lengths, password complexity, and whether the email is a public domain email (only allowed for early access users).  Early access information is fetched using a token from the URL parameters via a call to `userService.get()`. If successful, the component populates the form with the received data.  Upon successful signup (handled in the `handleSignup` function), it redirects to '/summary'.  The component uses React's useState hook extensively for managing the form's state, including loading indicators and error messages, uses several useEffect hooks for managing side effects like cleanup, form input focus, and OTP handling and local storage cleanup. A countdown timer is implemented to display remaining time for OTP verification, however the functionality appears to be incomplete or commented out. The component also incorporates error handling and user feedback through notification alerts.  The code uses several external services/libraries, including `userService`, `useNotification`, `useRouter`, and `useSearchParams`.  The local storage is used to store user information temporarily which is cleaned up on component mount.


## 11:01:35 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `SignUp.jsx` component, all on August 4th, 2025.  The code consistently implements a user signup form with features like OTP verification and validation checks for various fields (organization name, email, phone number, password).

The revisions appear to focus on refinements and error handling rather than major structural changes.  All three timestamps reflect the same file contents; there are no discernible changes in the code across the three versions logged. The timestamps (10:01:40 AM, 10:04:05 AM, and 10:50:09 AM) likely represent  multiple saves or commits of the same code within the IDE or version control system without actual changes to the file's content.  The component uses React hooks for state management and makes API calls to a `userService` for signup and user information retrieval.  Input validation is extensive, checking for minimum lengths, password complexity, and disallowing public email domains.  Error messages are dynamically displayed based on validation results.


## 11:01:37 AM
The `Signup.jsx` component, last updated on 8/4/2025 at 10:13:15 AM, handles user signup functionality.  It uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) and Next.js navigation (`useRouter`, `useSearchParams`). The code manages user input for organization name, email, phone number, name, password, and a 4-digit OTP.  It performs client-side validation, checking for minimum lengths and password complexity.  A key feature is handling early access signup via a token obtained from URL parameters (`searchParams.get('id')`).  Early access information is fetched using `userService.get(`${EARLY_ACCESS_INFO}?token=${accessToken}`)`, populating the form fields. The component also includes a countdown timer for OTP entry,  and removes locally stored user data on mount. After successful validation, it makes a signup request (the full payload is not shown, but the fields are indicated). The code extensively uses state variables to manage various aspects of the form, including loading states, error handling (using `useNotification`), and input field focus management.  Error notifications are displayed using a custom hook.  The signup process seems to involve backend interaction via the `userService`.  The code incorporates several helper functions such as `isPublicEmail` for email validation and `countdownTimer` for managing the OTP timer.  The `handleSignup` function orchestrates the validation and API call.


## 11:02:17 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `SOCIAL.html` between 10:11 AM and 10:36 AM on August 4th, 2025.  The core content remained consistent—an email announcing the launch of Socion, a platform for influencer marketing, and highlighting its key features.  The changes primarily focused on styling and layout adjustments.

Specifically:

* **10:11 AM:** The initial version of the HTML was created, using inline styles extensively for layout and visual elements.

* **10:18 AM:**  Google Fonts ("Inter" and "Source Sans 3") were integrated, and inline styles were used to apply these fonts to the body of the email.

* **10:28 AM - 10:33 AM:** The `@import` statement for Google Fonts was replaced with a `<link>` tag for better semantics. Several minor adjustments to the styling followed during this period (e.g., adding box-shadow, adjusting padding, and adding a border to the table).  These changes primarily involved refinements to the visual appearance of the email, particularly the table containing the features of Socion.  Padding adjustments are observed in the Left Column of the table.


* **10:33 AM - 10:36 AM:** Further refinements to the padding within the left column of a table were made in several commits, suggesting iterative adjustments to spacing.


* **10:35 AM - 10:36 AM:**  The "Powered by Skribe" section, initially commented out, was uncommented and restyled, changing font color and size, indicating a final decision to include the attribution. The color was changed from `#64748b` to `#444444` and the font size was increased from `13px` to `16px`.  The strong tag color also changed from `#1e40af` to just black.


Throughout the changes, the underlying structure of the HTML using nested tables remained unchanged, demonstrating a commitment to a table-based email layout.  The relatively rapid series of edits after the inclusion of Google Fonts indicates a period of iterative design refinement.


## 12:01:43 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `SignUp.jsx`  between 11:07 AM and 11:53 AM on August 4th, 2025.  These updates appear to be incremental changes, possibly related to bug fixes or minor feature adjustments, as the core functionality remains consistent throughout.  The code within `SignUp.jsx`  is a React component handling user signup, including validation for organization name, name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password. It uses a custom OTP input system and interacts with backend services (`userService`) for user information retrieval and signup (`FREESIGNUP`, `USERINFO` constants).  There are also several commented-out sections of code.

Between 11:55 AM and 11:59 AM, changes were made to `layout.jsx`.  Initially, Google Analytics and Clarity tracking scripts were commented out.  Later, `ErrorAlerts` was added to the component tree.


Finally, at 12:00 PM, `ErrorAlerts.jsx` received an update, likely improving its functionality or styling. The `ErrorAlerts` component renders a notification based on the type ("error", "warning", "success") and includes material icons for visual cues.  It fades out automatically after 3 seconds.  The addition of `"use client";` to `ErrorAlerts.jsx` suggests a change to support React Server Components.


## 1:01:37 PM
The log shows three consecutive updates to `SignUp.jsx` on August 4th, 2025.  The code in all three entries is identical, suggesting that the timestamps represent failed attempts to save the changes, or that the changes were reverted after each commit.  The file contains React code for a user sign-up form.  Key features include:

* **Client-side rendering:** Indicated by the commented-out `"use client";` line.
* **User input validation:** Extensive checks are in place to ensure valid organization name, name, email (rejecting public email domains), phone number, and password formats.  Password complexity requirements are explicitly defined.
* **OTP (One-Time Password) implementation:**  The code manages an OTP input field with automatic focus shifting between fields, handling paste events, and assembling the full OTP from individual inputs.
* **API calls:** Uses `userService` to make requests to `/userinfo` and `FREESIGNUP` endpoints for user information retrieval and account creation respectively.
* **Error handling:** Uses state variables (`visible`, `message`) to display error messages to the user after failed validation or API calls.  It clears local storage items ("user" and "userInfo").


The lack of changes between the three log entries suggests a problem with the saving or version control process rather than significant code evolution.  The timestamp sequence indicates the attempts were clustered within a short timeframe (around 6 minutes).
