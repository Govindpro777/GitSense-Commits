# Activity Summary for 8/22/2025

## 10:11:57 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `socion1.html` and `socion2.html` between 12:35 AM and 10:07 AM on August 22, 2025.  The edits primarily focus on styling and layout adjustments within the HTML structure, which uses extensive nested tables for layout.  There is no consistent pattern in the very early edits to `socion1.html` (between 12:35 AM and 12:42 AM), but these mostly involve changes to font sizes, padding, and the removal of a large section of commented-out code.

Significant changes in `socion1.html` occur around 7:58 AM and 8:09 AM,  introducing increased padding values, larger font sizes, and changes to color values and font weights within the main content area and feature blocks. Changes after 8:09 AM are  primarily refinements to padding and minor font size adjustments. The text content remains largely unchanged.

The `socion2.html` file was created later and shows edits primarily focusing on layout, color scheme, and the introduction of text content explaining campaign success tracking. The initial background color was changed from `#F5F1E8` to `#FBF0D9`, and then to `#F5F5F5` in later edits. A dedicated section ("Here’s what you’ll see in your results dashboard:") was added and styled with a light yellow-cream background and specific font attributes.  The illustration image size was adjusted in a few edits, moving around 8 AM.  Further edits refined padding and made styling changes to the sections showing features of the campaign results dashboard, improving the overall presentation. The final changes include a background color change for the footer from white to `#FBF0D9` to match the rest of the email.  The overall flow of edits suggest an iterative design process focused on visual improvements and improved information organization.

**Recurring Elements:**

The emails heavily use tables for layout, consistent styling with Google Fonts, and similar calls to action.  There's also consistent use of images from `ucarecdn.com` and `beta-app.goskribe.com`, although the specific images change during the editing process, suggesting an iterative design process.  The color palette (#E86D70, #FBF0D9, #F5F5F5, #FFF5E8 etc.) remains relatively consistent. The progress bar’s percentage increases in `socion2.html`. The progress bar’s percentage is consistent in `socion1.html`.


The changes primarily involve refining the design, copy, and image selection within the existing email templates.  The bulk of the changes happen within a short window (around 11:30-11:37 AM), showing focused work on the layout and style. The later changes (after 12:04 PM) show significant content changes, especially in `socion3.html`, shifting the focus from campaign results to outreach features.
