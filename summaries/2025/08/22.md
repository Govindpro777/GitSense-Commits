# Activity Summary for 8/22/2025

## 10:11:57 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `socion1.html` and `socion2.html` between 12:35 AM and 10:07 AM on August 22, 2025.  The edits primarily focus on styling and layout adjustments within the HTML structure, which uses extensive nested tables for layout.  There is no consistent pattern in the very early edits to `socion1.html` (between 12:35 AM and 12:42 AM), but these mostly involve changes to font sizes, padding, and the removal of a large section of commented-out code.

Significant changes in `socion1.html` occur around 7:58 AM and 8:09 AM,  introducing increased padding values, larger font sizes, and changes to color values and font weights within the main content area and feature blocks. Changes after 8:09 AM are  primarily refinements to padding and minor font size adjustments. The text content remains largely unchanged.

The `socion2.html` file was created later and shows edits primarily focusing on layout, color scheme, and the introduction of text content explaining campaign success tracking. The initial background color was changed from `#F5F1E8` to `#FBF0D9`, and then to `#F5F5F5` in later edits. A dedicated section ("Here’s what you’ll see in your results dashboard:") was added and styled with a light yellow-cream background and specific font attributes.  The illustration image size was adjusted in a few edits, moving around 8 AM.  Further edits refined padding and made styling changes to the sections showing features of the campaign results dashboard, improving the overall presentation. The final changes include a background color change for the footer from white to `#FBF0D9` to match the rest of the email.  The overall flow of edits suggest an iterative design process focused on visual improvements and improved information organization.

**Recurring Elements:**

The emails heavily use tables for layout, consistent styling with Google Fonts, and similar calls to action.  There's also consistent use of images from `ucarecdn.com` and `beta-app.goskribe.com`, although the specific images change during the editing process, suggesting an iterative design process.  The color palette (#E86D70, #FBF0D9, #F5F5F5, #FFF5E8 etc.) remains relatively consistent. The progress bar’s percentage increases in `socion2.html`. The progress bar’s percentage is consistent in `socion1.html`.


The changes primarily involve refining the design, copy, and image selection within the existing email templates.  The bulk of the changes happen within a short window (around 11:30-11:37 AM), showing focused work on the layout and style. The later changes (after 12:04 PM) show significant content changes, especially in `socion3.html`, shifting the focus from campaign results to outreach features.


## 1:11:53 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to HTML files (`socion1.html`, `socion2.html`, `socion3.html`, `socion5.html`, `socion6.html`) between 12:15 PM and 1:11 PM on August 22, 2025.  The main focus is `socion4.html`, which undergoes numerous revisions.  All files are HTML emails with a consistent structure using tables for layout and incorporating  images from `ucarecdn.com` and `beta-app.goskribe.com`.  The footer consistently includes social media links and a "Powered by skribe" attribution.

`socion1.html` (12:28:03 PM): This email is a welcome email for a Socion account setup. It shows a progress bar at 30% and details the next steps to complete account setup, including finding influencers and setting up the first campaign.

`socion2.html` (12:27:57 PM): This email congratulates the user on launching their first Socion campaign and describes what is viewable in the results dashboard.

`socion3.html` (12:16:09 PM and 12:27:50 PM):  The first entry shows a progress bar at 60%  The second update shows the progress bar at 60% and features a similar call-to-action for outreach as `socion4.html` showing  consistent content and design across multiple email variations.

`socion4.html` (multiple timestamps): This file is heavily revised.  Early versions (12:15:42 PM, 12:16:57 PM, 12:17:13 PM) show a progress bar updating from 50% to 60%, and the main text changing from "You've discovered influencers. Now try outreach." to "You're halfway through your Socion trial."  The messaging is iteratively refined to emphasize the trial's end and encourage usage of Socion's features. Later versions (1:09:37 PM, 1:10:11 PM, 1:10:33 PM, 1:11:22 PM and 1:11:33 PM) shift to present a weekly summary, highlighting the number of influencers discovered, campaigns launched, and shortlists created. The call to action in these versions encourages feedback.

`socion5.html` (multiple timestamps): This file focuses on trial expiration, urging users to upgrade with a 15% discount before their trial ends.  It maintains the progress bar at 60% and consistently displays the three features (advanced filters, running another campaign, and testing outreach) to encourage further usage. The call-to-action changes from "Share Feedback in 2 Minutes" to "Upgrade Now & Save 15%".

`socion6.html` (1:07:13 PM): This file is similar to the final versions of `socion5.html`, emphasizing the trial's end and offering a 15% discount upon upgrade.

The overall pattern is iterative refinement of email copy, progress bar updates (though not consistently in sequential order), and a shift from introductory/tutorial emails to trial-ending upgrade promotion and finally weekly summary emails.  The consistent use of HTML tables and similar imagery suggests a unified email template.


## 2:11:51 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of HTML email templates (`socion1.html` through `socion7.html`), primarily focusing on the design and content related to Socion, a platform seemingly for influencer marketing.  The initial versions (`socion1.html`, first entry),  created around 1:13 PM, present onboarding emails showing a user's progress through account setup.  Later versions switch to different email messages, often promoting the platform's features or pushing trial upgrades.

`socion1.html` underwent several revisions between 1:13 PM and 1:53 PM, with significant changes to the background image URL (from `ucarecdn.com` to `beta-app.goskribe.com`) and minor adjustments to the introductory image. An additional change at 1:53 PM involves modifying the icon image in the "Find Influencers" section. A final revision at 1:53 PM replaced another icon in the same section.


The other files (`socion2.html` to `socion7.html`) primarily illustrate different stages of the user journey and marketing messages. `socion2.html` and `socion3.html` focus on successful campaign launches,  `socion4.html` shows a weekly summary, and `socion5.html` focuses on the user being halfway through their trial.  `socion6.html` and `socion7.html` are trial-ending emails encouraging upgrades, with `socion7.html` eventually changing to a post-trial message offering a discount to reactivate. The final changes to `socion7.html` (around 2:04 PM) adjusted the height of the illustration image and clarified the language in the body regarding trial expiry.

A consistent pattern across all files is the use of tables for layout, extensive inline CSS styling, and consistent branding elements (logos, social media links, and "Powered by skribe").  The progress bar within the header also consistently appears, though its percentage changes depending on the email's purpose.


## 3:11:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files, `socion6.html` and `socion1.html`,  between 2:20 PM and 3:08 PM on August 22, 2025.  Both files are email templates, likely for marketing purposes.

`socion6.html` (first and only revision): This file is an email template announcing a Socion trial nearing its end, urging the recipient to upgrade for continued access.  It includes a progress bar showing 60% completion and a prominent call to action to "Upgrade Now & Save 15%".  The email features a visually appealing design using images and color-coding, along with social media links and a "Powered by skribe" footer.


`socion1.html` (multiple revisions): This file is an email template targeting users who haven't completed their Socion account setup.  The email showcases the platform's features (finding influencers, setting up campaigns) and includes a progress bar initially showing 30% completion.  Significant changes in this file include:

* **2:26:04 PM:** Initial version with a progress bar and content describing account setup steps.  The progress bar was initially embedded within nested tables.
* **2:27:28 PM - 2:29:52 PM:**  Several minor edits primarily focused on restructuring the progress bar HTML to improve clarity and formatting. The nested tables containing the progress bar were gradually simplified and reorganized. The commented-out sections were removed during this process.
* **2:29:07 PM:**  The padding of the main heading was adjusted. The image height was also slightly altered.
* **2:29:52 PM:** The image height was further adjusted in the content row.
* **2:35:37 PM - 2:39:10 PM:** The major structural change involved switching from a two-column table layout in the header to a two-column layout using `table-layout: fixed;` for better control over column widths.  The commented-out sections showing previous implementations of the header were removed.  The progress bar styling and placement were refined across these revisions.
* **2:38:57 PM:**  The progress bar's background color was changed from #FEA854 to #EBD4E3, while the filled portion changed to #FEA854. The main goal was to visually make the progress bar more intuitive.


A recurring element in both email templates is the use of nested tables for layout, images for visual appeal, and consistent branding elements such as logos and social media links.  The frequent revisions to `socion1.html` suggest iterative improvements to the email's design and structure, likely aimed at optimizing user experience and visual appeal.


## 4:11:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files: `socion7.html` and `WEEKLY_5.html`.  The changes span a short period, between approximately 3:13 PM and 4:04 PM on August 22, 2025.

**`socion7.html` Updates:**

This file tracks changes to an email template.  The initial version (3:13:13 PM) is a relatively complete email, focused on a Socion trial ending and encouraging reactivation with a 15% discount. Subsequent revisions (3:13:34 PM and 3:13:51 PM) refine the wording of the email, improving the call to action and overall messaging.  The final versions (3:26:34 PM onwards) change the subject line to request user feedback.


**`WEEKLY_5.html` Updates:**

This file shows edits to a weekly newsletter template.  The initial version (3:15:42 PM) is again quite complete but undergoes several modifications.  The most significant changes involve the first blog post title (changing from "Track These 7 PR KPIs to Show Real Impact" to "7 Effective AI Prompts for PR Pros: Transform Your Communications Strategy" at 3:16:04 PM and later modifying the text content of the same block) and a minor adjustment of the second blog post title. Additional content is added at the end (3:16:49 PM), including a call to action to sign in to the Skribe dashboard.  These revisions, occurring between 3:16 PM and 3:26 PM, focus on improving the newsletter’s content and presentation.  Further minor edits occur until 4:04 PM focusing on formatting and styling, particularly in positioning elements.  The iterative changes suggest a process of refining content and layout for optimal visual appeal and engagement.

**Recurring Elements:**

Both files consistently use HTML table structures for layout, indicating a reliance on table-based email design.  Both utilize external links to Google Fonts and images hosted on `ucarecdn.com` and `beta-app.goskribe.com`. The `goskribe` domain appears prominently, suggesting a connection to the Skribe platform.  There's a consistent use of inline CSS styling.


## 5:12:06 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of HTML email templates (socion1.html, socion2.html, socion3.html, socion4.html, socion5.html, socion6.html, socion7.html, socion8.html) between 4:14 PM and 5:03 PM on August 22, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the text content and, to a lesser extent, the styling and image URLs.  The `socion2.html` file underwent the most revisions.

**File-Specific Updates:**

* **socion1.html:** This file is a welcome email for new users, guiding them through account setup. It contains a progress bar (initially 30%, later remaining at 30%).  The major change is a simplification of the layout and removing redundant tables.  The final revision at 5:03 PM shows a minimum width adjustment for better responsiveness.

* **socion2.html:** This file is a success email for users who launched their first campaign. The updates focus on refining the styling and layout consistency.  There are several adjustments to the table widths and padding throughout the email.  The progress bar shows 50% completion.

* **socion3.html, socion4.html, socion5.html, socion6.html, socion7.html, socion8.html:** These files represent different stages of user interaction with the Socion platform, ranging from initial campaign launch to trial ending and feedback requests.  `socion3.html` shows a progress bar at 60% and focuses on encouraging outreach. `socion4.html` shows a weekly summary. `socion5.html` is a mid-trial reminder. `socion6.html` and `socion7.html` are trial-ending emails with upgrade offers. Finally, `socion8.html` is a post-trial feedback request.  The most notable change across these files involves the image URLs shifting from `beta-app.goskribe.com` to `ucarecdn.com` for some images  around 4:16 PM.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

* **4:16 PM:** A significant change occurred with the image URLs changing for several files.
* **4:45 PM and onward:** Multiple revisions to `socion1.html` and `socion2.html`  show iterative refinements to layout and styling, particularly focusing on table widths and padding.


**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

* **Consistent Structure:** All files follow a similar HTML table-based structure for layout.
* **Progress Bar:** A progress bar is consistently present in most emails, indicating different stages of user progress.
* **Image URLs:** Most files use images from `beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/` and  `ucarecdn.com`.
* **Branding:** Consistent branding elements such as the Socion logo and social media links are maintained.
* **Call to Action:**  Each email includes a clear call to action (CTA) button, appropriate to its content (e.g., "Try Outreach Today," "Upgrade Now").

In summary, the code changes reflect a process of iterative improvement and content creation for a series of automated emails related to the Socion platform, specifically focusing on user onboarding, campaign progress tracking, and trial management.  The image URL shift suggests a potential CDN migration for image hosting.
