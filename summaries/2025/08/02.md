## 12:39:04 AM
The log shows a single file, `Leads.jsx`, undergoing multiple revisions between August 1st and 2nd, 2025.  All revisions after the initial commit at 11:44:29 PM on August 1st, 2025, resulted in the entire component being commented out. This suggests a potential temporary disabling or removal of the component's functionality, possibly for debugging, refactoring, or as part of a larger feature development process.  The final state of the file, as of 12:30:34 AM on August 2nd, 2025, shows the entire `Leads.jsx` component code commented out.  There is a pattern of repetitive commenting out of the entire code block across multiple commits.


## 10:40:22 AM
The `Signup.jsx` component, last modified on August 2nd, 2025, at 9:59:32 AM, handles user signup.  The code implements a form with fields for organization name, email, phone number, name, password, and a 4-digit OTP.  Early access users have their information pre-filled via a token passed in URL parameters.

Significant updates include extensive input validation (organization name, name, email, phone number, and password length and format), OTP handling with auto-focus and paste functionality, and conditional logic based on early access status. The code fetches early access user information using a provided token and makes API calls to a `userService`.  Error handling and notifications are implemented using a `useNotification` hook.  Local storage is used briefly to store and immediately remove user information.  The component also includes a countdown timer for OTP entry.  The user is redirected to a '/summary' page after successful signup or error.  Public email domain validation prevents the use of personal email addresses unless the user has early access.
