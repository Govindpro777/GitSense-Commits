# Activity Summary for 8/2/2025

## 12:39:04 AM
The log shows a single file, `Leads.jsx`, undergoing multiple revisions between August 1st and 2nd, 2025.  All revisions after the initial commit at 11:44:29 PM on August 1st, 2025, resulted in the entire component being commented out. This suggests a potential temporary disabling or removal of the component's functionality, possibly for debugging, refactoring, or as part of a larger feature development process.  The final state of the file, as of 12:30:34 AM on August 2nd, 2025, shows the entire `Leads.jsx` component code commented out.  There is a pattern of repetitive commenting out of the entire code block across multiple commits.


## 10:40:22 AM
The `Signup.jsx` component, last modified on August 2nd, 2025, at 9:59:32 AM, handles user signup.  The code implements a form with fields for organization name, email, phone number, name, password, and a 4-digit OTP.  Early access users have their information pre-filled via a token passed in URL parameters.

Significant updates include extensive input validation (organization name, name, email, phone number, and password length and format), OTP handling with auto-focus and paste functionality, and conditional logic based on early access status. The code fetches early access user information using a provided token and makes API calls to a `userService`.  Error handling and notifications are implemented using a `useNotification` hook.  Local storage is used briefly to store and immediately remove user information.  The component also includes a countdown timer for OTP entry.  The user is redirected to a '/summary' page after successful signup or error.  Public email domain validation prevents the use of personal email addresses unless the user has early access.


## 10:40:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Leads.jsx` file between 12:45 AM and 12:59 AM on August 2nd, 2025.  The code appears to be a React component for managing leads, incorporating features like fetching leads from an API (`/api/v1/lead/get-all`), creating new leads (`/api/v1/lead/create`), and displaying lead statistics (total leads, active leads, leads this month).  The component uses `lucide-react` for icons and handles form input changes, including file uploads for documents.  No substantive changes to the code's functionality are evident across the numerous revisions; the timestamps suggest iterative edits or minor adjustments rather than significant feature additions or bug fixes.  Authentication appears to be handled using a token retrieved from local storage.  The base URL for API calls defaults to `http://localhost:3000/`.


## 12:40:22 PM
This commit significantly modifies the `Signup.jsx` component, focusing on user registration functionality.  The code implements a signup form with fields for organization name, email, phone number, name, password, and a 4-digit OTP.  The component uses several React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useRouter`, `useSearchParams`), and interacts with a `userService` for API calls.  Significant validation is implemented, checking for minimum lengths of input fields, password complexity, and whether a company (non-public) email is used unless early access is granted.

The component handles early access signup via a token passed in URL search parameters. If a token exists, it fetches user information from a backend service (`fetchEarlyAccessInfo`) and pre-populates the form.  There is also handling for a countdown timer for OTP entry.  On successful signup the component redirects to '/summary'. The timestamp of this extensive change is 8/2/2025, 10:42:16 AM.  Local storage is cleared of 'user' and 'userInfo' on component mount. The code uses asynchronous operations for API calls and incorporates error handling and notification using a custom `useNotification` hook.  The OTP input is managed with refs to control focus.  The use of regular expressions for email and password validation is prominent.
