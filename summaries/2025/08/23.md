# Activity Summary for 8/23/2025

## 10:13:38 AM
The log shows multiple code changes across several files in a React project.  The most significant changes are in `NavigationContainer.jsx` and `CreateLeadModal.jsx`, with numerous minor modifications to `Leads.jsx` and commented-out code in `User.jsx`.

**`NavigationContainer.jsx`**: This file underwent a substantial revision.  The commented-out code represents the previous version, primarily a sidebar navigation component using Ant Design. The updated version added functionality to retrieve and use the user's role from localStorage, presumably to conditionally render menu items based on user permissions.  This change likely occurred around 12:19:52 AM on August 23, 2025. The updated code now includes conditional rendering of menu items based on user role.


**`CreateLeadModal.jsx`**: This component, a modal for creating new leads, had its code completely replaced multiple times between 12:21:38 AM and 12:34:53 AM on August 23, 2025. The initial version had a complete implementation. The subsequent changes resulted in the code being completely commented out, suggesting a potential temporary removal or refactoring.  The final version included a form to create leads and made API calls (to `/api/v1/lead/create` and `/api/v1/user/get-All`) with authentication headers to create and fetch user data.


**`Leads.jsx`**:  This file, a component for displaying and managing leads, shows many minor updates between 9:22:41 AM and 9:56:07 AM on August 23, 2025. These changes involved incremental refinements, likely focusing on features like filtering, searching, and handling reminders.  The  `fetchLeads` function was updated to filter leads based on `assignedTo`,  `isActive` status, search term, status filter, and source filter.  Further enhancements involved adding the ability to view all reminders and fetch them by lead ID.



**`User.jsx`**: This file contains only commented-out code across several timestamps (between 9:31:55 AM and 9:55:21 AM on August 23, 2025), indicating a component for user management was temporarily removed or heavily refactored. This component seems to have included features for creating users, fetching users (using endpoints `/api/v1/user/get-All` and `/api/v1/user/get-active-users`), and toggling user status, similar to the lead management in `Leads.jsx`.


**Recurring elements**: Several files use the `VITE_FILE_BASE_URL` environment variable to construct API endpoints.  There's also consistent use of `localStorage.getItem('auth')` for retrieving authentication tokens, indicating a common authentication mechanism throughout the application.  The frequent use of `try...catch` blocks in `fetch` calls shows attention to error handling across API interactions.  Finally,  `statusOptions` and `sourceOptions` arrays appear in multiple files, suggesting shared data for lead status and sources.
