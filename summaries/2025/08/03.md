# Activity Summary for 8/3/2025

## 1:03:51 AM
The SOCIAL.html file was updated on August 2nd, 2025, at 2:29:05 PM.  The changes primarily involved modifying the newsletter's header image and layout.  The old header (`mailerHeader.png`) was replaced with `mailerHeader1.png`, resulting in adjustments to padding and image dimensions for the Skribe logo. The content itself remained largely consistent, focusing on Skribe's new features (press release distribution and regional vernacular tracking), a key event (IDMA awards), journalist of the month, key appointments and industry updates, and a call to action for paid press release distribution.  The update uses consistent styling throughout, leveraging specific fonts ('proxima-nova', 'Montserrat') and maintaining a clean, visually appealing layout optimized for email delivery.  The file utilizes a table-based structure for layout and includes numerous inline styles for precise control over visual elements.  A recurring element is the use of inline images for icons and logos, sourced from both `beta-app.goskribe.com` and `www.goskribe.com`.
