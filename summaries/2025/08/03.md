# Activity Summary for 8/3/2025

## 1:03:51 AM
The SOCIAL.html file was updated on August 2nd, 2025, at 2:29:05 PM.  The changes primarily involved modifying the newsletter's header image and layout.  The old header (`mailerHeader.png`) was replaced with `mailerHeader1.png`, resulting in adjustments to padding and image dimensions for the Skribe logo. The content itself remained largely consistent, focusing on Skribe's new features (press release distribution and regional vernacular tracking), a key event (IDMA awards), journalist of the month, key appointments and industry updates, and a call to action for paid press release distribution.  The update uses consistent styling throughout, leveraging specific fonts ('proxima-nova', 'Montserrat') and maintaining a clean, visually appealing layout optimized for email delivery.  The file utilizes a table-based structure for layout and includes numerous inline styles for precise control over visual elements.  A recurring element is the use of inline images for icons and logos, sourced from both `beta-app.goskribe.com` and `www.goskribe.com`.

The log shows two revisions of `Signup.jsx` on August 3rd, 2025.  Both revisions contain a large, commented-out React component responsible for user signup.  The code implements features like:

* **OTP verification:**  The component manages an OTP input field, using refs for auto-focusing and handling paste events.  A countdown timer is included (though commented out).

* **Early access handling:** It fetches early access information based on a token from URL parameters.

* **User information storage:**  It interacts with local storage to handle user data (though this interaction is now removed).

* **Input validation:**  Signup requires a minimum 3-character organization name and name, a valid email address (disallowing public email providers unless early access is used), a 10-digit phone number, and a strong password (at least 8 characters with uppercase, number, and special character).

* **API calls:**  The component interacts with a `userService` to handle early access information retrieval and likely user signup itself (the actual API call is incomplete in the commented out code).

The timestamps indicate two commits within approximately 11 minutes of each other.  The content of the two commits is identical. This suggests that the second commit might be a redundant or accidental duplicate, or perhaps a staged change that was later reverted, or a backup of the code.  There are no substantive code changes between the two timestamps.
