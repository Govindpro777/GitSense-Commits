# Activity Summary for 8/13/2025

## 12:24:52 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CreateLeadModal.jsx` between August 12th and 13th, 2025.  The file is a React component for creating new leads.  Initially (August 12th, 11:57 PM), the component was largely commented out.  Subsequent commits (August 13th, between 12:01 AM and 12:16 AM) progressively uncommented and added to the component.  A significant change occurred around 12:01 AM, where the component became functional.  This version includes form fields for name, email, contact number, source, status, remark, notes, industry, and address (with detail, pin code, city, and country). It also handles form submission, error display, and input changes.  The `source` and `status` fields use dropdown menus populated with predefined options.  The code fetches data using `fetch` with authentication (`Bearer` token from `localStorage`).  Further commits after 12:01 AM seem to have reverted the code back to a commented-out state, suggesting potential experimentation or temporary removal of the component.  The recurring pattern involves commenting and uncommenting the entire component's code across multiple revisions.


## 10:21:10 AM
The log shows modifications to `SignupStep.jsx` on August 13th, 2025.  The file is a React component for a signup form.  The primary changes involve the UI and the handling of form submission.

The first two entries (9:21:43 AM and 9:22:10 AM) appear to be nearly identical, suggesting a possible accidental duplicate or a very minor, insignificant change that's not discernible from the provided code snippets.

The third entry (9:28:35 AM) shows a small deletion in the UI code. Specifically, a `<select>` element for selecting the "Organization Type" has been commented out (`{/* ... */}`).  There are no other functional changes apparent in the provided code snippets.  The core functionality of form validation, data submission using `userService.post(BEFORE_SIGNUP, submitData)`, and error handling remains consistent across all entries. The form collects user information including name, work email, designation, company, influencer marketing engagement details, tools used, agency involvement, pain points, and company type.  Validation checks are in place to ensure all required fields are filled before submission.  The `isPublicEmail` function validates that the provided email address is not from a public domain.
