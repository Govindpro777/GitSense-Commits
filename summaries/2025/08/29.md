# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 10:02:12 AM
The primary change on August 29th, 2025, at 9:28:20 AM, involved updating `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts`. This file contains an Axios instance configured for API interaction.  The update focuses heavily on refining the error handling and token refresh mechanism.

Specifically, the code now includes improved handling of network errors, displaying a toast message instead of an alert.  The most significant addition is a robust implementation of access token refresh upon receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response. This involves checking for an existing refresh attempt (`isRefreshing`), making a refresh token request to `/Authenticate/refresh-token`, updating local tokens upon success, and retrying the original request.  If refresh fails, the user is redirected to the login page (`/`).  Multiple base URLs are commented out, suggesting recent changes in deployment environment.  The `X-Source-App` header is set to `BackendApp`.  The code utilizes `Alert` components (presumably for UI feedback) and `TokenService` for managing access and refresh tokens.
