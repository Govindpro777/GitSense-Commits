# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 10:02:12 AM
The primary change on August 29th, 2025, at 9:28:20 AM, involved updating `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Backend\Skribe-Backend\src\services\api.ts`. This file contains an Axios instance configured for API interaction.  The update focuses heavily on refining the error handling and token refresh mechanism.

Specifically, the code now includes improved handling of network errors, displaying a toast message instead of an alert.  The most significant addition is a robust implementation of access token refresh upon receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response. This involves checking for an existing refresh attempt (`isRefreshing`), making a refresh token request to `/Authenticate/refresh-token`, updating local tokens upon success, and retrying the original request.  If refresh fails, the user is redirected to the login page (`/`).  Multiple base URLs are commented out, suggesting recent changes in deployment environment.  The `X-Source-App` header is set to `BackendApp`.  The code utilizes `Alert` components (presumably for UI feedback) and `TokenService` for managing access and refresh tokens.

The `Customers.jsx` file was updated on August 29, 2025, at 9:38:15 AM.  This component displays a list of customers, allowing for searching, adding, editing, and deleting entries.  The component fetches customer data via an API call to  `${BASE_URL}/api/v1/admin/getAllCustomers` using an authorization token stored in localStorage.  The API endpoints used include `/api/v1/admin/createCustomer`, `/api/v1/admin/updateCustomer/{customerId}`, and `/api/v1/admin/deleteCustomer/{customerId}` for CRUD operations.

The code implements client-side filtering based on search terms across various customer fields (name, email, phone, GST, PAN).  It uses React's useState hook extensively to manage component state, including customer data, modal visibility, form data, loading status, and the currently selected customer for editing. Error handling is included using `react-hot-toast` for displaying success and error messages to the user. The UI is built using a table structure with a search bar and buttons for adding new customers.  Modals are used for creating and editing customer information, with form validation ensuring required fields are filled.  The component leverages `lucide-react` for icons and `axios` for API interactions.
