# Activity Summary for 8/27/2025

## 12:00:25 PM
The log shows a series of changes to the `ClientsReports.tsx` file, spanning from 11:32 AM to 12:00 PM on August 27, 2025.  Initially, the file contained only commented-out code, suggesting a component under development.  Subsequent commits progressively added functionality.

The most significant change occurred between 11:33:14 AM and 11:33:26 AM, where the entire component was uncommented and made functional. This version included features for fetching articles based on date ranges and keywords, handling loading states, and displaying results.  The code uses `react-redux`, `axios`, and other libraries for state management, API calls, and UI components. The `getArticle` function makes a POST request to `/Reporting` endpoint of the `userService`, likely to retrieve data from a search index (Elasticsearch based on the structure of the request).  Error handling and loading indicators are also implemented.

Further commits between 11:33:26 AM and 11:58 AM added features to handle article selection, category selection through dropdowns, and generating reports.  These commits introduced  `handleCheckboxChange`, `handleDropdownChange`, and `generateReport` functions.  Additionally, functionality to add new articles was added via `handleArticleAdded`.  The code also includes calls to fetch brand and category data using `userService.get`.

The final commit at 11:58:39 AM and all the commits after  seem to revert the file back to only commented out code. This suggests either an issue with the implemented functionality, a rollback, or possibly a temporary state in the development process.


The `api.ts` file was modified once at 11:22:39 AM.  This file contains an Axios instance configured for making API requests. It includes an interceptor for handling token refresh to maintain session validity.   The base URL is dynamically determined and it also checks for Network error and  Session expiry, and redirects to login accordingly.
