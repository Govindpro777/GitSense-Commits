# Activity Summary for 8/27/2025

## 12:00:25 PM
The log shows a series of changes to the `ClientsReports.tsx` file, spanning from 11:32 AM to 12:00 PM on August 27, 2025.  Initially, the file contained only commented-out code, suggesting a component under development.  Subsequent commits progressively added functionality.

The most significant change occurred between 11:33:14 AM and 11:33:26 AM, where the entire component was uncommented and made functional. This version included features for fetching articles based on date ranges and keywords, handling loading states, and displaying results.  The code uses `react-redux`, `axios`, and other libraries for state management, API calls, and UI components. The `getArticle` function makes a POST request to `/Reporting` endpoint of the `userService`, likely to retrieve data from a search index (Elasticsearch based on the structure of the request).  Error handling and loading indicators are also implemented.

Further commits between 11:33:26 AM and 11:58 AM added features to handle article selection, category selection through dropdowns, and generating reports.  These commits introduced  `handleCheckboxChange`, `handleDropdownChange`, and `generateReport` functions.  Additionally, functionality to add new articles was added via `handleArticleAdded`.  The code also includes calls to fetch brand and category data using `userService.get`.

The final commit at 11:58:39 AM and all the commits after  seem to revert the file back to only commented out code. This suggests either an issue with the implemented functionality, a rollback, or possibly a temporary state in the development process.


The `api.ts` file was modified once at 11:22:39 AM.  This file contains an Axios instance configured for making API requests. It includes an interceptor for handling token refresh to maintain session validity.   The base URL is dynamically determined and it also checks for Network error and  Session expiry, and redirects to login accordingly.


## 1:00:27 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `ClientsReports.tsx` file between 12:05 PM and 12:49 PM on August 27, 2025.  The code within the file remains largely unchanged across all revisions; it's a React component that fetches and displays articles, allowing users to select articles for report generation.  The component uses various libraries including `react-redux`, `react-select`, `react-flatpickr`, and `react-sortablejs`.  The core functionality involves a `getArticle` function that makes a POST request to a `/Reporting` endpoint, likely an Elasticsearch or similar search engine, based on selected date range and keywords.  The response is parsed and displayed, with pagination handled by `size` and `from` state variables.  There's also functionality for selecting articles and assigning categories (`handleCheckboxChange`, `handleDropdownChange`).  The code consistently uses commented-out code sections, suggesting ongoing development and experimentation with different features.  No significant functional changes are observed across the multiple commits, only minor adjustments to the timestamps.


## 2:00:26 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ClientsReports.tsx`, a React component likely for displaying and managing client reports.  The core functionality involves fetching and displaying articles based on selected keywords, date ranges, and pagination.

The initial revisions (8/27/2025, 1:02:21 PM and 1:02:37 PM) contain largely identical commented-out code, representing an earlier version of the component.  This version used a direct POST request to a `/Reporting` endpoint with a complex JSON payload for data retrieval. The `_source` field in the request specified the desired fields from the Elasticsearch response.  The code also managed article selection, categorization via checkboxes and dropdown, and report generation.

A significant change occurs at 1:17:48 PM and 1:18:18 PM, with the code remaining largely the same; however, the final revision (8/27/2025, 1:21:19 PM) shows substantial restructuring and improvements.  The key changes are:

* **API Endpoint Change:** The `/Reporting` endpoint is replaced with `/SearchArticles`, suggesting a shift in backend API design. The request data structure is simplified to a more conventional object.
* **Pagination Implementation:**  The `from` and `size` variables used for pagination are replaced with `page` and `pageSize`, improving readability and standard practice. The `handleLoadMore` function now correctly increments the page number.
* **Error Handling:** More robust error handling is added to the API call, with specific error messages for various scenarios (invalid response, no records found).
* **Data Handling:** The response parsing is simplified, using the structure `response.data` to retrieve articles and `response.totalRecords` for pagination. Null checks are added to prevent errors from missing data fields.
* **Article Data Structure:** The `Article` interface is enhanced, including `intatcattrid` and adding default values for potentially missing fields in the API response.
* **Add Article Functionality:**  The component now includes functionality (`handleArticleAdded`) to add new articles, updating the `newsFeed` state accordingly.
* **Brand and Category Management:** New features are introduced for managing brands and categories.  `useEffect` hooks make API calls to fetch brands and their associated keywords and categories (`/Brands`, `/BrandKeyword`, `/Categories`).  The `onBrandChange` function updates the available keywords based on the selected brand.  A function to add new keywords (`addKeyword`) is included with a POST request to the `/Keyword/Add` endpoint.


In summary, the final revision represents a significant refactoring of the `ClientsReports.tsx` component, improving the code's structure, error handling, and data management.  The change also indicates a move towards a more modular and maintainable API interaction strategy. The addition of brand and category management suggests enhanced functionality in the application.
