# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 4:26:29 AM
The log shows code changes across three files within a timeframe of approximately 6 minutes on August 28, 2025.

The `db.js` file (12:46:28 AM) contains a configuration file for connecting to a MongoDB database.  It uses environment variables to specify the connection URL. The code uses `mongoose` to handle the database connection, and includes error handling for failed connections.

The `Services.tsx` file underwent two updates.  Both updates (12:52:32 AM and 12:58:28 AM)  show the code for a React component that manages a list of services.  The component includes functionality for:

*   Loading, displaying, and filtering services from an API (`/services`).
*   Creating, updating, and deleting services (CRUD operations).
*   Inline editing of service details.
*   Exporting services data as a CSV file.
*   Implementing user permissions (`useCan`) to control CRUD operations.
*   Client-side and server-side pagination.
*   Input validation (e.g., requiring a service name).

The code in `Services.tsx` remains largely unchanged between the two timestamps; there is no significant functional difference visible in the provided snippets.  The only observable difference is the lack of some closing tags in the second log entry.  This is likely a copy-paste error in the log itself, as the closing tags would be needed for functional code.

The `.env` file contains sensitive configuration information (database credentials, JWT secret) and is therefore excluded from this summary.


## 12:46:54 PM
The `ArticleIngestion.tsx` component was updated on August 28, 2025, at 11:48:03 AM.  This component handles CSV file uploads for article ingestion.  The key changes involve the addition of robust file handling (allowing only CSV files),  a mock data feature for testing purposes (`useMockData` state), and detailed visual feedback to the user, including loading indicators, success/error messages, and a summary of processed data presented in a table. The backend API endpoint used is `/csv-to-array/pandas`. The frontend displays total records, inserted records, filename, and a table showing the processed data (outlet, article URL, and brand).  The mock data includes sample article data from various news outlets and brands.  Error handling is implemented for file type validation and API request failures.  A reset button clears the form and uploaded file.


## 1:10:24 PM
The `graphics.controller.js` file underwent significant changes on August 28, 2025, at 12:47:19 PM.  The primary update centers around the `createOrder` function.  Initially, this function was fully implemented, handling order creation, file uploads (using `localFileUpload`), user assignment (finding an available "Graphics" user via `findAvailableGraphicsUser` or using a provided `assignedTo` value), work queue item creation (`WorkQueue`), and notification sending (`sendAssignmentNotification`).  It used transactions to ensure atomicity.

The revised `createOrder` function now includes robust input validation, checking for mandatory fields (`requirements`, `dimensions`, `files`). It also handles the scenario where a `customerId` is provided or not, creating a customer if necessary, and verifies the existence of the provided customerId.  The commented-out original `createOrder` function suggests a previous version that lacked this customer validation and more streamlined error handling.

Other notable additions include:

*   Helper functions: `calculatePriority`, `calculateEstimatedCompletion` for determining order priority and estimated completion time.
*   Improved notification handling in `sendAssignmentNotification`, using socket.io (`socketManager`) for real-time updates.  Error handling within the notification process is improved.
*   The `getSockets` function is updated to use the `socketManager`.
*   The code utilizes various Mongoose models (`Order`, `Cad`, `WorkQueue`, `User`, `Log`, `Customer`, `Address`, `notification`) and external libraries like `mongoose`, `path`, `fs`, `agenda`, `dotenv`, and `moment`.


The changes reflect a shift towards more robust error handling, improved input validation, and more efficient real-time communication using socket.io. The addition of customer handling makes the order creation more comprehensive.  The overall pattern is to improve the reliability and user experience of the order creation process.
