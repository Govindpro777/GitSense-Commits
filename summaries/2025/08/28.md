# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 4:26:29 AM
The log shows code changes across three files within a timeframe of approximately 6 minutes on August 28, 2025.

The `db.js` file (12:46:28 AM) contains a configuration file for connecting to a MongoDB database.  It uses environment variables to specify the connection URL. The code uses `mongoose` to handle the database connection, and includes error handling for failed connections.

The `Services.tsx` file underwent two updates.  Both updates (12:52:32 AM and 12:58:28 AM)  show the code for a React component that manages a list of services.  The component includes functionality for:

*   Loading, displaying, and filtering services from an API (`/services`).
*   Creating, updating, and deleting services (CRUD operations).
*   Inline editing of service details.
*   Exporting services data as a CSV file.
*   Implementing user permissions (`useCan`) to control CRUD operations.
*   Client-side and server-side pagination.
*   Input validation (e.g., requiring a service name).

The code in `Services.tsx` remains largely unchanged between the two timestamps; there is no significant functional difference visible in the provided snippets.  The only observable difference is the lack of some closing tags in the second log entry.  This is likely a copy-paste error in the log itself, as the closing tags would be needed for functional code.

The `.env` file contains sensitive configuration information (database credentials, JWT secret) and is therefore excluded from this summary.


## 12:46:54 PM
The `ArticleIngestion.tsx` component was updated on August 28, 2025, at 11:48:03 AM.  This component handles CSV file uploads for article ingestion.  The key changes involve the addition of robust file handling (allowing only CSV files),  a mock data feature for testing purposes (`useMockData` state), and detailed visual feedback to the user, including loading indicators, success/error messages, and a summary of processed data presented in a table. The backend API endpoint used is `/csv-to-array/pandas`. The frontend displays total records, inserted records, filename, and a table showing the processed data (outlet, article URL, and brand).  The mock data includes sample article data from various news outlets and brands.  Error handling is implemented for file type validation and API request failures.  A reset button clears the form and uploaded file.


## 1:10:24 PM
The `graphics.controller.js` file underwent significant changes on August 28, 2025, at 12:47:19 PM.  The primary update centers around the `createOrder` function.  Initially, this function was fully implemented, handling order creation, file uploads (using `localFileUpload`), user assignment (finding an available "Graphics" user via `findAvailableGraphicsUser` or using a provided `assignedTo` value), work queue item creation (`WorkQueue`), and notification sending (`sendAssignmentNotification`).  It used transactions to ensure atomicity.

The revised `createOrder` function now includes robust input validation, checking for mandatory fields (`requirements`, `dimensions`, `files`). It also handles the scenario where a `customerId` is provided or not, creating a customer if necessary, and verifies the existence of the provided customerId.  The commented-out original `createOrder` function suggests a previous version that lacked this customer validation and more streamlined error handling.

Other notable additions include:

*   Helper functions: `calculatePriority`, `calculateEstimatedCompletion` for determining order priority and estimated completion time.
*   Improved notification handling in `sendAssignmentNotification`, using socket.io (`socketManager`) for real-time updates.  Error handling within the notification process is improved.
*   The `getSockets` function is updated to use the `socketManager`.
*   The code utilizes various Mongoose models (`Order`, `Cad`, `WorkQueue`, `User`, `Log`, `Customer`, `Address`, `notification`) and external libraries like `mongoose`, `path`, `fs`, `agenda`, `dotenv`, and `moment`.


The changes reflect a shift towards more robust error handling, improved input validation, and more efficient real-time communication using socket.io. The addition of customer handling makes the order creation more comprehensive.  The overall pattern is to improve the reliability and user experience of the order creation process.


## 2:07:46 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `modifed_weeklyactivity.html` on August 28th, 2025.  The file is an HTML email template, likely for a weekly activity report.

The main changes throughout the revisions center around the weekly activity metrics displayed in a bulleted list.  Initially, placeholders (`[X]`, `[Y]`, `[Z]`) represented these metrics.  These were subsequently replaced with the specific values, or rather with the values of 0 for "Influencers Shortlisted", "Influencers Engaged" and "Campaign Sent", suggesting a data update process.  The label "Influencers discovered" was also changed to "Influencers Shortlisted". One notable change at 1:14:47 PM was updating "[First Name]" to "Bharat Kishnani", personalizing the email.

The overall structure of the HTML email (styling, images, and layout) remained consistent across all revisions. The time intervals between revisions are relatively short (minutes), indicating an iterative refinement or data population process.


## 5:46:57 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ArticleInjestion.tsx`, a React component responsible for CSV file uploading and processing.  The component interacts with a backend API at a specified URL, initially `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and later updated to  `http://143.110.187.230:8000`.  The component provides a UI for file selection, processing, and displaying results including a mock data option for testing.

The first few revisions (5:28 PM - 5:37 PM) focus on refining the file upload handling (`handleSubmit`) and error messages.  There's a clear effort to improve the handling of upload failures, including logging the error and providing more informative feedback to the user.  The crucial change in `handleSubmit` between 5:37 PM and 5:46 PM involves removing the Content-Type header from the fetch request, addressing a potential conflict. Notably, the file upload functionality remains consistent throughout, with only minor improvements to error handling and feedback mechanisms.

A separate file, `api.ts`, details the API interaction logic, including token authentication and refresh mechanisms using axios. This service handles potential 401 errors (Unauthorized) gracefully by attempting to refresh the access token. Network errors are also handled, presenting a user friendly alert.  This file was updated only once (at 5:29 PM).

Finally, the last revision (5:46 PM) completely removes all code from `ArticleInjestion.tsx`, suggesting a potential accidental deletion or a temporary removal of the component.
