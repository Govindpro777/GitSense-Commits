# Activity Summary for 8/12/2025

## 12:18:24 AM
The log shows development activity across frontend and backend components of an ERP/CRM system between August 11th and 12th, 2025.

**`ERP_FRONTEND\src\pages\User.jsx`**: This file underwent significant changes between 12:08 AM and 12:09 AM on August 12th. The primary change was the addition of  `'use client';` at the beginning of the file, indicating a client-side component in Next.js.  The commented-out code from the earlier version suggests a substantial refactoring to move from a commented out functional component to the current functional component implementation. The component manages user creation,  fetching, searching, filtering, deleting, and updating user data through interaction with the backend API.  It uses Ant Design components, React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), Redux for state management, and `axios` for API calls.

**`ERP_BACKEND\src\routes\appRoutes\appApi.js`**: This file had minor changes between 12:12:03 AM and 12:12:25 AM on August 12th.  The update involved uncommenting a line `router.route(`/${entity}/listAll`).get(catchErrors(controller['listAll']));`, adding a new API endpoint for retrieving a complete list of entities. This suggests the addition of functionality to retrieve all data without filtering or other parameters. The file defines API routes using Express.js, handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, search, filtering, and summary functionalities for different entities.  Specific routes are added for email sending (`/mail`) for invoices, quotes, and payments, and for quote conversion (`/convert`).

**`ERP_FRONTEND\src\request\request.js`**: This file was updated at 12:16:26 AM on August 12th.  The key change was the addition of the `listAll` function, mirroring the addition of the `/listAll` route on the backend.  This file contains a collection of asynchronous functions to interact with the backend API using `axios`. Each function handles a specific type of API request (create, read, update, delete, filter, search, list, and others) and includes error and success handling. All functions use the `includeToken` function, which adds an authentication token to the request header. The added `listAll` function provides an additional method for fetching data from the backend.

In summary, the changes reflect an iterative development process. The backend added a new API endpoint for retrieving all data and the frontend was updated to incorporate this new endpoint, alongside  refactoring of the user interface component.  The consistent use of `axios`, error handling, and success handling throughout the `request.js` file demonstrates a well-structured approach to API interactions.  The use of `import.meta.env` in the frontend suggests a setup using environment variables for configuration.


## 9:59:17 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\ERP CRM\ERP_FRONTEND\src\pages\User.jsx` between 9:37 AM and 9:52 AM on August 12, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for user management.

The primary changes revolve around the `CreateUserModal` component and the main `UserManagement` component.  Initially, the `CreateUserModal` had a minor flaw where the `onCreate` function was called twice after successful user creation. This was corrected in later commits.  The success message handling in `CreateUserModal` was improved using a `useRef` hook to prevent multiple success messages from appearing if `isSuccess` remains true for a period of time, only showing the success message when the value changes to true.

The `UserManagement` component remained largely consistent, focusing on fetching, filtering, and displaying users.  It fetches users based on active status (`get-active-users` or `get-All`) and applies filtering by search term and role. The component also includes functions for deleting users and toggling their status.  These functions use `fetch` with authentication tokens retrieved from `localStorage`.  There's a consistent pattern of using `try...catch` blocks for error handling in asynchronous operations.  The styling of the component is also iteratively refined throughout the commits.  Notably, the code consistently uses the `useLanguage` hook for internationalization.  The final version of the code shows improvements to the  `CreateUserModal`  by including the `onClose()` function call within the `useEffect` hook related to `isSuccess`, closing the modal after successful user creation.


## 10:59:55 AM
The `Header.jsx` component was updated on August 12, 2025, at 9:01:33 AM.  The changes primarily focus on modifying the user interface based on user roles and authentication status.

**Key Changes:**

* **Conditional Rendering:** The header's content dynamically changes depending on the user's `roleType` (e.g., "Freebies," "Enterprise," "Agency," "Skribe") and `loginStatus`.  If the user is a "Freebies" user, a warning banner appears if their remaining days are less than or equal to 7.  A "Go to Skribe" button appears for logged-in users with certain roles; otherwise, a "Sign up for Skribe" button is shown.

* **User Authentication and API calls:** The component interacts with several services (`userService`, `authService`, `tokenService`) to manage user authentication, retrieve user information, and handle logout.  It makes API calls to `/api/remove-cookie` during logout and uses several endpoints (e.g., `TRANSFERTOEKN`, `SIGNUPAPI`, `FREEBIES_EXPIRE_DAY`, `Authenticate/logout`). The `fetchTransferToken` function retrieves a temporary token, potentially for password reset or account linking.  Error handling is included for API calls.

* **Signup Flow:** A signup flow is implemented using a popup (`SelectPopup`) that allows the user to choose between "Agency" or "Enterprise" before proceeding. This flow utilizes the `SIGNUPAPI` endpoint. Different notification messages are displayed depending on the server response (e.g., "Success," "AlreadyFreebiesUser," "AlreadySkribeUser," "FreebiesExpired").

* **Tracking:**  The `sendTrackingData` function is used to send tracking data upon clicking the "Go to Skribe" button.

* **State Management:**  The component uses `useState` extensively to manage various aspects of its UI, including dropdown visibility, popup visibility, user information, token, login status, and remaining freebie days.  `useEffect` hooks are used for side effects such as fetching user roles, handling dropdown clicks outside the dropdown area, and managing the countdown for freebie expiration.

* **UI elements:** The header includes a logo, navigation links ("Summary"), and a dropdown menu (currently inactive).

In summary, this code update significantly enhances the user experience by providing dynamic content and functionality based on user authentication and role, improving the signup process, and adding error handling and tracking.  The componentâ€™s logic is complex, managing multiple states and asynchronous operations.  The commented-out code suggests potential future features or previous implementations.


## 12:59:52 PM
The `EmailPreview.jsx` component, last updated on August 12, 2025, at 12:55:27 PM,  manages the preview and editing of email content for social media campaigns.  It fetches draft data (including deliverables and campaign brief) using a `userService` and allows editing of email content before and after the deliverables section.  The component uses several utility functions for sanitizing content, generating a deliverable table, converting HTML to plain text, and splitting/reconstructing the email body.  It includes functionality to handle removing attachments, updating the campaign brief, and validating the email body length (maximum 4000 characters per section).  The email body is constructed from editable pre- and post-deliverable content sections, along with dynamically generated deliverable and campaign brief sections.  Error handling is included for various API calls, displaying notifications to the user.  The component utilizes local storage to access user information for a default signature.  Significant changes likely occurred around the timestamp indicated, reflecting updates to the email content editing functionality and data handling.  The code uses regular expressions to extract the campaign brief from the email content.  There is extensive use of asynchronous operations for API interactions.


## 1:59:54 PM
The log shows updates to two React components.

`EmailPreview.jsx` (8/12/2025, 1:03:20 PM): This component handles the preview and editing of email content, likely for marketing campaigns.  It fetches draft data (including attachments) using a `userService`, allows editing of pre- and post-deliverable content, and updates the email body accordingly.  Significant functionality includes: sanitizing content for display, generating a deliverable table,  splitting the email content for editing, and reconstructing the full content. There's also functionality for removing attachments and updating the campaign brief. The component utilizes several utility functions for tasks such as converting HTML to plain text and sending tracking data.  Error handling is included via `useNotification`. Input validation restricts the length of the editable content (4000 characters maximum).

`ManualAndRange.jsx` (8/12/2025, 1:55:12 PM): This component provides a range slider with input boxes for manual adjustments of minimum and maximum values. It features a dropdown for selecting between "K" (thousands) and "M" (millions) notations. The component dynamically updates the range slider's visual representation based on the chosen values and notation.  The input validation ensures numeric input and allows for a single decimal point. There is client-side input validation and error handling implemented.  The `formatNumber` function handles the display formatting of numbers in 'K' and 'M' notations. The component manages the visual representation of the range, ensuring smooth interaction between the slider and input fields.  Clicking outside the dropdown menus closes them.


## 2:59:56 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ManualAndRange.jsx` between 2:00:59 PM and 2:59:34 PM on August 12, 2025,  and one revision to `DiscoverInfluencers.jsx` at 2:48:39 PM on the same day.

The `ManualAndRange.jsx` file underwent significant changes focused on improving the handling of input values and the UI for a double range slider with numeric input fields.  Initial versions contained commented-out code suggesting iterative development.  Later versions added input validation to prevent non-numeric characters and enforce minimum values (particularly for the maximum value input, preventing it from falling below 10 or `minVal + 1`).  Improvements also include enhanced dropdown menu behavior for notation selection ("K" or "M"), ensuring proper handling of user input and preventing unexpected behavior.  The final revision at 2:59:34 PM completely commented out the entire component.


The `DiscoverInfluencers.jsx` file, updated at 2:48:39 PM, is a React component for discovering influencers. It uses several other components (`DoubleRange`, `InfluencersTable`, `ManualAndRange`, `InsightsTooltip`, `MultiSelectDropdown`) and interacts with services (`userService`) to fetch and display influencer data. The component manages various filter states (categories, locations, languages, gender, engagement rate, followers, category size, sorting),  handles search functionality, and updates a draft URL.  The most noteworthy aspects are its extensive filtering capabilities and integration with a backend service to retrieve and manage influencer data.  It uses `useSearchParams` and `useRouter` for navigation and parameter handling, `useNotification` for user feedback, and custom hooks (`useInitialData`) for data fetching and management. The component's `getInstagramData` function makes API calls to fetch influencer data based on the applied filters.  A `sendTrackingData` function is used to track user interactions.


## 3:59:53 PM
The log shows two nearly identical commits to `ManualAndRange.jsx` within a minute of each other on August 12, 2025, at approximately 3:04 PM and 3:05 PM.  The file contains React code for a double range slider component with input boxes that allow users to specify minimum and maximum values.  These values are displayed with "K" (thousands) or "M" (millions) suffixes based on magnitude.  The component uses two range inputs, updates the displayed range visually, and handles input changes, ensuring that the minimum value is less than the maximum value.  The code includes several `useEffect` hooks to manage state and handle dropdown interactions for notation selection ("K" or "M").  There are no substantive differences between the two commits; they appear to be nearly identical snapshots of the code.
