# Activity Summary for 8/12/2025

## 12:18:24 AM
The log shows development activity across frontend and backend components of an ERP/CRM system between August 11th and 12th, 2025.

**`ERP_FRONTEND\src\pages\User.jsx`**: This file underwent significant changes between 12:08 AM and 12:09 AM on August 12th. The primary change was the addition of  `'use client';` at the beginning of the file, indicating a client-side component in Next.js.  The commented-out code from the earlier version suggests a substantial refactoring to move from a commented out functional component to the current functional component implementation. The component manages user creation,  fetching, searching, filtering, deleting, and updating user data through interaction with the backend API.  It uses Ant Design components, React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), Redux for state management, and `axios` for API calls.

**`ERP_BACKEND\src\routes\appRoutes\appApi.js`**: This file had minor changes between 12:12:03 AM and 12:12:25 AM on August 12th.  The update involved uncommenting a line `router.route(`/${entity}/listAll`).get(catchErrors(controller['listAll']));`, adding a new API endpoint for retrieving a complete list of entities. This suggests the addition of functionality to retrieve all data without filtering or other parameters. The file defines API routes using Express.js, handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, search, filtering, and summary functionalities for different entities.  Specific routes are added for email sending (`/mail`) for invoices, quotes, and payments, and for quote conversion (`/convert`).

**`ERP_FRONTEND\src\request\request.js`**: This file was updated at 12:16:26 AM on August 12th.  The key change was the addition of the `listAll` function, mirroring the addition of the `/listAll` route on the backend.  This file contains a collection of asynchronous functions to interact with the backend API using `axios`. Each function handles a specific type of API request (create, read, update, delete, filter, search, list, and others) and includes error and success handling. All functions use the `includeToken` function, which adds an authentication token to the request header. The added `listAll` function provides an additional method for fetching data from the backend.

In summary, the changes reflect an iterative development process. The backend added a new API endpoint for retrieving all data and the frontend was updated to incorporate this new endpoint, alongside  refactoring of the user interface component.  The consistent use of `axios`, error handling, and success handling throughout the `request.js` file demonstrates a well-structured approach to API interactions.  The use of `import.meta.env` in the frontend suggests a setup using environment variables for configuration.
