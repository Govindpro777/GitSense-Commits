# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 12:46:54 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple React component files within a  `Wheelyfix-Automotive` project on August 17, 2025.

The `Register.tsx` file (12:35:06 PM) contains a React component for user registration.  It implements a multi-step form using `useState` for managing form data and current step,  `motion` for animations, and `lucide-react` icons. The form handles user input, navigation between steps, and submission, including password matching validation.  The component uses a custom authentication hook (`useAuth`) for registration.

The `Login.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions.  The initial version (12:36:02 PM) shows a login component with styling, error handling, and feature highlights. It uses `useAuth` for authentication and `lucide-react` icons.  A later version (12:38:52 PM) was commented out, suggesting a potential rollback or refactoring, followed by another version with added basic input validation.  The changes primarily involved commenting out the entire component initially then adding it back with minor modifications.

The `App.tsx` file (12:42:16 PM) defines the application's routing using `react-router-dom`.  It sets up routes for various pages, including login, registration, services, booking, cart, blogs, about, contact, and an admin dashboard.  Protected routes are used for access control to certain pages (`Booking`, `Cart`, `Admin`).  The app uses `react-query` for data fetching and caching and includes a `Toaster` component for notifications.  The routing also includes specific service pages under `/services`.


A pattern observed is the extensive use of Tailwind CSS for styling and `lucide-react` for icons across the components.  The significant changes revolve around the Login component's implementation and potential debugging. The timestamps show a quick succession of edits to `Login.tsx`, indicating iterative development or troubleshooting.


## 12:47:40 PM
The log shows modifications to environment variables in a `.env` file within the `Wheelyfix-Automotive_backend` project.  The primary changes involve the `MONGODB_URI` variable, indicating a shift in the MongoDB connection string.  Initially, an example `.env.example` file contains options for connecting to both a MongoDB Atlas cluster and a local MongoDB instance.

At 12:15:45 PM on August 17th, 2025, the `.env` file was updated to use a connection string pointing to `mongodb+srv://prajapatigovind866:77spQI85dtomU7g6@cluster0.c8mpiv9.mongodb.net/StudyNotion`.  A minute later, at 12:16:04 PM,  a further update changed the database name within this connection string from `StudyNotion` to `wheelyfix`, suggesting a correction was made.  The `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, and `NODE_ENV` variables remain consistent across these changes, with `NODE_ENV` staying set to `development` and the `PORT` remaining at 5000.  The commented-out lines in the `.env` file also suggest that there was initial consideration of using the  `mongodb+srv://riturajgupta499:qUIICffFBUfBvZFz@rituraj.hadlokn.mongodb.net/wheelyfix` connection string, though it was ultimately not used.
