# Activity Summary for 8/5/2025

## 3:39:10 PM
The log shows significant changes to the `Signup2.jsx` component over a short period on August 5th, 2025.  Initial versions (3:00:17 PM and 3:05:43 PM) were nearly identical, featuring a multi-step signup form with fields for name, work email, designation, company, influencer marketing activities, monthly spend, current tools, agency collaboration, and biggest pain points. The form used Tailwind CSS for styling and included social media links in the footer.

Between 3:05:43 PM and 3:09:05 PM, the background images (`/assets/social-loginbg1.png`, `/assets/social-loginbg2.png`) were replaced with a single WebP image (`/assets/social-bg.webp`).  Subsequently, at 3:09:28 PM, `social-loginbg2.png` was removed entirely, leaving only the WebP image.  Further modifications at 3:09:56 PM and 3:12:21 PM focused on styling adjustments, primarily altering the background color and removing an image element, resulting in a cleaner layout.  Changes at 3:12:59 PM and 3:13:23 PM involved minor adjustments to styling and labels within the form. Finally, between 3:30:29 PM and 3:34:23 PM, the `Signup2.jsx` component underwent a major redesign.  The previous form was commented out, and a significantly altered version was added.  This new version features a different color scheme (`#F8E9C7`), revised styling using updated Tailwind classes (e.g., `focus:outline-none`, `focus:ring-2`), and the removal of some elements like the footer and background images.  The significant change from a multi-step form to a more streamlined structure is notable. The final version at 3:31:18 PM reverted some changes, restoring a background image and the original layout.  The latest version at 3:34:23 PM presents the most simplified version of the form with minimal styling compared to previous versions.


The `Signup.jsx` file (2:47:31 PM) contained a large, commented-out React component for user signup, featuring extensive input validation and handling of early access tokens. This component appears to be a significantly more complex and feature-rich signup process than the `Signup2.jsx` component.


The `page.jsx` file (3:05:10 PM) simply renders the `Signup2` component, demonstrating its usage within a Next.js application.  The use of `Suspense` with a `Loader` suggests the `Signup2` component may be lazily loaded.
