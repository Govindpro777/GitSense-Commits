# Activity Summary for 8/14/2025

## 11:12:45 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `MailSent.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`, and one to `Insights.jsx`.  Changes occurred between 10:34 AM and 11:09 AM on August 14th, 2025.

**MailSent.jsx:**  The primary changes in `MailSent.jsx` involved the styling and functionality of navigation links. Initially, a "Review" link pointed to `/insig`, which was corrected to `/insights` and then further refined to `/insights/${campId}`  to pass the campaign ID.  No functional changes to the core logic of the component were observed.


**Shortlist.jsx:** The `Shortlist.jsx` component underwent extensive revisions. The core functionality remained consistentâ€”fetching and displaying shortlisted creators, filtering by search term, verification status, and contact information, along with engaging and removing creators.  However, multiple edits focused on useEffect hooks and parameter handling, suggesting improvements to data fetching, URL parameter synchronization, and state management.  The `updateDraftData` function is used to update draft information.  The component uses the `userService` to interact with a backend API for various actions.  A significant amount of the code is dedicated to handling the selection and deselection of creators, including bulk selection.


**Insights.jsx:** The `Insights.jsx` component shows changes mainly focused on adding, removing and fetching data related to creators. The `getAllInsightsData` function is used to fetch all the insights data. The `updateDraftData` function is used to update draft information.  The component also uses the `userService` for various API calls, handling cases where a creator is already engaged or shortlisted.  A new state variable `isEngagedOfline` was added and its assignment was refined.  The main functionality of the component is to display creator insights and allow for actions like engaging and removing creators.  Additional features such as manual creator addition were also present.  The component uses the `sendTrackingData` function to send data for tracking purposes.
