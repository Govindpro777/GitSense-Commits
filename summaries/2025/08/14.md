# Activity Summary for 8/14/2025

## 11:12:45 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `MailSent.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx`, and one to `Insights.jsx`.  Changes occurred between 10:34 AM and 11:09 AM on August 14th, 2025.

**MailSent.jsx:**  The primary changes in `MailSent.jsx` involved the styling and functionality of navigation links. Initially, a "Review" link pointed to `/insig`, which was corrected to `/insights` and then further refined to `/insights/${campId}`  to pass the campaign ID.  No functional changes to the core logic of the component were observed.


**Shortlist.jsx:** The `Shortlist.jsx` component underwent extensive revisions. The core functionality remained consistentâ€”fetching and displaying shortlisted creators, filtering by search term, verification status, and contact information, along with engaging and removing creators.  However, multiple edits focused on useEffect hooks and parameter handling, suggesting improvements to data fetching, URL parameter synchronization, and state management.  The `updateDraftData` function is used to update draft information.  The component uses the `userService` to interact with a backend API for various actions.  A significant amount of the code is dedicated to handling the selection and deselection of creators, including bulk selection.


**Insights.jsx:** The `Insights.jsx` component shows changes mainly focused on adding, removing and fetching data related to creators. The `getAllInsightsData` function is used to fetch all the insights data. The `updateDraftData` function is used to update draft information.  The component also uses the `userService` for various API calls, handling cases where a creator is already engaged or shortlisted.  A new state variable `isEngagedOfline` was added and its assignment was refined.  The main functionality of the component is to display creator insights and allow for actions like engaging and removing creators.  Additional features such as manual creator addition were also present.  The component uses the `sendTrackingData` function to send data for tracking purposes.


## 1:12:50 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `Insights.jsx` and `MailSent.jsx`.  The majority of changes are concentrated in `Insights.jsx`, reflecting substantial development on the Insights component.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\Social\Insights.jsx`:**

This component underwent significant revisions between 11:17 AM and 12:59 PM on August 14, 2025.  The changes primarily involve adding functionality related to data fetching, user interaction, and error handling.  Specific updates include:

* **Data fetching:**  The `getAllInsightsData` function fetches campaign insights using `userService.get` and populates several state variables (`engagedOnlineData`, `engagedOfflineByNameData`, `shortlistedInfluencers`, etc.).  This function also makes use of several constants (like `GET_CAMPAIGN_INSIGHTS`) defined elsewhere, likely in a constants file.

* **User interaction:**  Multiple functions handle user interactions, such as:
    * `handleEngageById`: Engages with creators by ID.
    * `removeShortlistedCreator`: Removes shortlisted creators.
    * `fetchCreators`: Fetches creators based on a search term, using pagination.
    * `addEngagedOfflineCreator` and `addManualCreator`:  Add creators to engaged offline list (manually and via search).

* **Error handling:**  The code consistently handles errors using `try...catch` blocks and displays notifications using a `useNotification` hook.  It specifically checks the `response.status` and `response.data.status` fields from API responses for error codes.

* **State management:**  The component utilizes numerous state variables using the `useState` hook to manage various aspects of the UI and data.  This includes loading states, data for tables, search results, and information for adding influencers.

* **API Calls:** The component heavily relies on a `userService` which is making various API calls.  The APIs are referenced via constants defined in another file, making the code more maintainable.

* **Conditional Rendering:** The `isBreadCrump` state variable seems to control conditional rendering of a breadcrumb, based on the presence of a 'hide' query parameter. This state is updated within a `useEffect` hook that monitors `searchParams`.

* **Late-stage changes (12:56 PM onwards):**  The code appears to have been temporarily commented out entirely around 12:56 PM, before being restored with some modifications shortly after. There is also the addition of `selectedInfluencerDetails` state which implies further UI enhancements.  This suggests a potential debugging or refactoring phase.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\ScribeIntern\Socion\social\src\components\Social\MailSent.jsx`:**

This component shows minor updates at 11:18 AM and 11:28 AM on August 14, 2025.  The key change is the addition of a query parameter `?hide="breadcrump"` to the `Review` link in the 11:28 AM update, suggesting a design change related to the breadcrumb navigation.  The component's primary function remains displaying a success message after mail sending or scheduling. The `handleBackToShortlist` function is present with logic to create a sub-campaign if the number of shortlisted creators is less than 30.


**Recurring Elements:**

* Consistent use of `userService` for API calls.
* Extensive use of asynchronous functions (`async/await`).
* Thorough error handling with notification display.
* The `INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE` API is used in both components to update campaign data.


In summary, the major development effort focused on the `Insights.jsx` component, adding substantial functionality to display and manage creator information, engagement status, and other details.  The `MailSent.jsx` component received minor updates primarily affecting navigation.  The overall code demonstrates a consistent style in API interaction and error handling.


## 2:12:48 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two React component files: `Shortlist.jsx` and `Insights.jsx`.  Both components extensively use the `userService` for interacting with a backend API, handling various API requests related to Instagram campaigns, creator management (shortlisting, engaging, removing), and draft data.  Error handling is consistently implemented using a `showNotification` function from an error context.  `sendTrackingData` is used for tracking user actions within the application.

**Shortlist.jsx:**

The `Shortlist.jsx` component underwent several updates between 1:13:10 PM and 1:14:29 PM on August 14th, 2025. These updates primarily focused on refining the filtering and state management related to shortlisted creators.  Initially,  the component contained commented-out code related to selected creator IDs from URL parameters; this was likely removed in later revisions.  Key improvements included:

*   Enhanced filtering based on search term, verification status, and contact information availability.
*   Improved sorting of creators by contact information priority.
*   Streamlined handling of selecting and deselecting individual creators and bulk selection.

**Insights.jsx:**

The `Insights.jsx` component experienced significant modifications between 1:18:14 PM and 1:59:37 PM on August 14th, 2025.  The changes were spread across several commits and  involved adding features, enhancing data fetching, and improving the overall UI/UX. Notable changes include:

*   Addition of a loading indicator (`Loader` component).
*   Implementation of a section for managing campaign deliverables, including fetching, adding, and potentially deleting them.
*   Significant improvements to the data fetching logic for campaign insights and campaign deliverables, using `GET_CAMPAIGN_INSIGHTS` and `GET_CAMP_DELIVERABLES` API endpoints respectively.  These improvements included error handling and loading states.
*   The `getCampaignDeliverables` function was modified to accept a `campId` parameter and to clear the `campaignDeliverables` state before fetching new data.  This likely addresses potential issues with stale data or race conditions.


A common pattern across both files is the extensive use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`) with consistent error handling and status checks for API responses.  The use of URL parameters for state persistence and navigation between components is also notable.


## 4:12:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to four React component files (`Shortlist.jsx`, `CreateCampaign.jsx`, `Stats.jsx`, and `Insights.jsx`) within the `Socion` project's `social` directory.  The changes span approximately one hour (2 PM to 4 PM).

**`Shortlist.jsx` Updates:**

*   **8/14/2025, 2:14:22 PM and 8/14/2025, 2:14:34 PM:**  These are nearly identical commits, likely representing a minor, insignificant change.  The component manages a shortlist of creators for a social media campaign (`campaignId`). Key features include searching, filtering (by verification status and contact information), selecting creators, updating draft data using `userService.put` calls to an endpoint like `/INSTAGRAM_CAMPAIGN_UPDATE/{campaignId}`, and using URL parameters for state persistence.  The component interacts with a backend service (`userService`) for retrieving and updating data, and uses `sendTrackingData` for analytics. The code also handles bulk selection and presents a modal for campaign outreach.  Multiple `useEffect` hooks are used to manage data fetching, URL parameters, and UI state.

*   **8/14/2025, 2:58:14 PM, 2:58:27 PM, 2:58:36 PM:**  These commits progressively add functionality related to fetching campaign insights data using `GET_CAMPAIGN_INSIGHTS` endpoint.

The changes focus on fetching and displaying campaign insights data directly within the Shortlist component. The `getAllInsightsData` function is added to retrieve this data. The code also uses URL parameters to control the visibility of certain UI elements.

**`CreateCampaign.jsx` Updates:**

*   **8/14/2025, 2:24:56 PM:** This component handles the creation of new social media campaigns. It uses `userService.post` to send campaign data to the `SOCIAL_CAMPAIGN_CREATION` endpoint and redirects to influencer discovery after successful creation.  Error handling is in place, showing notifications to the user.  It also features a dropdown for selecting brand goals.

**`Stats.jsx` Updates:**

*   **8/14/2025, 2:28:00 PM, 8/14/2025, 2:28:39 PM, 8/14/2025, 2:29:06 PM:** The `Stats` component displays campaign statistics using `ReactApexCharts` for bar and pie charts. Data is fetched using `userService.post` calls to `STATS_GRAPH` and `STATS_TABLE` endpoints, with additional calls to `STATS_RAPID_API` for supplementary information. There's logic for handling loading states and displaying data based on a selected campaign from a dropdown.  The component also uses `Promise.allSettled` for managing asynchronous API calls.  The code features significant error handling and uses `useEffect` hooks for data fetching and UI updates.


**`Insights.jsx` Updates:**

*   **8/14/2025, 2:52:18 PM, 2:52:30 PM, 2:55:12 PM, 2:55:37 PM, 2:56:03 PM, 2:57:08 PM:** This component displays campaign insights, including a table of engaged creators. It uses `userService` for interacting with multiple backend endpoints including `GET_CAMPAIGN_INSIGHTS`, `DELETE_ENGAGED_CREATOR`, `ENGAGED_BY_ID`, etc.  The component also manages the addition and removal of creators. The `getAllInsightsData` function is used to retrieve campaign insights data.   Significant effort is dedicated to error handling and user feedback through notifications. There's an extensive use of `useEffect` hooks for data fetching, state management, and API calls.

*   Consistent use of `userService` for backend interactions, suggesting a centralized API client.
*   Extensive error handling with notifications to users.
*   The use of query parameters in URLs for state management across components.  Specifically, the parameters `"show"` and `"hide"` are used to conditionally show or hide UI elements.
*   Consistent use of a notification system to inform the user of errors or successes.


The overall pattern reveals a well-structured React application with a focus on asynchronous data fetching, error handling, and user experience.  The majority of changes focus on enhancing the display and integration of campaign insights within the application.


## 5:12:48 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Insights.jsx` and `Shortlist.jsx` between 4:14 PM and 5:11 PM on August 14, 2025.  The `Insights.jsx` file underwent numerous minor updates, primarily focusing on commenting out sections of code related to UI elements (like tooltips and dropdowns).  No significant functional changes are apparent in these edits.  The major functionality remains consistent across all revisions, involving fetching and displaying campaign insights, managing shortlisted influencers (engaging and removing them), and handling manual creator additions.  The code uses `userService` for API calls to endpoints like `GET_CAMPAIGN_INSIGHTS`, `ENGAGED_BY_ID`, `DELETE_ENGAGED_CREATOR`, and `SEARCH_INSTA_PROFILE`.  Error handling is implemented using `useNotification` to display messages to the user.

`Shortlist.jsx` also received several updates during this period.  The changes primarily involved refining the logic for filtering and selecting creators based on search terms, verification status, and contact information.  The `updateDraftData` function is consistently used to update draft status on the server, with `GET_DRAFT_DATA` used for fetching draft information.  The component uses `userService` for similar API interactions as `Insights.jsx`, including `GET_INSTAGRAM_DATA` and `ADD_REMOVE_ENGAGED_CREATOR`.  The component also incorporates UI elements and state management for search, filtering, and selection of creators.  The use of `useEffect` hooks demonstrates reactive updates in response to various state changes and parameter updates.  A `dynamic` import is used to load `CampaignOutreach` lazily, preventing initial blocking of the page load.

The final revision of `Stats.jsx` introduces a `showInsightsCrumbs` state variable to control the visibility of breadcrumbs related to campaign insights, making the UI conditional.  The component fetches data via `userService` from the `/stats` endpoint, and makes use of the `ReactApexChart` component, also loaded lazily.  The data is used to populate bar and pie charts. The component also handles filtering data based on selected dropdown values.  The `useEffect` hook shows a series of asynchronous calls using `Promise.allSettled` to handle responses from the rapid API, and uses `countMap` to enable efficient sorting of data in the UI.
