# Activity Summary for 8/11/2025

## 9:30:41 AM
The `Register.jsx` file was updated on 8/11/2025, 9:15:58 AM.  The key change is the implementation of a complete registration form using Ant Design components (`Form`, `Button`, `Input`, `message`).  The update includes client-side validation, uses `axios` for API calls to a backend server (likely at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/user/create` or a similar environment variable determined URL) for user registration, and provides feedback to the user via Ant Design's `message` component for success or failure.  The Redux integration was significantly improved with clearer action handling and error messages.


The `routes.jsx` file was updated on 8/11/2025, 9:25:19 AM. This update defines React Router routes for various application pages.  The addition of routes for `/register`, `/leads` and `/user` indicates the addition of new features related to user registration, leads management, and user management,  respectively.  The existing routes for invoice, quote, payment, and settings management remain largely unchanged. The file uses lazy loading for improved performance.
