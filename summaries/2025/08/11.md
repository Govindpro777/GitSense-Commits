# Activity Summary for 8/11/2025

## 9:30:41 AM
The `Register.jsx` file was updated on 8/11/2025, 9:15:58 AM.  The key change is the implementation of a complete registration form using Ant Design components (`Form`, `Button`, `Input`, `message`).  The update includes client-side validation, uses `axios` for API calls to a backend server (likely at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/user/create` or a similar environment variable determined URL) for user registration, and provides feedback to the user via Ant Design's `message` component for success or failure.  The Redux integration was significantly improved with clearer action handling and error messages.


The `routes.jsx` file was updated on 8/11/2025, 9:25:19 AM. This update defines React Router routes for various application pages.  The addition of routes for `/register`, `/leads` and `/user` indicates the addition of new features related to user registration, leads management, and user management,  respectively.  The existing routes for invoice, quote, payment, and settings management remain largely unchanged. The file uses lazy loading for improved performance.


## 9:30:50 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of HTML email templates (`NEWSocion1.html`, `NEWSocion2.html`, `NEWSocion3.html`) related to a new influencer marketing platform called Socion, developed by Skribe.

The main changes across the different files and revisions involve:

* **`NEWSocion1.html` (8/10/2025, 1:27:00 PM):** This file is a pre-launch announcement email. It highlights Socion's upcoming launch, emphasizing its features (data-driven, better filters, campaign clarity), and offers a two-month free trial for early access users. It also includes social media links and a call to action to join a waitlist.  The design uses a two-column layout with images and text blocks.

* **`NEWSocion2.html` and `NEWSocion3.html` (August 10th and 11th, 2025):** These files are post-launch welcome emails. They share similar structures, focusing on welcoming users to Socion and guiding them through its key features: influencer search and filtering, authenticity validation, and campaign performance tracking.  There are numerous revisions throughout the day on the 10th, primarily focused on minor stylistic adjustments (font sizes, padding, commented-out sections, image sizes), and some minor structural changes (reordering of elements). On the 11th, a more substantial update in `NEWSocion2.html` added a completed description of performance tracking and a note about the two-month free trial, which was then copied over to `NEWSocion3.html`.

A recurring pattern in `NEWSocion2.html` and `NEWSocion3.html` is the use of nested tables for layout, along with consistent styling and imagery from `beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/`.  The commented-out sections in `NEWSocion3.html` suggest an earlier version's different header design was tested.  The consistent use of bullet points and clear sectioning improves readability.  Both post-launch emails include instructions on using Socion and contain placeholder text `{email}` for personalized user information.


## 10:30:42 AM
The log shows updates to two files on August 11, 2025.

The `User.jsx` file (9:42:17 AM) contains a React component for user management.  This component fetches and displays users, allowing for searching, filtering by role (owner, admin, user), deleting users, and toggling user status (enable/disable).  It uses Ant Design components (Form, Input, Button, Modal, etc.), Redux for state management, axios for API calls, and Lucide React for icons. The component handles user creation with form validation and feedback messages.  The API calls use a base URL sourced from the environment variables, falling back to `http://localhost:3000/` if not set.  Authentication is handled via a Bearer token stored in localStorage.  Date formatting is included for display purposes.  The code also includes a mechanism to handle clicks outside a dropdown menu.

The `NavigationContainer.jsx` file (9:43:32 AM) contains a React component implementing a navigation sidebar for the application. It uses Ant Design components (Layout, Menu, Button, Drawer) and React Router for navigation.  The sidebar adapts to mobile and desktop layouts using responsive design hooks and Ant Design's `Drawer` component for mobile.  The component utilizes context for application state management and internationalization with `useLanguage`. The navigation links are dynamically generated, linking to various parts of the application (dashboard, leads, users, customers, invoices, etc.).  The logo displayed is conditional based on the navigation menu's collapsed state.


## 10:30:50 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two HTML files, `NEWSocion1.html` and `NEWSocion2.html`, between 9:52 AM and 10:11 AM on August 11, 2025.  Both files are email templates, likely marketing materials for a platform called "Socion," an influencer marketing tool developed by Skribe.

`NEWSocion1.html` underwent several revisions primarily focusing on the image of a laptop. Initially, the laptop image was directly embedded. Subsequent edits involved wrapping the image in a div with overflow hidden and a negative margin-top to adjust its positioning, then removing it altogether, only to restore it later with `object-fit: cover; object-position: top;` for better responsiveness, and finally wrapping it in an `<a>` tag with `cursor: default;` to make it non-interactive.  These changes suggest an iterative process of optimizing the image's display and responsiveness within the email template.

`NEWSocion2.html`  and `NEWSocion3.html` appear to be distinct email templates promoting Socion, showcasing its features.  A key change was reducing heading sizes in `NEWSocion2.html` (from 27px to 24px and 29px to 26px). In `NEWSocion3.html`, a section was added providing login information for the platform using Skribe credentials.  The image of the laptop was also modified to be non-interactive in this file as well.  Both these files maintain a consistent structure and styling, featuring bullet points highlighting Socionâ€™s key functionalities.  The free two-month trial offer is consistently present across all versions.


## 11:30:42 AM
The log shows two HTML files, `NEWSocion3.html` and `NEWSocion2.html`, containing email templates for a platform called Socion.  Both files are nearly identical, representing email versions likely sent at slightly different times.  The key difference lies in `NEWSocion2.html`, which includes an additional section at the very end, announcing a two-month free trial period for Socion.


`NEWSocion3.html` was created at 8/11/2025, 10:39:18 AM and `NEWSocion2.html` followed shortly after at 8/11/2025, 10:39:27 AM.  Both emails promote Socion's features for influencer discovery, evaluation, and campaign management, emphasizing ease of use and real-time tracking capabilities.  They are visually similar, using consistent styling, images sourced from `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/`, and a nested table structure for layout. The visual design utilizes a color palette of white, light yellow/beige (#f5f5f5, #f8e8c7, #fff2d6, #fbf0d9), and green (#00b981).  Both heavily use inline CSS for styling.

The addition of the free trial information in `NEWSocion2.html` suggests a later version of the email, perhaps sent after the initial release to highlight the promotional offer.


## 12:30:48 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `NEWSocion1.html` between 11:44 AM and 11:55 AM on August 11, 2025.  The changes primarily involve adjustments to the layout and styling of an email HTML template, likely for a marketing campaign announcing the launch of a platform called "Socion".

The most significant changes are related to the layout of text content within two columns in the email body.  Initially, the text was structured differently (with one section potentially missing a width attribute in the first revision).  Several revisions focused on refining the width percentages of these columns, iteratively adjusting the proportions between the left and right columns from approximately 30%/70% to 35%/65% and finally settling at 36%/64%.  These alterations aim to improve the visual appeal and responsiveness of the email across different devices.

Apart from the column adjustments, the overall HTML structure and content remain consistent throughout all revisions.  The email promotes Socion, highlighting its features for influencer marketing,  and includes a call to action to join a waitlist.  The consistent use of inline styles throughout the HTML code is notable.


## 2:30:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of an HTML file (`NEWSocion1.html`) and two other html files (`NEWSocion2.html`, `NEWSocion3.html`).  The main focus is on `NEWSocion1.html`, which underwent several updates between 12:48 PM and 2:26 PM on August 11, 2025.  These updates primarily involved changes to the header image URLs within the HTML code.  The image URLs were changed multiple times, suggesting iterative testing or refinement of the email's visual components. Specifically, the `background-image` URL within the `<td style="">` tag changed from `socion-mailer20.png` to `socion-mailer-04.png`, then `socion-mailer-03.png`, and finally settling on `socion-mailer-03.png` with a corresponding change to the image in the `<a href="#">` tag from `socion-laptop.png` to `socion-mailer-04.png` and then back to `socion-laptop.png`.  The other files (`NEWSocion2.html` and `NEWSocion3.html`) show different content, likely representing A/B testing variations focusing on different headline copy and introductory text, but they  were not modified after their initial creation. All three files share similar structures, using tables extensively for layout and incorporating images from the `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/` directory.  The consistent use of inline styles and image URLs points to a templated email design.  The content promotes Socion, an influencer marketing platform, emphasizing its features and offering a two-month free trial.


## 3:31:10 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to HTML email templates for Socion, an influencer marketing platform by Skribe.  `NEWSocion1.html` underwent numerous changes between 2:35 PM and 2:54 PM, primarily involving image updates within the email's design.  The image sources consistently point to the `beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/` directory.  There are several iterations of images used for the same purpose (e.g., different `socion-mailer-XX.png` files).


`NEWSocion2.html` and `NEWSocion3.html` represent alternative email designs,  introduced later at 2:37 PM and further modified at 2:48 PM and 2:55 PM. These versions feature a different welcome message and slightly altered layout compared to `NEWSocion1.html`.  `NEWSocion3.html` includes additional content guiding users on using the Socion platform after login, using their Skribe credentials.


`Forgot.html` (password reset email), initially logged at 2:43 PM, was updated twice between 3:00 PM and 3:24 PM. The most significant change is the consistent alteration to the company name from "Skribe" to "Socion" in the email's text at 3:22 PM and a minor image size adjustment at 3:22 PM as well. This indicates that these password reset emails are now related to Socion accounts. The link in the footer of `Forgot.html` was changed from `www.goskribe.com` to `https://socion.in/` at 3:23 PM.


`OTP.html` (OTP email) was modified twice between 2:56 PM and 2:58 PM.  The changes focused on adding the Instagram social media icon in the footer of the email template at 2:57 PM and improved spacing around the Twitter icon at 2:58 PM.


In summary, the code modifications reflect iterative design refinements of HTML email templates,  a shift in branding from Skribe to Socion in the password reset emails, and minor adjustments to the social media links in different email templates.  The majority of changes to `NEWSocion1.html` appear to be related to A/B testing different images for user engagement.
