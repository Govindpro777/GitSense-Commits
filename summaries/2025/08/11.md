# Activity Summary for 8/11/2025

## 9:30:41 AM
The `Register.jsx` file was updated on 8/11/2025, 9:15:58 AM.  The key change is the implementation of a complete registration form using Ant Design components (`Form`, `Button`, `Input`, `message`).  The update includes client-side validation, uses `axios` for API calls to a backend server (likely at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/user/create` or a similar environment variable determined URL) for user registration, and provides feedback to the user via Ant Design's `message` component for success or failure.  The Redux integration was significantly improved with clearer action handling and error messages.


The `routes.jsx` file was updated on 8/11/2025, 9:25:19 AM. This update defines React Router routes for various application pages.  The addition of routes for `/register`, `/leads` and `/user` indicates the addition of new features related to user registration, leads management, and user management,  respectively.  The existing routes for invoice, quote, payment, and settings management remain largely unchanged. The file uses lazy loading for improved performance.


## 9:30:50 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of HTML email templates (`NEWSocion1.html`, `NEWSocion2.html`, `NEWSocion3.html`) related to a new influencer marketing platform called Socion, developed by Skribe.

The main changes across the different files and revisions involve:

* **`NEWSocion1.html` (8/10/2025, 1:27:00 PM):** This file is a pre-launch announcement email. It highlights Socion's upcoming launch, emphasizing its features (data-driven, better filters, campaign clarity), and offers a two-month free trial for early access users. It also includes social media links and a call to action to join a waitlist.  The design uses a two-column layout with images and text blocks.

* **`NEWSocion2.html` and `NEWSocion3.html` (August 10th and 11th, 2025):** These files are post-launch welcome emails. They share similar structures, focusing on welcoming users to Socion and guiding them through its key features: influencer search and filtering, authenticity validation, and campaign performance tracking.  There are numerous revisions throughout the day on the 10th, primarily focused on minor stylistic adjustments (font sizes, padding, commented-out sections, image sizes), and some minor structural changes (reordering of elements). On the 11th, a more substantial update in `NEWSocion2.html` added a completed description of performance tracking and a note about the two-month free trial, which was then copied over to `NEWSocion3.html`.

A recurring pattern in `NEWSocion2.html` and `NEWSocion3.html` is the use of nested tables for layout, along with consistent styling and imagery from `beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/`.  The commented-out sections in `NEWSocion3.html` suggest an earlier version's different header design was tested.  The consistent use of bullet points and clear sectioning improves readability.  Both post-launch emails include instructions on using Socion and contain placeholder text `{email}` for personalized user information.
