# Activity Summary for 8/25/2025

## 12:40:31 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several HTML files, primarily `socion1.html` to `socion8.html` and `Skribe1.html`, all seemingly related to email templates.  The changes span approximately one hour on August 25th, 2025.

**`socion1.html` (Account Setup Email):** This file underwent several revisions, mainly focusing on styling and minor content adjustments.  Early revisions (11:42 AM) involved significant HTML table restructuring, likely for improved layout and responsiveness.  Later changes (around 11:45 AM) primarily involved refining the background color and  adding a concluding paragraph to encourage quick campaign setup. A final revision at 12:15 PM included further styling adjustments and added a closing message encouraging users to utilize their free trial.

**`socion2.html` to `socion8.html` (Campaign Progress & Trial Emails):** These files are email templates showing different stages of user progress within a Socion account, along with trial expiration notifications.  `socion2.html` (11:47 AM) and `socion3.html` (11:47 AM) focus on campaign success tracking. `socion4.html` (11:46 AM) presents a weekly campaign summary, with subsequent edits removing progress bars and adding an image. `socion5.html` (11:48 AM) highlights the user is halfway through their trial. `socion6.html` (11:48 AM) and `socion7.html` (11:48 AM) are trial ending soon and trial ended notifications, respectively, prompting users to upgrade with a discount.  `socion8.html` (11:50 AM) is a post-trial thank you email requesting user feedback.  These files share a consistent structure and visual style, using nested tables for layout and many similar image sources. The most significant changes in these files include content changes to reflect the different stages of the user journey and trial lifecycle, such as the percentages shown in progress bars and the call to actions.  Later edits on `socion8.html` (11:51 AM) simplified the layout.

**`Skribe1.html` (Skribe Marketing Email):** This email template shows a marketing campaign for Skribe services, with changes primarily focused on styling and image updates. An early revision (12:21 PM) contained a placeholder logo. This was replaced with the actual logo (12:22 PM) at "https://www.goskribe.com/mailerimages/logo.png".  Subsequent changes (12:24 PM onwards) focused on improving the background gradient style—shifting from radial to linear gradients and finally to a `conic-gradient` at 12:31 PM, and refining title and paragraph styling and sizes.


Across all files, there’s consistent use of inline styles, nested tables for layout, and a common color palette (#FBF0D9, #E86D70, #002B5B, #005BC1).  Image sources consistently point to `beta-app.goskribe.com` or `ucarecdn.com`.


## 1:40:43 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `Skribe1.html`, an HTML file likely for an email or webpage.  The majority of changes between 12:42 PM and 1:13 PM on August 25th, 2025,  focused on the styling of the outermost `<table` element.  Specifically, the `background` style attribute within the `style` attribute of this table was repeatedly modified.  Initially it used a `conic-gradient`, then changed to `white`, then `red`, and finally settled back on a `conic-gradient`.  The parameters of the `conic-gradient` (specifically the position using `at`) were also tweaked across multiple edits, suggesting adjustments to the gradient's visual placement.  The content of the HTML file itself remained largely consistent throughout these alterations, indicating a focus on visual adjustments rather than substantial content changes.
