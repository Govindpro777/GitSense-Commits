# Activity Summary for 8/24/2025

## 5:12:43 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of two files: `User.jsx` and `Leads.jsx`.  The `User.jsx` file undergoes several revisions between 4:27 PM and 4:53 PM with no discernible changes in the code within these revisions. It appears to be a React component for user management, featuring a modal for creating users and a main section for displaying and managing a list of users. The component uses `axios` for API calls to create, fetch, and update user data.  The code includes filtering and searching functionalities.

The `Leads.jsx` file is also updated multiple times between 4:31 PM and 4:52 PM, again with no apparent differences in code content between those updates. This component is also a React component and focuses on lead management.  It uses `fetch` for API calls to manage leads, including fetching, deleting, and updating lead statuses.  The component allows filtering and searching leads by various criteria (name, email, status, source, assigned to).  It also interacts with a reminder system allowing viewing of all reminders and those associated with a specific lead.  The component includes a date formatting function (`formatDate`) for displaying dates.  Both components fetch authentication tokens from local storage.
