# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 10:58:16 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `BlogDetails2.jsx` component between 10:15 AM and 10:28 AM on August 21, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on refining the display of related blogs and making minor adjustments to styling and text size.

The `page.jsx` file, modified at 10:11:34 AM, handles routing to the `BlogDetail` component, setting metadata for SEO purposes.  The metadata includes title and description optimized for search engines and social media platforms (Open Graph and Twitter cards).

The `Blog.jsx` file, updated at 10:11:46 AM,  is a main layout component incorporating a `Navbar` and `Footer`, and utilizes a `Hero2` component (implying a previous `Hero` component was replaced or commented out).


The most significant changes happen within `BlogDetails2.jsx` across multiple commits.  Initially, the component fetched blog details and related blogs based on a slug (converted to integer `blogId`).  Subsequent commits focused on improving the UI of the related blogs section:

* **10:16:18 AM - 10:19:53 AM:**  These commits made several iterative changes to the styling of the related blogs section, adjusting image sizes (`max-h`, `h`, `w`, `max-w`),  text sizes (`text-sm`, `text-md`, `text-xl`, `text-[16px]`, `text-[13px]`),  and spacing.  The height of the related blog images was particularly adjusted several times.

* **10:21:26 AM - 10:21:46 AM:** The image height within the related blogs section was changed to use `h-auto` with `max-h` for better responsiveness.

* **10:24:51 AM - 10:26:10 AM:** Further refinements to the styling of the related blogs section, primarily focusing on image height adjustments for different screen sizes (`md:h-[150px]`, `lg:h-[130px]`).  The font size of the "By {relatedBlog.createdByTeam}" section was also reduced.

* **10:27:19 AM - 10:28:06 AM:** The final changes in this series involved updating the text size for the author and date information in the related blogs section to `text-[13px]`.

In summary, the majority of development effort concentrated on improving the visual presentation and responsiveness of the related blog section in `BlogDetails2.jsx` throughout the morning of August 21, 2025.  The other files show standard setup for a blog page using React and Next.js.


## 11:58:59 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `Hero2.jsx` between 11:32 AM and 11:45 AM on August 21, 2025, focusing on adjustments to the featured blog section's styling and image handling.  The height of the featured blog section (`max-h-[ ]`)  is iteratively increased from 440px to 500px.  A significant change at 11:39:18 AM  alters the image rendering in the featured blog carousel to use `object-contain object-center` instead of `object-cover`, ensuring the entire image is visible within the container while maintaining aspect ratio.  Another minor change at 11:43:23 AM removes `text-[]` from the `Featured Blog` paragraph's CSS class.

The `BlogDetails2.jsx` file was updated once at 11:36:12 AM. This update modified the `object-cover` property of the main blog image to `object-contain object-center`, similar to the change made in `Hero2.jsx`,  to improve image display.

Throughout the `Hero2.jsx` modifications, the core functionality—fetching blog categories, featured blogs, and all blogs via API calls using `userService.get()`—remained consistent.  Error handling and loading states are also consistently implemented across all API calls.
