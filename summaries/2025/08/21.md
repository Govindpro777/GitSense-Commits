# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 10:58:16 AM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `BlogDetails2.jsx` component between 10:15 AM and 10:28 AM on August 21, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on refining the display of related blogs and making minor adjustments to styling and text size.

The `page.jsx` file, modified at 10:11:34 AM, handles routing to the `BlogDetail` component, setting metadata for SEO purposes.  The metadata includes title and description optimized for search engines and social media platforms (Open Graph and Twitter cards).

The `Blog.jsx` file, updated at 10:11:46 AM,  is a main layout component incorporating a `Navbar` and `Footer`, and utilizes a `Hero2` component (implying a previous `Hero` component was replaced or commented out).


The most significant changes happen within `BlogDetails2.jsx` across multiple commits.  Initially, the component fetched blog details and related blogs based on a slug (converted to integer `blogId`).  Subsequent commits focused on improving the UI of the related blogs section:

* **10:16:18 AM - 10:19:53 AM:**  These commits made several iterative changes to the styling of the related blogs section, adjusting image sizes (`max-h`, `h`, `w`, `max-w`),  text sizes (`text-sm`, `text-md`, `text-xl`, `text-[16px]`, `text-[13px]`),  and spacing.  The height of the related blog images was particularly adjusted several times.

* **10:21:26 AM - 10:21:46 AM:** The image height within the related blogs section was changed to use `h-auto` with `max-h` for better responsiveness.

* **10:24:51 AM - 10:26:10 AM:** Further refinements to the styling of the related blogs section, primarily focusing on image height adjustments for different screen sizes (`md:h-[150px]`, `lg:h-[130px]`).  The font size of the "By {relatedBlog.createdByTeam}" section was also reduced.

* **10:27:19 AM - 10:28:06 AM:** The final changes in this series involved updating the text size for the author and date information in the related blogs section to `text-[13px]`.

In summary, the majority of development effort concentrated on improving the visual presentation and responsiveness of the related blog section in `BlogDetails2.jsx` throughout the morning of August 21, 2025.  The other files show standard setup for a blog page using React and Next.js.
