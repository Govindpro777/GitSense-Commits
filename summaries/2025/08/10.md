# Activity Summary for 8/10/2025

## 12:02:46 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of HTML email templates for Socion, an influencer marketing platform by Skribe.  The main files, `NEWSocion1.html` and `NEWSocion2.html`,  undergo several iterations between approximately 11:37 PM and 11:45 PM on August 9th, 2025.

`NEWSocion1.html` initially announces Socion's imminent launch ("Socion goes live this week"). Later revisions revert to an earlier version of the announcement with the same headline. The padding in the button area of `NEWSocion1.html` is adjusted in the final revision.


`NEWSocion2.html` consistently focuses on welcoming users to Socion and highlighting its key features (influencer discovery, evaluation, and campaign tracking).  A significant change in `NEWSocion2.html` involves the addition of a section explaining how to use the platform ("Hereâ€™s how to get started..."), which is a substantial addition of information compared to the initial version.

`NEWSocion3.html` is introduced at 11:39:27 PM, including login instructions using Skribe credentials, adding a login message section and maintaining the other features of `NEWSocion2.html`.

Across all versions, the HTML utilizes nested tables for layout, consistent styling (fonts, colors, images), and links to Skribe's social media profiles.  The consistent use of external image URLs suggests a centralized asset management system for marketing materials.  The repeated "Please note" section highlighting the two-month free trial remains constant across all versions.  The files use similar HTML structure and CSS styling throughout the revisions.

The log shows two nearly identical code updates within a minute of each other (12:32:59 AM and 12:33:14 AM on August 10th, 2025). Both modifications pertain to blog post data, specifically affecting `blogData.js` and `Bloggg.jsx` files located within the `skribefrontend` project's `src/components/BeforeLoginPages/Blog` directory.

The primary difference between the two versions lies within the structure of the first blog post's `listItems` array.  `Bloggg.jsx` adds several new fields (`tip`, `example`, `link`, `items`, `mistake`, `fail`, `solution`) to the first list item within the "Axios Communicators" entry.  These new fields seem to introduce additional content related to PR tips, including examples of mistakes and their solutions.  The `blogData.js` file, on the other hand, lacks these additions.  The data in both files is otherwise identical, representing two blog posts: one about newsletters for PR professionals and the other about types of press releases. Both blog posts share the same author ("Team Skribe"), date ("02 July 2025"), and several other common attributes, implying a consistent authoring style or data structure.  The updates seem to focus on enhancing the content and presentation of the "Axios Communicators" newsletter entry,  possibly to improve user engagement or offer more practical advice.
