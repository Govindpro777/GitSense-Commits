# Activity Summary for 8/10/2025

## 12:02:46 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of HTML email templates for Socion, an influencer marketing platform by Skribe.  The main files, `NEWSocion1.html` and `NEWSocion2.html`,  undergo several iterations between approximately 11:37 PM and 11:45 PM on August 9th, 2025.

`NEWSocion1.html` initially announces Socion's imminent launch ("Socion goes live this week"). Later revisions revert to an earlier version of the announcement with the same headline. The padding in the button area of `NEWSocion1.html` is adjusted in the final revision.


`NEWSocion2.html` consistently focuses on welcoming users to Socion and highlighting its key features (influencer discovery, evaluation, and campaign tracking).  A significant change in `NEWSocion2.html` involves the addition of a section explaining how to use the platform ("Here’s how to get started..."), which is a substantial addition of information compared to the initial version.

`NEWSocion3.html` is introduced at 11:39:27 PM, including login instructions using Skribe credentials, adding a login message section and maintaining the other features of `NEWSocion2.html`.

Across all versions, the HTML utilizes nested tables for layout, consistent styling (fonts, colors, images), and links to Skribe's social media profiles.  The consistent use of external image URLs suggests a centralized asset management system for marketing materials.  The repeated "Please note" section highlighting the two-month free trial remains constant across all versions.  The files use similar HTML structure and CSS styling throughout the revisions.


## 1:00:19 AM
The log shows two nearly identical code updates within a minute of each other (12:32:59 AM and 12:33:14 AM on August 10th, 2025). Both modifications pertain to blog post data, specifically affecting `blogData.js` and `Bloggg.jsx` files located within the `skribefrontend` project's `src/components/BeforeLoginPages/Blog` directory.

The primary difference between the two versions lies within the structure of the first blog post's `listItems` array.  `Bloggg.jsx` adds several new fields (`tip`, `example`, `link`, `items`, `mistake`, `fail`, `solution`) to the first list item within the "Axios Communicators" entry.  These new fields seem to introduce additional content related to PR tips, including examples of mistakes and their solutions.  The `blogData.js` file, on the other hand, lacks these additions.  The data in both files is otherwise identical, representing two blog posts: one about newsletters for PR professionals and the other about types of press releases. Both blog posts share the same author ("Team Skribe"), date ("02 July 2025"), and several other common attributes, implying a consistent authoring style or data structure.  The updates seem to focus on enhancing the content and presentation of the "Axios Communicators" newsletter entry,  possibly to improve user engagement or offer more practical advice.


## 1:02:43 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of an HTML file (`OTP.html`) used for OTP email generation.  The core content remains consistent throughout—an email template to verify an OTP with social media links at the bottom and copyright information.  The significant changes are concentrated within a short time window between 12:06 AM and 12:10 AM on August 10th, 2025.

The most notable changes are:

* **12:06 AM:** Initial version of the HTML file was created. This version includes placeholders `{LogoUrl}` and `{otp}`.  A commented-out logo image suggests that dynamic logo insertion is implemented.

* **12:07 AM:** The LinkedIn social media link was updated to a different URL, potentially reflecting a change in the company's online presence.

* **12:07:53 AM:**  An empty commit, indicating a possible temporary save or a commit that was subsequently reverted.

* **12:08 AM - 12:10 AM:** Several minor edits were made. These include changes to social media image URLs (e.g., addition of "socion" prefix to Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook image URLs) and minor adjustments to image dimensions (particularly the Twitter icon).  This may indicate a transition to updated assets or a renaming of assets used within the email.

* **12:30 AM:**  A substantive change was made.  "Skribe" was replaced with "Socion" in the email body. This suggests a rebranding effort or a change in the application's name.


The overall pattern indicates iterative refinement of the email template, focusing mainly on the social media links and branding changes. The HTML structure and styling remain largely untouched.


## 2:02:50 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `NEWSocion1.html` and `NEWSocion2.html` between 1:09 AM and 1:52 AM on August 10th, 2025.  The majority of changes in `NEWSocion1.html` involve adjustments to font sizes and styles, particularly headings (h1 and h2) and paragraph text (p).  The font sizes are iteratively decreased, going from sizes 24px and 26px down to 14px and 24px for the headings and 19px to 16px for paragraphs in several revisions.  There is also a later significant change (around 1:16 AM) adding styles to prevent dark mode inversion across the email body with the addition of  `color-scheme: only light;` and class-specific stylings for background and text color.  The image height for the laptop image (`socion-mailer24.png`) is also adjusted, and padding values are tweaked in various table cells.

`NEWSocion2.html` undergoes fewer revisions.  The most notable changes are: improved alt text for the laptop image (adding "Laptop screenshot of Socion platform"), removal of unnecessary inline styles from the laptop image, and potential image replacement. The original image source was `socion-mailer24.png`, and this was later changed to `socionmailer9.png` from a different CDN.  Overall,  `NEWSocion2.html` maintains a more consistent structure compared to the frequent styling alterations in `NEWSocion1.html`.  Both files share a similar HTML structure, employing nested tables for layout, using many inline styles, and  containing numerous image references from the `https://beta-app.goskribe.com/mailer/` and `https://ucarecdn.com/` paths.
