# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 11:02:45 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the `DemoCards.js` and `BookingDemo.js` components within a React-based learning management system (LMS) frontend.  There were multiple revisions to `DemoCards.js` between 10:41 AM and 10:58 AM, suggesting iterative development and refinement of the course display.  These revisions don't appear to significantly alter the core functionality; rather, they likely involve minor bug fixes or UI improvements.  The code consistently uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), Next.js features (`useRouter`, `useSearchParams`, `Image`), and a Lucide React icon library. A significant portion of the code is dedicated to handling teacher data, including error handling and fallback mechanisms for missing teacher information.  The code also includes search functionality and course filtering.

`BookingDemo.js` (updated between 10:58 AM and 10:59 AM) is a component responsible for handling demo course booking.  It fetches course details, likely via an API call to `/v1/demos/${courseId}`, and displays teacher selection options.  A key feature is the fetching and display of available time slots using API call to `/v1/time-slots/get-slots`. The component handles teacher selection, date selection, and slot selection, culminating in a booking action (currently a placeholder toast message). The use of `sessionStorage` is noticeable for persisting data temporarily between component navigations.  Error handling using `toast` notifications is implemented throughout.

The `demoCoursesStore.jsx` file (updated at 10:51 AM) appears to be a Zustand store managing course data.  The store provides functions for fetching courses (`fetchCourses`), fetching individual courses by ID (`fetchCourseById`), managing a confirmation modal, booking seats (`bookSeat`), and handling loading and error states.  The changes in this file reflect improvements in error handling and more robust response processing from API calls, including better handling of different API response formats.  A notable addition is a check for a token in `localStorage` before booking a seat, adding a security/authentication layer. The file originally used commented-out code which seemed to be a previous implementation of the store, this was replaced by a newer, more refined version.

Finally, a minor change to `page.js` at 10:46 AM simply renders the `BookingDemo` component within a container, indicating this file serves as the entry point for the booking page.
