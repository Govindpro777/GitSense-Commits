# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 11:02:45 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the `DemoCards.js` and `BookingDemo.js` components within a React-based learning management system (LMS) frontend.  There were multiple revisions to `DemoCards.js` between 10:41 AM and 10:58 AM, suggesting iterative development and refinement of the course display.  These revisions don't appear to significantly alter the core functionality; rather, they likely involve minor bug fixes or UI improvements.  The code consistently uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), Next.js features (`useRouter`, `useSearchParams`, `Image`), and a Lucide React icon library. A significant portion of the code is dedicated to handling teacher data, including error handling and fallback mechanisms for missing teacher information.  The code also includes search functionality and course filtering.

`BookingDemo.js` (updated between 10:58 AM and 10:59 AM) is a component responsible for handling demo course booking.  It fetches course details, likely via an API call to `/v1/demos/${courseId}`, and displays teacher selection options.  A key feature is the fetching and display of available time slots using API call to `/v1/time-slots/get-slots`. The component handles teacher selection, date selection, and slot selection, culminating in a booking action (currently a placeholder toast message). The use of `sessionStorage` is noticeable for persisting data temporarily between component navigations.  Error handling using `toast` notifications is implemented throughout.

The `demoCoursesStore.jsx` file (updated at 10:51 AM) appears to be a Zustand store managing course data.  The store provides functions for fetching courses (`fetchCourses`), fetching individual courses by ID (`fetchCourseById`), managing a confirmation modal, booking seats (`bookSeat`), and handling loading and error states.  The changes in this file reflect improvements in error handling and more robust response processing from API calls, including better handling of different API response formats.  A notable addition is a check for a token in `localStorage` before booking a seat, adding a security/authentication layer. The file originally used commented-out code which seemed to be a previous implementation of the store, this was replaced by a newer, more refined version.

Finally, a minor change to `page.js` at 10:46 AM simply renders the `BookingDemo` component within a container, indicating this file serves as the entry point for the booking page.


## 12:12:19 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ClaimOffer.js`, a React component likely used on a landing page to capture user phone numbers to claim an offer.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout:  it takes a phone number, validates it (currently requiring a 10-digit number), and sends this information, along with a user ID and JWT token, to an API endpoint (`/api/homework/claim-offer`).

The most significant changes revolve around the phone number input method.  Initially (11:13:46 AM), a simple input field is used.  A subsequent revision (11:14:21 AM) keeps this simple input. At 11:18:58 AM,  a `react-phone-number-input` component was attempted,  allowing for country code selection and more robust number validation. However, by 11:20:41 AM, this change was reverted, and the simple input field was restored.  All revisions maintain the same core API interaction and error handling.  The UI elements (styling, images, text) remain relatively constant throughout the revisions.  The commented-out code in several revisions suggests experimentation with different approaches, particularly concerning the phone number input.


## 1:12:25 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `ClaimOffer.js` between 12:21 PM and 12:35 PM on May 22, 2025.  These changes consistently replace a basic text input field for phone numbers with a more advanced `react-phone-number-input` component.  The core functionality of claiming an offer remains the same; it makes a POST request to `/api/homework/claim-offer` using `axiosInstance`, including the user ID and JWT token in the headers.  Error handling and success messages via `toast` are also unchanged.

Between 12:36 PM and 12:38 PM, `ActiveProject.js` was updated. This component fetches and displays active projects.  Significant changes include the addition of a `WelcomeModal` component, displayed based on the presence of a `projectDescription` cookie. The component also features a fuzzy search function (`fuzzySearch`) for filtering projects,  paginated project fetching with a `loadMore` function, and  mapping between API project statuses and UI-friendly names (`statusMapping` and `reverseStatusMapping`).  The API endpoints used are `/api/homework/student` (for all projects) and `/api/homework/student/status` (for projects with a specific status).  The component fetches subject data from `/api/homework/order/subjects`.

Finally,  `MyProject.js`  was updated between 12:37 PM and 12:37 PM. This component displays the user's projects. The main change involves improvements to the responsive tab navigation.  It adds horizontal scrolling for tabs on mobile devices and ensures the active tab is smoothly scrolled into view. The tabs themselves remain unchanged, showing counts for 'All', 'At the Auction', 'In Process', 'Under Warranty', and 'Completed' projects. A welcome modal (`WelcomeModal`) is also added, triggered by a cookie.


## 1:48:56 PM
The log shows changes to the backend of an LMS system.  The most significant changes involve the `demoCoursesController.js` file, which underwent updates at 12:53:50 PM and 1:27:20 PM. These updates pertain to the management of demo courses, including creation, adding teachers, retrieval (getting all or by ID), updating, and deletion.  The later update (1:27:20 PM) added a `bookSeat` function and improved error handling and the deletion process to include the removal of associated reviews before deleting the demo course.

The `index.js` file (updated at 12:49:27 PM) shows the main application setup.  It utilizes Express.js, handles various routes (many commented out initially, later enabled using `lazyLoadRoute`), incorporates middleware for JSON parsing, URL encoding, cookie handling, and CORS.  The significant change is a shift to a lazy loading approach for most routes, potentially for improved performance or code organization.  The server listens on port 5000 (or a port specified in the `.env` file).  The code also includes a basic error handler.

There's a pattern of using `lazyLoadRoute` to dynamically import route handlers in `index.js`, suggesting a strategy to optimize loading times by only loading necessary modules when they are needed.  The `demoCoursesController.js` heavily uses mongoose for database interactions, including population to fetch related data (teachers and reviews).  Consistent error handling is implemented across all controller functions using `try...catch` blocks.  The use of Cloudinary for image uploading is also evident.


## 2:12:21 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `page.js` (sign-in page) and `CreateNewProject.js` (project creation/editing component) on May 22nd, 2025.

`page.js` (5/22/2025, 1:25:55 PM): This file implements a user sign-in page.  Significant changes involve improved error handling with `toast` notifications and more robust redirection logic based on user role (student or tutor) and profile completion status.  The code uses React-Hook-Form for form management, Zod for schema validation, and Redux for state management.  After successful login, it redirects to appropriate dashboards or onboarding steps.  The code also includes social login functionality.

`CreateNewProject.js` (Multiple Revisions):  This component manages the creation and editing of new projects.  The multiple revisions between 1:30 PM and 2:11 PM show incremental changes.  Key updates include:

* **Extensive use of cookies:** The component heavily relies on cookies (`js-cookie`) to store and load form data, enabling persistence across sessions.  This is particularly important for managing a large number of form fields related to project details.
* **API interaction:** The code uses `axiosInstance` to interact with a backend API (`/api/homework/:id`) for fetching and saving project data. It fetches subject categories from localStorage.
* **File Upload:** Functionality to upload files is added,  managing selected files, names, and responses from the server using states and a file input ref.
* **Edit Mode:** The component supports edit mode, allowing users to modify existing projects.  It retrieves project details from the API based on a URL parameter.
* **Error Handling:**  `toast` is used for user feedback during API calls.
* **State Management:** A large number of states are used to manage the many aspects of project creation, including title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type, and specific writer selection.  The numerous `useEffect` hooks handle data loading, saving to cookies, and updating the UI based on various states.


The recurring pattern across all revisions of `CreateNewProject.js` is the persistent effort to enhance the user experience through features like cookie-based form persistence, robust error handling, and clear API integration. The structure of the code remains consistent through the revisions, suggesting iterative development.
