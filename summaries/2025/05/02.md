# Activity Summary for 5/2/2025

## 11:06:19 AM
The log shows several updates to the `UserModal.jsx` component between 10:09 AM and 10:17 AM on May 2nd, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on improving error handling and user experience.  Specifically, the `toast` library was changed from `react-toastify` to `react-hot-toast`. The error handling in the `handleSubmit` function was enhanced to provide more specific error messages to the user based on the type of error received from the backend.  A minor UI update was also made to the "Create/Edit User" button in the  `UserModal.jsx` component at 10:13 AM.


Between 10:39 AM and 10:48 AM on May 2nd, 2025, a new `ConfirmModal.jsx` component was added and significant changes were made to the `UserManagement.jsx` page. The `UserManagement.jsx` page was initially commented out but later implemented with a fully functional user management system including user listing, filtering, searching, pagination, and CRUD operations. The most significant change in this file was the introduction of a confirmation modal using the newly created `ConfirmModal.jsx` component for user status toggling and deletion, improving the user experience by providing an extra layer of confirmation before performing potentially irreversible actions.  This was completed at 10:43 AM.


Finally, the `Login.jsx` component was updated between 10:47 AM and 10:53 AM on May 2nd, 2025.  The primary change was to add improved error handling in the `handleSubmit` function.  The code now displays specific toast messages for different error scenarios, such as "Account is deactivated," "Incorrect password," or "User not registered," instead of a generic "Invalid Credentials" message.  More importantly, the Login component now redirects users to different pages based on their account type after successful login.  This enhancement was completed by 10:53 AM.


The `user.controller.js` file was updated between 10:55 AM and 11:05 AM on May 2nd, 2025.  The changes included the implementation of an email sending functionality using Nodemailer to send welcome emails upon user registration. The email itself has been improved to be more visually appealing with a styled HTML template. The company name was also updated in the welcome email from "Your Company" to "Blue Star Communication" and the subject was changed from "Welcome Aboard: Your Account has been Created" to "Welcome Team: Your Account has been Created". The path to the logo file used in the email has been corrected.  The `logo.png` file was moved into the `public` folder of the `Metal-frontend` directory.  There were several minor changes to error handling and message formatting.
