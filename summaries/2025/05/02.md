# Activity Summary for 5/2/2025

## 11:06:19 AM
The log shows several updates to the `UserModal.jsx` component between 10:09 AM and 10:17 AM on May 2nd, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on improving error handling and user experience.  Specifically, the `toast` library was changed from `react-toastify` to `react-hot-toast`. The error handling in the `handleSubmit` function was enhanced to provide more specific error messages to the user based on the type of error received from the backend.  A minor UI update was also made to the "Create/Edit User" button in the  `UserModal.jsx` component at 10:13 AM.


Between 10:39 AM and 10:48 AM on May 2nd, 2025, a new `ConfirmModal.jsx` component was added and significant changes were made to the `UserManagement.jsx` page. The `UserManagement.jsx` page was initially commented out but later implemented with a fully functional user management system including user listing, filtering, searching, pagination, and CRUD operations. The most significant change in this file was the introduction of a confirmation modal using the newly created `ConfirmModal.jsx` component for user status toggling and deletion, improving the user experience by providing an extra layer of confirmation before performing potentially irreversible actions.  This was completed at 10:43 AM.


Finally, the `Login.jsx` component was updated between 10:47 AM and 10:53 AM on May 2nd, 2025.  The primary change was to add improved error handling in the `handleSubmit` function.  The code now displays specific toast messages for different error scenarios, such as "Account is deactivated," "Incorrect password," or "User not registered," instead of a generic "Invalid Credentials" message.  More importantly, the Login component now redirects users to different pages based on their account type after successful login.  This enhancement was completed by 10:53 AM.


The `user.controller.js` file was updated between 10:55 AM and 11:05 AM on May 2nd, 2025.  The changes included the implementation of an email sending functionality using Nodemailer to send welcome emails upon user registration. The email itself has been improved to be more visually appealing with a styled HTML template. The company name was also updated in the welcome email from "Your Company" to "Blue Star Communication" and the subject was changed from "Welcome Aboard: Your Account has been Created" to "Welcome Team: Your Account has been Created". The path to the logo file used in the email has been corrected.  The `logo.png` file was moved into the `public` folder of the `Metal-frontend` directory.  There were several minor changes to error handling and message formatting.


## 1:52:17 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `Invoice.jsx` and `AccountsOrder.jsx`.  All changes to `AccountsOrder.jsx`  between 1:17:04 PM and 1:29:50 PM consist of commented-out code. This suggests that the component was temporarily disabled or undergoing a significant refactor.  The comments indicate the component was designed to display and manage account orders, including filtering, pagination, and billing functionalities using a backend API.

The `Invoice.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 1:10:55 PM and 1:25:50 PM.  The first revision (1:10:55 PM) contains a complete, functional component for generating and displaying an invoice PDF. It uses the `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable` libraries to create a PDF with company details, customer information, itemized table, and bank details. A visual preview of the invoice is also displayed on the page, with a "Download Invoice" button.

Subsequent revisions (1:22:41 PM and 1:25:50 PM)  commented out the entire `Invoice.jsx` component. This indicates that the component might have been temporarily removed,  perhaps for debugging, refactoring, or integration with other parts of the application.  The pattern of commenting out entire components suggests a possible temporary disabling during development. The time stamps demonstrate a rapid series of changes in a short period.


## 6:05:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CreateNewProject.js`, a React component for creating new projects.  The initial version (5/2/2025, 5:07:39 PM) was a basic form with fields for project title, content, type, subject, and deadline.  It used `useState` for managing form data and a simple `handleSubmit` function that only logged the data to the console.

A significant update occurred at 5/2/2025, 5:13:13 PM. This revision transformed the component into a fully functional form. Key changes included:

*   **Added features:** File uploads using `FormData` and `axiosInstance`, integration with `sonner` for toasts,  `useAuth` and `useRouter` hooks for authentication and routing,  and a sophisticated mechanism for fetching and selecting project types and subjects via API calls to `/api/subjects/categories` and `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` and storing subject categories in localStorage. The deadline field was upgraded to a `DateTimePicker` from `@mantine/dates`. A budget and budget explanation field was also added.
*   **Improved data handling:**  The state management was expanded to include states for file uploads, loading status, budget, and budget explanation.  `useEffect` hooks are used for fetching subject categories, handling subject selection based on category, and calculating budget suggestions with debouncing.  The `handleSubmit` function now asynchronously uploads files and then submits the project data to `/api/homework/create`.
*   **Enhanced UI:** The UI was modified to include file upload functionality, and a more comprehensive type of order selection was added.


Subsequent commits (5/2/2025, 5:13:55 PM, 5/2/2025, 5:14:09 PM, 5/2/2025, 5:21:54 PM) appear to be accidental or intermediary commits, containing commented-out or incomplete code, reverting back to earlier states, essentially undoing the substantial changes introduced at 5:13:13 PM.

A simplified version (5/2/2025, 5:23:23 PM) removed some of the more advanced features added at 5:13:13PM, such as API calls and toast notifications. The 5:24:52PM commit added the `typeOptions` array outside the component's functional scope which seems like an optimization change. The following commits (5/2/2025, 5:33:24 PM, 5/2/2025, 5:34:13 PM) further refine the project type selection, replacing a `<select>` element with a dynamically generated list based on the `typeOptions` array.

The final two commits (5/2/2025, 5:55:30 PM and 5/2/2025, 5:55:59 PM) and 5/2/2025, 6:02:46 PM are commented-out code reverting the component back to earlier versions. The final change at 5/2/2025, 6:04:06 PM shows a version similar to the 5:24:52 PM commit, but with the `typeOptions` array reordered alphabetically.

The recurring pattern is a cycle of adding substantial functionality, followed by reversions to simpler versions, with final commits representing a relatively minor change in organization. The core functionality of the component, which is creating a project submission form, remains consistent throughout the revisions.
