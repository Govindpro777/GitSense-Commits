# Activity Summary for 5/4/2025

## 12:38:59 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two React component files between 12:15 AM and 12:25 AM on May 4th, 2025.

`CreateNewProject.js`: This file underwent several revisions within a short time frame.  All revisions contain commented-out code representing a React component for creating a new project. The component includes form fields for project title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type, specific writer selection, and word count.  It also features category and subject management using local storage and `useEffect` hooks to manage state updates based on selected categories. The code remains largely unchanged across the revisions, suggesting minor edits or potential experimentation rather than substantial structural changes.


`Navbar.js`: This file, updated at 12:22:23 AM, shows a React component for a navigation bar.  The component uses Next.js's `useRouter` and `useClient` for routing and client-side rendering. It fetches and displays notifications, allowing users to mark them as read individually or all at once.  The functionality uses cookies for authentication (`userId`, `jwtToken`),  `axiosInstance` for API calls, and React Redux for state management (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`).  The component also includes features for finding tutors, accessing chat and referral sections, and displaying user profile information via a `ProfileMenu` component.  The notification section includes filtering by asset type ("All", "LESSON_REQUEST", "LESSON_ISSUE").  A modal displays the notifications and handles keyboard navigation using event listeners.
