# Activity Summary for 5/4/2025

## 12:38:59 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two React component files between 12:15 AM and 12:25 AM on May 4th, 2025.

`CreateNewProject.js`: This file underwent several revisions within a short time frame.  All revisions contain commented-out code representing a React component for creating a new project. The component includes form fields for project title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type, specific writer selection, and word count.  It also features category and subject management using local storage and `useEffect` hooks to manage state updates based on selected categories. The code remains largely unchanged across the revisions, suggesting minor edits or potential experimentation rather than substantial structural changes.


`Navbar.js`: This file, updated at 12:22:23 AM, shows a React component for a navigation bar.  The component uses Next.js's `useRouter` and `useClient` for routing and client-side rendering. It fetches and displays notifications, allowing users to mark them as read individually or all at once.  The functionality uses cookies for authentication (`userId`, `jwtToken`),  `axiosInstance` for API calls, and React Redux for state management (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`).  The component also includes features for finding tutors, accessing chat and referral sections, and displaying user profile information via a `ProfileMenu` component.  The notification section includes filtering by asset type ("All", "LESSON_REQUEST", "LESSON_ISSUE").  A modal displays the notifications and handles keyboard navigation using event listeners.


## 1:10:38 PM
The log shows a single code change to `CreateNewProject.js` on May 4, 2025, at 11:33:59 AM.  This component is a form for creating new projects.  The update significantly expands the form's functionality to include project type selection from a large array (`typeOptions`), subject category selection, and subject selection based on the chosen category.  The component fetches subject categories from `localStorage` on mount, handling potential parsing errors.  The subject selection dropdown is dynamically updated based on the selected category.  The form also includes fields for project title, content, deadline, order type, and word count, with the latter having increment/decrement functionality (though the implementation is not fully shown in this snippet).  The UI is styled using a combination of inline styles and likely CSS classes (not fully shown). The form submits data to a handler (`handleSubmit`), which logs the form data to the console.  The component uses several external libraries like `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/dates` for UI elements and styling.  Image components (`next/image`) are used for icons within the form.
