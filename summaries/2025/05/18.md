The log shows multiple revisions to `Inventory.jsx` and `UserList.jsx`, and one revision to `AddUser.jsx` and `LowStock.jsx` and several revisions to `Profile.jsx` between 11:52 AM and 9:12 PM on May 18, 2025.

`Inventory.jsx`:  The file underwent several changes, mostly toggling between commented-out and uncommented code.  This suggests iterative development or experimentation with different versions of the component.  The final version (11:52:52 AM) is a fully functional React component for managing product inventory, including features for searching, pagination, updating product status (enable/disable, out of stock), deletion, and export/import functionality.  The component uses React hooks, Redux for state management, and custom API calls for data fetching and manipulation.  Image display is implemented using `BASE_URL` constant from the redux store.

`UserList.jsx`: This file also shows a similar pattern of commenting/uncommenting code, indicating testing or refinement. The final version (12:01:50 PM) presents a React component to display and manage a list of users. It features search, pagination, user deletion, and update functionality.  The UI components are implemented for table creation, data display, inline editing, and form handling.

`AddUser.jsx`: The changes to this file (12:06:42 PM) primarily involved adding and removing comments. The final version is a React component that allows adding new users. It features a form for user details, including addresses, role selection, and password confirmation. It leverages React hooks and custom API calls for user creation.

`LowStock.jsx`: This file (12:11:47 PM) also shows the addition of search, pagination, and sorting features. The initial version only contained basic functionalities to display and update the stock of low-stock products. The final version shows enhanced features for filtering, searching, sorting products by name, price, and creation date, along with pagination and error handling.

`Profile.jsx`: This file went through multiple revisions, mainly adding and uncommenting code blocks.  The final version (9:12:29 PM) is a comprehensive React component for user profile management.  It allows users to update their profile information (username, email, password), manage addresses (add, edit, delete), update alternative contact numbers, and submit bug reports with optional screenshots. The component interacts with the backend API through multiple custom hooks.  The changes reflect the progressive development of a feature-rich user profile component.
