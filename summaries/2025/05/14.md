# Activity Summary for 5/14/2025

## 12:45:32 AM
The log shows development of a challan (invoice) management system.  The primary changes are in the `chalan.controller.js` and `challan.routes.js` files.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Backend\controller\chalan.controller.js`**: This file underwent substantial modification between 5/13/2025, 11:45:43 PM and 5/14/2025, 12:23:14 AM. Initially, it contained commented-out code, suggesting refactoring or a previous iteration of the controller. The key additions were:

* **`exports.updateChallan`**:  A new function to update existing challans was added at around 5/14/2025, 11:54:40 PM. This function allows modification of transporter details and material quantities.  Subsequent timestamps show numerous commented-out versions of the controller before a final version is reached, possibly indicating iterative development and debugging.

* **Consistent Error Handling**: Throughout the code,  `try...catch` blocks are used for robust error handling in all functions (`createChallan`, `getAllChallans`, `getChallanById`, `getChallansByOrderId`, `downloadChallan`).  The error messages are consistently formatted as JSON responses.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Backend\routes\challan.routes.js`**: This file was updated multiple times between 11:46:11 PM and 11:54:00 PM on 5/13/2025. The changes were focused on adding new routes:

* **`PUT /update/:id`**: A route for updating challans was added at 11:54:00 PM, corresponding to the addition of `updateChallan` in the controller.
* **`GET /preview/:id`**: A route for previewing challans was added at 11:53:37 PM.  This route was then seemingly removed in a later commit (although the code shows it was reintroduced momentarily) indicating a possible change of approach or testing.

All routes use authentication middleware (`router.use(auth)`). The routes cover the creation, retrieval (individual and by order ID), and download of challans.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend\src\pages\ChallanModal.jsx` and `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend\src\pages\ChallanManager.jsx`**: These frontend components (updated at 12:43:21 AM and 12:43:33 AM respectively on 5/14/2025) manage the user interface for creating and viewing challans.  `ChallanModal` provides a form for creating challans and lists existing ones. `ChallanManager` displays a button to open the `ChallanModal` and also handles previewing challans.  Both components heavily rely on the backend API endpoints established in the previous files. The `ChallanManager` component makes use of the environment variable `VITE_BASE_URL` to construct API URLs.


The overall pattern shows a structured approach to building an API with clear separation of concerns (routes, controllers, models) and consistent error handling. The frontend components directly reflect the API's functionality. The multiple commits to the controller suggest an iterative refinement process.


## 10:46:47 AM
The log shows two entries for `CreateNewProject.js` at 10:42:29 AM and 10:42:47 AM on May 14, 2025.  The code in both entries is identical, suggesting that no actual code changes were made between these two timestamps. The file is a React component for creating or editing new projects.  It uses various libraries like `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/dates`, `lucide-react`, `axios`, `sonner`, and `js-cookie`. The component manages states for project details (title, content, type, subject, deadline, etc.), file uploads, and category selection.  It fetches project details if in edit mode (`isEditMode` is true), using parameters from the URL.  It also handles file uploads via an API endpoint (`/api/files/upload/${userId}?uploadType=PROJECT`) and fetches subject categories from localStorage.  There's extensive error handling and user feedback through `toast` notifications.  No functional changes are evident between the two logged versions.


## 10:48:40 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the frontend (`ChallanManager.jsx`, `ChallanModal.jsx`) and backend (`chalan.controller.js`) components of a challan management system.  The frontend changes primarily focus on UI improvements and feature additions to the challan creation and management modal.  The backend modifications introduce an update functionality to the challan controller.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend\src\pages\ChallanManager.jsx`:** This file undergoes several revisions, all between 12:48 AM and 1:08 AM on May 14, 2025. These revisions appear to be iterative development steps, with commented-out code often replaced or refined in subsequent commits.  A significant change is the addition of  `Edit` from `lucide-react` at 12:56:11 AM, hinting at the introduction of edit functionality.  The final version (1:08:08 AM) shows the completed addition of the edit functionality, although the code for this feature isn't fully shown.  The file consistently handles fetching and displaying challans, creating new challans, and downloading them. The code uses `fetch` calls to interact with a backend API, storing a token in `localStorage`.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend\src\pages\ChallanModal.jsx`:** This file also sees multiple iterative changes between 12:55 AM and 1:09 AM on May 14, 2025. The initial version displays a modal for challan creation. Later versions (starting at 12:56:58 AM) introduce a tabbed interface allowing switching between "Create Challan" and "Manage Challans" views.  The final version (1:09:19 AM) simplifies the "Existing Challans" view, removing the preview button, leaving only the download button.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Backend\controller\chalan.controller.js`:** This file is modified between 10:25 AM and 10:27 AM on May 14, 2025. The key update is the addition of an `exports.updateChallan` function at 10:25:57 AM, allowing for modification of existing challans.  This function mirrors the structure of other controller functions, utilizing `Challan` and `Order` models for database interactions. The code uses `res.status()` to send appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses. The other functions in this controller handle creating, retrieving (by ID and order ID), and downloading challans.  The `COMPANY_DETAILS` constant suggests the generation of challan PDFs with company information included.


## 11:47:59 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `CreateNewProject.js` between 10:47 AM and 11:37 AM on May 14, 2025.  These updates primarily focus on enhancing the project creation form's functionality by adding cookie-based persistence of form data.

Initially, `CreateNewProject.js` contained a large amount of commented-out code, suggesting a work-in-progress state.  The file managed various project details, including title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type, and file uploads.  It heavily utilized `axios` for API calls to fetch and save project data, `useAuth` for authentication, and `Cookies` for managing user data.  A significant portion of the code deals with fetching and managing subject categories and associated subjects, populating the form fields from local storage and also storing them back in cookies now.


Between 11:05 AM and 11:14 AM, several minor edits occurred with no apparent change in functionality.  Then, at 11:35 AM a major revision was introduced. This revision added significant enhancements, namely:

* **Cookie-based Persistence:** The component now saves and loads form data using cookies (`project_form_data`). This improves the user experience by preserving entered information even if the user navigates away from the page and later returns.  The cookies are set to expire after one day. Error handling is added for parsing cookies data.

* **Improved Edit Mode Handling:** The edit mode now not only sets the `isEditMode` and `homeworkId` states but also loads the form data from cookies if not already present. This ensures consistency across different entry methods (edit links or direct form submission).

* **Enhanced File Upload Handling:**  The file upload section remains largely unchanged but now integrates with the cookie persistence mechanism by including the `fileName` and `fileResponse` in the cookie storage.

The changes between 11:35 AM and 11:37 AM are minor, likely involving code cleanup or formatting adjustments.

`BidTutorList.js` was updated at 11:27:55 AM.  This component fetches and displays a list of tutor bids for a given `homeworkId`. It uses `axiosInstance` for API interaction and `useAuth` for authentication, similarly to `CreateNewProject.js`.  A key feature is the addition of client-side sorting functionality, allowing users to sort the tutor bids by various criteria (Most Relevant, Dates, Rating, Price).

`next.config.mjs` saw two minor updates around 11:30 AM and 11:32 AM.  These changes involved removing a duplicate entry from the `images.domains` array. The configuration primarily sets up ESLint, enables strict React mode, and defines allowed image domains. The environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is also configured.

`InviteTutors.js` was updated at 11:35:08 AM. This component allows users to invite tutors to a project.  It fetches tutor data based on a subject ID, uses a search function to filter tutors, and provides sorting capabilities similar to `BidTutorList.js`.  The component also retrieves subject data from cookies if not provided as props, indicating a connection to the `CreateNewProject.js` cookie mechanism.  In case of an error fetching tutor data, it falls back to using mock data.


In summary, the majority of changes are focused on improving the user experience in the project creation flow (`CreateNewProject.js`) by implementing form data persistence via cookies.  Other components (`BidTutorList.js` and `InviteTutors.js`) were updated to improve functionality and integrate with new features, mainly the sorting capabilities. `next.config.mjs` underwent minor adjustments.  The overall pattern demonstrates a consistent use of `axios`, `useAuth`, and `Cookies` across different components and a clear focus on enhancing user interaction and data management.


## 12:48:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React components within a frontend project (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).  The changes primarily focus on the display and functionality of tutor cards, encompassing both desktop and mobile views.

`InviteExpertCard.js` (5/14/2025, 11:53:28 AM): This component displays a card for inviting tutors.  Significant changes involve the implementation of an invite functionality using `axiosInstance` to make a POST request to an API endpoint (`/api/homework/{homeworkId}/invite/{tutor.id}?userId={userId}`). Error and success messages are handled using `sonner`'s `toast` functionality.  The component also features responsive design with separate `DesktopView` and `MobileView` functions to handle different screen sizes.  Extensive styling using Tailwind CSS is present to control the visual aspects of the card, including image sizes, text sizes, and colors.  Clicking outside the modal closes it.

`InviteTutors.js` (5/14/2025, 11:54:26 AM): This component renders a list of tutor cards (`TutorCard`) fetched from an API (`/tutor/search/by-subject`). The API call utilizes  `axiosInstance`,  `jwtToken` and `userId` obtained from cookies or the auth context.  If the API call fails, mock data is used.  The component includes search functionality and sorting options (Most Relevant, Least Relevant, Latest, Price: Lowest first, Price: Highest first).  Cookies are used to retrieve subject data if not provided as props, using the key "project_form_data".  The component also displays a loading indicator while fetching data. A modal is used to display sorting options and is closed on outside clicks.  The  `mapApiTutorToCardFormat` function transforms API tutor data into a format suitable for `TutorCard`.

`BidTutorList.js` (5/14/2025, 11:55:13 AM - 12:03:25 PM): This component displays a list of tutor bids fetched via an API call (`/api/bids/order/{homeworkId}`) using `axiosInstance`, `jwtToken`, and `userId`. Several revisions were made to this file, refining data mapping and handling of API responses and errors.  The `mapBidToTutorData` function maps bid data to the format expected by `TutorCard`.   Similar to `InviteTutors.js`, it features sorting options (Most Relevant, Dates, Rating: Highest, Price: Low to High, Price: High to Low) displayed and controlled via a modal. The modal also closes on outside clicks.  Error handling is implemented using `sonner`'s `toast` notifications.  A significant change between versions is the simplification of the `imageUrl` in the `mapBidToTutorData` function.

`ExpertCard.js` (5/14/2025, 12:03:01 PM - 12:41:51 PM): This component represents the `TutorCard` used in other components.  This file underwent the most revisions.  Initially, it showed a basic tutor card.  Subsequent revisions added modals for "How it works", tutor reviews, and "Best offer" explanations.  The modals use `useRef` and event listeners to close when clicking outside.  A crucial update involved the addition of a "Read More" functionality for truncating and expanding the tutor's bio.  Further revisions added conditional rendering based on bid status (`bid.isBestOffer`) to highlight best bids, and improved response time display with truncation.  The `parseHeadline` and `getTruncatedHeadline` functions handle text formatting and truncation for better readability.  The final revision refined the styling and removed unnecessary conditional rendering.


The recurring pattern across all components is the heavy use of  `axiosInstance` for API calls,  `Cookies` for data management,  `sonner` for displaying toasts, and Tailwind CSS for styling.  The consistent use of `useEffect` hooks for handling side effects like API calls, closing modals, and fetching data from cookies is also noteworthy.  All components extensively leverage React's functional component structure and hooks.


## 1:47:37 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ExpertCard.js` on May 14, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the implementation of a bio section with expand/collapse functionality.  Initially, the bio was truncated to a certain number of lines (3.5, then 3). Later versions implemented a character limit (200 characters) for expanding and collapsing the bio, improving performance.  A `showComment` state variable and `handleCommentToggle` function were introduced to control the bio's expansion and contraction.  The changes between 12:48 PM and 1:45 PM reflect iterative improvements to this feature, switching between line-based truncation and character-based truncation. The final version uses character-based truncation with a `maxChars` constant set to 200.  Additionally, minor styling changes and comments were added throughout the code.  There were no substantial changes to the other sections of the component besides minor adjustments and the addition of `font-bold` styling to specific elements.  The `useEffect` hook consistently manages click events outside modal elements throughout all revisions.


## 2:46:56 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `ExpertCard.js` component between 1:47 PM and 1:56 PM on May 14, 2025, primarily focusing on UI enhancements and minor bug fixes.  Changes include adjustments to text sizes, colors, and spacing using Tailwind CSS classes.  The `bioLines`  were modified to conditionally render based on whether the tutor has a bio,  improving the display of tutor information. The "... " button functionality was improved, changing the label between "Show Less" and "Show More" based on the current state. A price display was added, showing tutor's pricing.  A `handleToggle` function was introduced and a log statement added within it for debugging purpose. Finally, a small number of stylistic changes were made to improve the layout and visual appeal.

Between 2:00 PM and 2:03 PM on May 14, 2025, the `next.config.mjs` file was updated, adding  `res.amazingtalker.com` to the list of allowed image domains. A later edit removed  `instaxpert-student-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com` from the allowed image domains.


The `Auction.js` component was updated at 2:02 PM on May 14, 2025, showing the addition of loading states, error handling for API calls using `axiosInstance`, and improved project detail display. The changes include fetching project details and tutor bids using API calls and handling loading and error states.  Text expansion functionality was also added for the project content.

The `InviteTutors.js` component (updated at 2:02 PM) displays tutors,  incorporates API calls to fetch tutors by subject, search and sorting functionalities, and uses cookies to store subject data. Error handling and fallback to mock data are included. The mapping of API data to the TutorCard format is also more robust.

The `InviteModal.js` component, modified at 2:02 PM, provides a modal for inviting tutors with conditional rendering based on order type.

The `InviteExpertCard.js` component (2:02 PM) manages the invitation of tutors.  It includes error handling and visual feedback during the invitation process, utilizing API calls, authentication (`jwtToken`, `userId`), and toast notifications for success/failure.

The `page.jsx` file related to inviting experts was modified twice,  with a significant change at 2:03 PM, primarily integrating navigation components (Navbar, MobileNavBar), connecting to Redux store for user data, and utilizing  `useSearchParams` for accessing query parameters.  A later update at 2:27 PM resulted in an empty file.

Finally, `UploadFiles.js` and the second instance of  `next.config.mjs` (at 2:29 PM) had no code changes.


The `HomeworkBanner.js` component (modified multiple times between 2:35 PM and 2:46 PM) underwent several revisions, primarily refining its UI and adding functionality. A notable change was the redirection path after form submission, shifting from `/homework/projects` to `/homework/myorders`.  It integrates user authentication and conditional rendering for logged-in and non-logged-in users using cookies and context (`authState`).  The component also incorporates a signup modal.


## 3:46:50 PM
The log shows multiple updates to React components within a frontend application (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).  The most significant activity centers around the `RefundRequestForm.js` component, undergoing several revisions between 2:48 PM and 3:26 PM on May 14th, 2025.  These changes primarily involve minor adjustments to text sizes and styling using Tailwind CSS classes. There are no functional changes apparent in these commits; only minor styling and size adjustments to UI elements are observed.

The `HomeworkBanner.js` component was also updated twice within a short timeframe (2:59 PM and 3:00 PM), but these revisions appear to contain no code changes.

The `Auction.js` component shows a merge conflict, indicating concurrent development branches. One branch focuses on fetching project details and tutor bids using `axiosInstance` and displays them accordingly. The other branch presents a simplified structure, possibly a placeholder or a different view of the auction.  This conflict highlights a need for better code integration.  The timestamps for the conflicting commits are 3:03 PM and an unknown time later.  Later commits at 3:30 PM also show this merge conflict resolution remains unfinished.

The `WelcomePage.js` component, updated at 3:18 PM,  is a more substantial component handling form interactions, file uploads, and API calls (`axiosInstance`) for fetching budget suggestions. It uses several external libraries including `@mantine/dates`, `sonner` for toasts, and `lucide-react` for icons. This component uses local storage for subject categories, suggesting some level of persistent data management.  This component also showcases a complex UI structure, suggesting the functionality to create new projects.
