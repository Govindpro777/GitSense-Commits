# Activity Summary for 5/8/2025

## 12:20:12 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `autoAccounts.controller.js` between May 7th and May 8th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout:  auto-assigning orders to available "Accounts" users based on their current workload.  The algorithm finds the "Accounts" user with the fewest uncompleted orders and assigns the new order to them, updating the order's status to "accounts_pending" and logging the change.  The assigned user's ID and name are returned.

The primary changes across revisions involve the order notification mechanism:

* **Initial Revisions (May 7th, 11:56 PM and 11:58 PM):** The `sendAssignmentNotification` function was used (although its implementation is just a placeholder log message), and `socketManager` and `notification` models were included as dependencies initially.
* **May 8th Revisions (12:01 AM, 12:03 AM, 12:06 AM):**  The code progressively refactored the notification system. The `socketManager` dependency was removed.  `notifyOrderUpdated` from `../service/websocketStatus` was introduced and then commented out in subsequent versions. It seems like there was experimentation with different notification methods, possibly switching between a custom function and a websocket-based approach.  The final revision (12:17 AM) reverted to the original `sendAssignmentNotification` function without websocket notification.

In summary, the core order assignment logic remained unchanged.  The most significant changes were related to experimenting with different notification strategies. The final version employs a simple placeholder notification function (`sendAssignmentNotification`).
