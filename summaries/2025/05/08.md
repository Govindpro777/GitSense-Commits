# Activity Summary for 5/8/2025

## 12:20:12 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `autoAccounts.controller.js` between May 7th and May 8th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout:  auto-assigning orders to available "Accounts" users based on their current workload.  The algorithm finds the "Accounts" user with the fewest uncompleted orders and assigns the new order to them, updating the order's status to "accounts_pending" and logging the change.  The assigned user's ID and name are returned.

The primary changes across revisions involve the order notification mechanism:

* **Initial Revisions (May 7th, 11:56 PM and 11:58 PM):** The `sendAssignmentNotification` function was used (although its implementation is just a placeholder log message), and `socketManager` and `notification` models were included as dependencies initially.
* **May 8th Revisions (12:01 AM, 12:03 AM, 12:06 AM):**  The code progressively refactored the notification system. The `socketManager` dependency was removed.  `notifyOrderUpdated` from `../service/websocketStatus` was introduced and then commented out in subsequent versions. It seems like there was experimentation with different notification methods, possibly switching between a custom function and a websocket-based approach.  The final revision (12:17 AM) reverted to the original `sendAssignmentNotification` function without websocket notification.

In summary, the core order assignment logic remained unchanged.  The most significant changes were related to experimenting with different notification strategies. The final version employs a simple placeholder notification function (`sendAssignmentNotification`).


## 1:20:18 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the backend code of a system managing orders, primarily focusing on websocket notifications and automated order assignments.  The `websocketStatus.js` file underwent the most revisions,  with changes concentrated between 12:29 AM and 12:53 AM.  These changes primarily involve refining the notification system to provide updates to admins and assigned users for order status changes and assignments,  including details of what changed in the order.  The notification creation consistently uses the `notification.create` method, sending various socket events ("changeStatus", "newNotification", "orderUpdated", "orderAssigned") depending on the action. The notification text is dynamically generated based on order ID, status changes, and user names.


The `autoAccounts.controller.js` and `autoCutout.controller.js` files manage automated order assignment to "Accounts" and "Cutout" users, respectively.  Both controllers follow a similar pattern: finding available users based on account type and order count, assigning the order, updating order status ("accounts_pending" or "cutout_pending"), creating log entries, and sending a notification using the `sendAssignmentNotification` function from `websocketStatus.js`. The logic in these files remained relatively stable after the initial commits.

The `cutout.controller.js` file handles order assignments to cutout users and order status updates. It includes a function for retrieving CAD files associated with an order. This file shows  a function `sendAssignmentNotification` which is later replaced by the  more robust function in  `websocketStatus.js`.  The `changeStatusByCutout` function is used for updating order status via websockets.

The `graphics.controller.js` file manages order creation, including image uploads, user assignment, and work queue management. The majority of the changes are in creating the `createOrder` function.  A commented-out version of the `createOrder` function existed, showcasing iterative development.  The active version introduces a transactional approach using `mongoose.startSession()` to ensure data consistency. The final version includes a function `sendAssignmentNotification`.

In summary, the changes reflect a focus on improving the real-time notification system through websockets and implementing automated order assignment logic to improve workflow efficiency.  The `websocketStatus.js` file acts as a central hub for managing these notifications.  The frequent updates to `websocketStatus.js` suggest an ongoing effort to improve the notification system's functionality and reliability.
