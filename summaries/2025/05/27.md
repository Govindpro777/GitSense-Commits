# Activity Summary for 5/27/2025

## 12:43:49 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two React component files: `CreateNewProject.js` and `InviteTutors.js`, both heavily relying on cookies and API calls.  The changes span May 26th and 27th, 2025.

`CreateNewProject.js`: This component manages the creation and editing of new projects.  Significant updates include extensive use of the `Cookies` library to manage form data persistence,  using a single cookie (`project_form_data`) to store all form fields, robust error handling for cookie parsing and API calls, and the addition of file upload functionality (`selectedFile`, `fileName`, `fileResponse`, `handleFileSelect`, `uploadFile`, `handleRemoveFile`).  The component fetches project details via an API call (`/api/homework/:id`) during edit mode and uses `useEffect` hooks extensively for managing state based on various conditions (edit mode, cookie data, API responses). The `typeOptions` constant shows a wide variety of project types supported.  Multiple revisions between 12:10 AM and 12:41 AM on May 27th suggest iterative refinements and bug fixes.


`InviteTutors.js`: This component handles inviting tutors to projects. It uses a fuzzy search (`fuzzySearch` function) to filter tutors based on various fields (name, country, subject, etc.).  The key updates include fetching tutors from `/tutor/search/by-subject` API endpoint,  handling cases where subject and subjectId are not directly provided (retrieving from cookies using `COOKIE_KEY`), and fallback to mock data (`mockTutors`) in case of API errors.  A `mapApiTutorToCardFormat` function transforms the API tutor data into a format suitable for the `TutorCard` component. The component is also designed to function responsively using the Tailwind CSS framework.  This file only has one revision logged, at 11:44:51 PM on May 26th.

A recurring element across both files is the use of  `axiosInstance` for API calls, `useAuth` for authentication,  `Cookies` for data persistence using the `project_form_data` cookie key, and `toast` for user feedback.  The extensive use of `useEffect` hooks in `CreateNewProject.js` highlights the asynchronous nature of the component, dealing with both cookie loading and API responses.
