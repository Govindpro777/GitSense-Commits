# Activity Summary for 5/10/2025

## 12:58:27 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two React component files: `BidTutorList.js` and `ExpertCard.js`, primarily between 12:06 AM and 12:41 AM on May 10, 2025.

`BidTutorList.js` underwent several revisions focusing on its sorting and filtering functionality.  Initially, the component fetched tutor bids, offering sorting by relevance, price (low to high, high to low), and date. Subsequent changes modified the sorting options:  "Least Relevant" was replaced with "Dates", then later with "Rating: Highest". Finally, "Price: Lowest first" and "Price: Highest first" were replaced with "Price: Low to High" and "Price: High to Low".  These changes suggest iterative improvements to the user interface and sorting logic.  The component consistently uses `axiosInstance` to fetch data, `useAuth` for authentication, and `js-cookie` for managing cookies.  Error handling with `toast` notifications is also implemented.

`ExpertCard.js` received a single update at 12:25 AM. This update introduced a mobile-first responsive design, maintaining the original desktop view.  The mobile view simplifies the tutor card layout, prioritizing essential information.  The change involved extensive styling adjustments for different screen sizes (using tailwind CSS classes) and  the addition of a modal explaining the payment process.


The most significant changes occurred in `BidTutorList.js` between 12:16 AM and 12:17 AM, reflecting a period of rapid iteration on sorting options.  The `UploadFiles.js` file contains a component for file uploads, including features for tab navigation, filtering, sorting, and file removal; however, no changes to this file were included in the log.


## 1:58:30 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `UploadFiles.js` and `ExpertCard.js`,  and one to `BidTutorList.js`.  There were no changes to the code within `UploadFiles.js` across the multiple timestamps.  `ExpertCard.js` underwent several revisions between 1:15 AM and 1:57 AM, primarily focusing on refinements to its responsive design, particularly the mobile view.  The changes included adjustments to text sizes, component layouts, and image sizes across various screen sizes.  There's a recurring pattern of using inline styles (e.g., `text-[14px]`, `w-[20px]`) for styling and conditional rendering based on screen size using Tailwind CSS-like syntax.  The final version of `ExpertCard.js` is a complete component with both desktop and mobile views.  `BidTutorList.js` also had multiple timestamps but only one version of the code was provided, showing a component that fetches and displays a list of tutor bids, using `axiosInstance` for API calls and `js-cookie` for token management.  The component includes sorting functionality and uses the `TutorCard` component for rendering individual tutor information.  The most significant changes happened within the `ExpertCard.js` component between 1:15 AM and 1:57 AM.


## 9:45:02 AM
The log shows numerous commits to `ExpertCard.js` between 1:59 AM and 2:32 AM, all resulting in the file being entirely commented out.  A final commit at 9:26 AM shows the file still commented out.  The changes to `BidTutorList.js` between 9:31 AM and 9:37 AM  appear to be related to formatting and commenting, with no significant functional changes.  The `ExpertCard.js` file was completely commented out between the early morning and late morning hours, suggesting a possible temporary removal or refactoring of the component. The `BidTutorList.js` file, which uses `ExpertCard.js`, remained largely unchanged except for comment-related changes during the late-morning period.  The consistent use of comments across all commits for `ExpertCard.js`  and the lack of substantive alterations in `BidTutorList.js` point to a planned modification to `ExpertCard.js` rather than a series of unrelated bug fixes.


## 10:45:01 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `BidTutorList.js` and `ExpertCard.js`.  `BidTutorList.js` underwent numerous updates between 9:52 AM and 10:19 AM, all seemingly minor and likely related to code formatting or very small bug fixes, as the code remains largely unchanged across these commits. There's no substantive change in functionality apparent from the provided diffs.  The file fetches tutor bids using `axiosInstance`, sorts them based on various criteria (relevance, date, rating, price), and displays them using the `TutorCard` component.

`ExpertCard.js`,  modified between 9:58 AM and 10:44 AM, shows more significant changes.  These modifications appear focused on improving the responsiveness and styling of the tutor cards, particularly for mobile view, and adding a modal explaining the payment process.  The changes include adjustments to image sizes, text sizes, and layout elements across different screen sizes.  Specifically, a new `MobileView` component appears which indicates a significant refactor towards better mobile usability. The addition of a modal to explain payment functionality suggests an improvement in user experience.  The numerous timestamp entries suggest iterative development and refinement of the `ExpertCard` component.


## 11:45:05 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `ExpertCard.js` and one update to `BidTutorList.js`.  The `ExpertCard.js` file underwent numerous revisions between 10:45 AM and 11:08 AM, with minor changes in each commit.  These changes appear to focus on responsive design adjustments (indicated by numerous class names incorporating screen size prefixes like `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`), and fine-tuning styling aspects such as dimensions, padding, margins, colors, and fonts. No functional changes are apparent in these repeated commits to `ExpertCard.js`.


The `BidTutorList.js` file was updated once at 11:19 AM and again at 11:20 AM. The changes involve updating the import statement for `TutorCard` from a default import to a named import,  suggesting a potential refactoring of the `ExpertCard` component. Further changes to `BidTutorList.js` at 11:20 and 11:21 AM show only minor code formatting adjustments.


## 12:44:56 PM
The main change between the two commits on `CreateNewProject.js` (May 10, 2025, 11:52:21 AM and 12:43:30 PM) involves expanding the `typeOptions` constant.  The earlier version had a limited set of project types. The later version significantly expands this list to include many more project types (e.g., adding "ARTICLE", "EXCEL_ASSIGNMENT", "REVIEW", "OUTLINE", etc.), suggesting an effort to broaden the application's functionality and cater to a wider range of project categories.  No other significant functional changes are apparent between the two commits; the structure and logic remain largely the same, focusing on creating and editing project entries with features like file uploads and category selection. The timestamp difference indicates a relatively short period between modifications.


## 1:44:55 PM
The log shows two commits to `CreateNewProject.js` on May 10, 2025.  The first commit at 12:45:34 PM is a substantial addition of functionality.  The key changes involve implementing file upload, category management, and handling edit mode for existing projects.  Specifically, it adds state variables for file handling (`selectedFile`, `fileName`, `fileResponse`, `fileInputRef`), subject categories (`subjectCategories`, `selectedCategory`, `subjects`, `selectedSubjectName`), and edit mode logic (`isEditMode`, `homeworkId`, `projectData`).  The component now fetches project details for editing, uploads files using `axiosInstance`, and updates the `handleSubmit` function to handle both project creation and update.  A significant addition is the `typeOptions` object, which expands the project types available.

The second commit, at 12:46:25 PM, is a minor modification. It adds a `console.log` statement within the `handleSubmit` function to display the `requestPayload` before submission and also logs the response from creating a new project. This suggests a debugging or logging improvement.  The core functionality remains the same.  The timestamp difference suggests a quick iterative update following the initial implementation.


## 3:33:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `CreateNewProject.js`  between 3:13 PM and 3:20 PM on May 10, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, focusing on the same component.  There are no substantial structural alterations; rather, the modifications refine existing functionality. The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions: creating and editing project details, including title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type, word count, and file uploads.  The component interacts with an API (`/api/homework`, `/api/files/upload`) using `axiosInstance` for data retrieval and submission.  Authentication is handled using `jwtToken` and `userId`, fetched from cookies and/or an auth context.  The `typeOptions` constant is extensively updated across revisions, adding several new project types.  The component also manages subject categories retrieved from `localStorage`.  Error handling is implemented using `toast` notifications.  No significant changes in error handling or API interactions are observed.  The final revision is nearly identical to the preceding ones, suggesting minor edits or formatting changes.
