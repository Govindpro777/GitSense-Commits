# Activity Summary for 5/10/2025

## 12:58:27 AM
The log shows multiple updates to two React component files: `BidTutorList.js` and `ExpertCard.js`, primarily between 12:06 AM and 12:41 AM on May 10, 2025.

`BidTutorList.js` underwent several revisions focusing on its sorting and filtering functionality.  Initially, the component fetched tutor bids, offering sorting by relevance, price (low to high, high to low), and date. Subsequent changes modified the sorting options:  "Least Relevant" was replaced with "Dates", then later with "Rating: Highest". Finally, "Price: Lowest first" and "Price: Highest first" were replaced with "Price: Low to High" and "Price: High to Low".  These changes suggest iterative improvements to the user interface and sorting logic.  The component consistently uses `axiosInstance` to fetch data, `useAuth` for authentication, and `js-cookie` for managing cookies.  Error handling with `toast` notifications is also implemented.

`ExpertCard.js` received a single update at 12:25 AM. This update introduced a mobile-first responsive design, maintaining the original desktop view.  The mobile view simplifies the tutor card layout, prioritizing essential information.  The change involved extensive styling adjustments for different screen sizes (using tailwind CSS classes) and  the addition of a modal explaining the payment process.


The most significant changes occurred in `BidTutorList.js` between 12:16 AM and 12:17 AM, reflecting a period of rapid iteration on sorting options.  The `UploadFiles.js` file contains a component for file uploads, including features for tab navigation, filtering, sorting, and file removal; however, no changes to this file were included in the log.
