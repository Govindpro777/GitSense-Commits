# Activity Summary for 5/16/2025

## 12:10:59 AM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `InvoiceViewer.jsx` and `ChallanViewer.jsx`.  Both components handle fetching, displaying, and interacting with data related to orders â€” invoices and challans, respectively.  The significant changes happened between 11:53 PM and 11:54 PM on May 15, 2025.

`InvoiceViewer.jsx` (11:53 PM): This component allows for viewing, creating, and editing invoices associated with an order. It features functions for fetching invoice data (`fetchInvoices`), calculating invoice totals (`calculateTotals`), creating invoices (`createInvoice`), updating invoices (`editInvoice`), previewing (`handlePreview`), and downloading (`handleDownload`) invoices.  The component manages the state of items within an invoice, handles form validation, and uses `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.

`ChallanViewer.jsx` (11:54 PM): This component underwent two updates. The first version (11:54:15 PM) displayed a list of challans, enabling preview and download functionality via `handlePreview` and `handleDownload` functions similar to `InvoiceViewer`. It also included loading and error states. The second revision (11:54:27 PM) added modal functionality (`isModalOpen`, `modalMode`, `selectedChallan`) suggesting the addition of create and edit functionalities for challans.  This version also uses `react-toastify` for user feedback instead of `alert`.

Both components share common features:  They fetch data using `fetch` with an authorization token obtained from `localStorage.getItem("token")`,  handle loading and error states, and provide preview and download options for documents.  The API endpoints used are consistently structured, following a pattern like `${BASE_URL}/api/v1/[resource]/[action]`.  The use of `lucide-react` icons for visual elements is also consistent in both. The final version of `ChallanViewer` shows a shift towards more sophisticated UI interactions.
