# Activity Summary for 5/16/2025

## 12:10:59 AM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `InvoiceViewer.jsx` and `ChallanViewer.jsx`.  Both components handle fetching, displaying, and interacting with data related to orders â€” invoices and challans, respectively.  The significant changes happened between 11:53 PM and 11:54 PM on May 15, 2025.

`InvoiceViewer.jsx` (11:53 PM): This component allows for viewing, creating, and editing invoices associated with an order. It features functions for fetching invoice data (`fetchInvoices`), calculating invoice totals (`calculateTotals`), creating invoices (`createInvoice`), updating invoices (`editInvoice`), previewing (`handlePreview`), and downloading (`handleDownload`) invoices.  The component manages the state of items within an invoice, handles form validation, and uses `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.

`ChallanViewer.jsx` (11:54 PM): This component underwent two updates. The first version (11:54:15 PM) displayed a list of challans, enabling preview and download functionality via `handlePreview` and `handleDownload` functions similar to `InvoiceViewer`. It also included loading and error states. The second revision (11:54:27 PM) added modal functionality (`isModalOpen`, `modalMode`, `selectedChallan`) suggesting the addition of create and edit functionalities for challans.  This version also uses `react-toastify` for user feedback instead of `alert`.

Both components share common features:  They fetch data using `fetch` with an authorization token obtained from `localStorage.getItem("token")`,  handle loading and error states, and provide preview and download options for documents.  The API endpoints used are consistently structured, following a pattern like `${BASE_URL}/api/v1/[resource]/[action]`.  The use of `lucide-react` icons for visual elements is also consistent in both. The final version of `ChallanViewer` shows a shift towards more sophisticated UI interactions.


## 10:45:46 AM
The codebase shows development of a backend API for managing challans and invoices, and a frontend sidebar component.

The `chalan.controller.js` file underwent several revisions between 12:21 AM and 12:37 AM on May 16, 2025.  The main change was the addition of an `exports.updateChallan` function, enabling the modification of existing challan records. This function mirrors the existing `createChallan` function in structure and error handling.  Other functions for creating, retrieving, and downloading challans remained largely consistent across these commits.  All functions consistently use a try-catch block for error handling and return JSON responses indicating success or failure, along with relevant messages and data.

The `invoice.controller.js` file, updated at 12:39 AM on May 16, 2025, contains functions for invoice management.  It includes functions for invoice creation, editing, and retrieval.  The `createInvoice` function validates input, calculates invoice amounts (including GST), converts the total amount to words, creates a log entry, and saves the invoice. The `editInvoice` function performs similar validation and calculations, updating an existing invoice and logging the change.  Both functions incorporate error handling and utilize population for related data (order, customer, address).  A notable feature is the inclusion of  customer GST and PAN numbers in the invoice.

The `Sidebar.jsx` file, modified at 10:14 AM on May 16, 2025, is a React component for a sidebar menu. It uses `lucide-react` icons and dynamically renders menu items based on the user's role (retrieved from `localStorage`).  The sidebar includes menu items for Dashboard, User Management, Orders, Customers, Leads, Challans (depending on the role), and a logout button.  The component handles highlighting the active menu item based on the current URL and provides responsive behavior, collapsing the menu on smaller screens.


## 11:37:53 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `WelcomePage.js` on May 16th, 2025, between 11:26 AM and 11:27 AM.  The changes across all revisions are minor and do not alter the core functionality. The file is a React component displaying a modal for homework assignment details, including title, content, file attachment, type, subject category, and subject selection.  The component fetches budget suggestions from an API endpoint (`/api/homework/budget-suggestion`) based on user input and utilizes several external libraries like `@mantine/dates`, `lucide-react`, `next/image`, `sonner`, and `js-cookie`.  The code uses useEffect hooks for fetching subject categories from localStorage and debouncing API calls for budget suggestions. No significant functional changes are observed across the timestamps.  The repeated code suggests that the developer was likely making small adjustments to styling or minor logic refinements, rather than implementing large-scale features.
