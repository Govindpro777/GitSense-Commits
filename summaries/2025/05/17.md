# Activity Summary for 5/17/2025

## 12:06:48 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `ProductList.jsx` and `BrandList.jsx`.  The changes in `ProductList.jsx` span several commits between 11:32 PM and 11:52 PM on May 16, 2025. These commits primarily focus on refining the `handleSubmit` function within the `ProductList` component.  Initially, the function was commented out, then gradually uncommented and enhanced.  The key improvements include:

* **More robust FormData handling:** The code was modified to correctly append image URLs and slab data (including `couponId` and handling `null` or undefined `expire` dates by sending an empty string) to a `FormData` object before sending it for product creation.
* **Product-level coupon support:**  Added functionality to append product-level coupons to the `FormData` object, enabling the association of multiple coupons with a single product.
* **Date format conversion:** The `handleSlabChange` function was updated to convert dates from "DD-MM-YYYY" to "YYYY-MM-DD" for proper database storage.

The final commit at 11:52 PM in `ProductList.jsx` remains commented out, suggesting that the final version of `handleSubmit` may still be under development or undergoing further testing.

The `BrandList.jsx` file was updated once at 11:59 PM on May 16, 2025. This commit involved a significant refactor of the component, including changes to styling and the addition of loading indicators (`isLoading`, `isCreating`, `isUpdating`, `isDeleting`) for better user experience during asynchronous operations. The component now displays a more organized layout with separate sections for creating and managing brands.  The changes improve the visual presentation and provide feedback to the user during the create, update, and delete processes for brands.  The logic for handling brand creation, updates and deletions remains largely unchanged but now integrated within a more structured and visually appealing UI.


## 3:36:35 AM
The provided log shows three consecutive commits to the `OrderList.jsx` file within a very short time frame (between 12:17 AM and 12:18 AM on May 17, 2025).  The changes across all three commits appear to be minor and do not affect the overall functionality of the component.  The code is consistently commented out, suggesting that these commits are likely related to debugging or experimentation rather than significant feature additions or updates.  There is no change in the actual code.  The file renders an order list with pagination, status updates, and document/invoice viewing features.  The code uses React, Redux, and socket.io.  The repeated nature of the commits without discernible differences in the code suggests the developer may have been making temporary adjustments or exploring different approaches without committing the actual changes.


## 11:08:19 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `BrandList.jsx` between 10:36 AM and 10:49 AM on May 17, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout:  managing a list of brands, allowing for creation, updating, and deletion.  The changes primarily focus on the UI styling and layout.

Specifically:

* **10:36 AM:** The initial commit includes a fully functional component with create, update, and delete functionalities for brands.  The UI is relatively well-structured but uses a more verbose styling approach.  An `AdminMenu` component is included.

* **10:47 AM - 10:49 AM:**  These commits involve incremental UI adjustments.  The most notable changes involve the removal of some styling classes (`px-6`, `sm:p-6`, `lg:p-8`, `border-2 border-gray-600`) from the main container and the section element, resulting in a simpler, potentially more responsive layout.  The `AdminMenu` component was also removed in the final commit at 10:49 AM.  The changes are iterative, refining the visual presentation without altering the underlying logic.  The commented-out code suggests experimentation with a different UI design earlier.


## 12:37:18 PM
The log shows changes to two React component files: `BrandList.jsx` and `AllProducts.jsx`.

**`BrandList.jsx` (5/17/2025, 11:08:54 AM and 5/17/2025, 11:10:09 AM):**  This component displays a list of brands, allowing for creation, updating, and deletion.  The  changes between the two timestamps are minor UI adjustments. The  `h2` tag containing "Manage Brands" was commented out in the second commit.  The core functionality (CRUD operations on brands using React Query and Redux) remains unchanged.  The code uses custom hooks for interacting with a brand API (`useCreateBrandMutation`, `useUpdateBrandMutation`, `useDeleteBrandMutation`, `useFetchBrandsQuery`) and shows error handling with `toast` notifications.  Seller users only see brands they created.

**`AllProducts.jsx` (5/17/2025, 11:17:06 AM, 5/17/2025, 11:21:26 AM, 5/17/2025, 11:21:53 AM, 5/17/2025, 11:26:29 AM):** This component displays a paginated list of products with filtering and pagination.  Multiple revisions occurred within a short timeframe.  The initial version (11:17:06 AM) fetches products, allowing filtering by date range, seller name, and seller city.  Subsequent commits (11:21:26 AM, 11:21:53 AM, 11:26:29 AM) seem to be attempts to refactor or comment out the entire component.  The final commit (11:26:29 AM)  shows the component commented out and a commented-out import of `Loader` and `Message` components suggesting work in progress or a temporary removal of the component's functionality. The component uses React Query (`useAllProductsQuery`) for data fetching, `moment.js` for date formatting, and React Router for navigation.  Admins, accounts, and inventory personnel can update products.  Pagination is implemented with buttons for next and previous pages, along with numbered page buttons.


A recurring pattern is the extensive use of React Query for data fetching and mutations in both components, along with error handling using `toast` notifications.  Both components also heavily leverage Tailwind CSS for styling. The frequent commenting out of large blocks of code in `AllProducts.jsx` suggests an iterative development process or potential issues during refactoring.


## 1:36:45 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `ActiveProject.js`, a React component,  between 1:20 PM and 1:33 PM on May 17, 2025.  The code remains largely unchanged across all revisions.  The component renders a section displaying active projects, utilizing features like responsive tabs,  a scrolling indicator, and image components.  The project data is hardcoded within the component, showing different project statuses ("At the Auction," "Drafts," "Revision," "In Process," "Under Warranty").  There is no functional change visible between the different commits.  The timestamps indicate frequent edits within a short time span, possibly reflecting iterative development or debugging.


## 2:39:31 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ActiveProject.js` on May 17, 2025.  The initial revisions (1:42 PM and 1:43 PM)  contain commented-out code representing a React component displaying project data with tabs for filtering ('All', 'At the Auction', 'Drafts', etc.).  The project data includes fields like title, description, deadline, price, and bid count.  The component uses `useState` and `useRef` hooks for managing state and DOM references, and `useEffect` for updating the indicator position of the active tab.  The code also includes responsive design elements using Tailwind CSS classes.

A significant change occurred at 1:49 PM.  The code was uncommented,  and a search bar and subject dropdown were added to the component's UI.  A sidebar was also implemented, showing user notifications.  This suggests a substantial feature addition, making the component more interactive and functional.  The final revision at 2:00 PM reverts back to the commented out code, suggesting that the 1:49 PM commit might have been rolled back or was temporary.  Throughout all the revisions, the core functionality and structure remained relatively consistent, primarily focused on displaying and filtering project information.


## 3:39:30 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `ActiveProject.js` on May 17, 2025.  All revisions contain the same commented-out React component code. This component displays a list of projects categorized into tabs ('All', 'At the Auction', 'Drafts', 'Revision', 'In Process', 'Under Warranty', 'Completed').  The code uses React hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`), `next/image` for image display, and Mantine UI components for styling and possibly date selection and dropzone functionality.  Lucide React is used for icons.  The project data is hardcoded in the component as `projectsData` and `tabs`.

There were multiple edits between 2:42 PM and 2:47 PM with no discernible changes in the code.  A final revision occurred at 3:21 PM and 3:32 PM, again with no apparent changes in the code itself. This suggests the commits might represent saving or version control operations rather than functional code updates.  The core structure and functionality of the component remained consistent throughout all the recorded commits.


## 4:39:28 PM
The log shows three consecutive updates to `ActiveProject.js` on May 17, 2025, between 3:43 PM and 3:48 PM.  All three commits contain identical code, suggesting the commits might represent repeated attempts at saving or a version control issue rather than meaningful code changes. The code itself is a React component displaying a list of projects categorized by tabs ("All", "At the Auction", "In Process", etc.).  It uses several libraries like `@mantine/core`, `lucide-react`, and `next/image` for UI elements and image rendering. The component features responsive design, using Tailwind CSS classes for styling, and includes interactive tabs with an indicator showing the currently selected tab.  The indicator dynamically adjusts its position based on the active tab and the container's scroll position, ensuring usability on different screen sizes.  The project data is hardcoded within the component.
