# Activity Summary for 5/17/2025

## 12:06:48 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `ProductList.jsx` and `BrandList.jsx`.  The changes in `ProductList.jsx` span several commits between 11:32 PM and 11:52 PM on May 16, 2025. These commits primarily focus on refining the `handleSubmit` function within the `ProductList` component.  Initially, the function was commented out, then gradually uncommented and enhanced.  The key improvements include:

* **More robust FormData handling:** The code was modified to correctly append image URLs and slab data (including `couponId` and handling `null` or undefined `expire` dates by sending an empty string) to a `FormData` object before sending it for product creation.
* **Product-level coupon support:**  Added functionality to append product-level coupons to the `FormData` object, enabling the association of multiple coupons with a single product.
* **Date format conversion:** The `handleSlabChange` function was updated to convert dates from "DD-MM-YYYY" to "YYYY-MM-DD" for proper database storage.

The final commit at 11:52 PM in `ProductList.jsx` remains commented out, suggesting that the final version of `handleSubmit` may still be under development or undergoing further testing.

The `BrandList.jsx` file was updated once at 11:59 PM on May 16, 2025. This commit involved a significant refactor of the component, including changes to styling and the addition of loading indicators (`isLoading`, `isCreating`, `isUpdating`, `isDeleting`) for better user experience during asynchronous operations. The component now displays a more organized layout with separate sections for creating and managing brands.  The changes improve the visual presentation and provide feedback to the user during the create, update, and delete processes for brands.  The logic for handling brand creation, updates and deletions remains largely unchanged but now integrated within a more structured and visually appealing UI.
