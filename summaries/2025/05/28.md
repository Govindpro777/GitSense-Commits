# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 1:21:50 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions of `FAQHomework.js` and one commented-out `Rating.jsx` component.  The `FAQHomework.js` file underwent several minor updates between 12:50 PM and 12:57 PM on May 28, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `renderTextWithLinks` function. Initially, this function directly manipulated the `parts` array resulting from a string split. Later revisions added null checks using `processedText?.split` and `Array.isArray(parts)` to ensure robustness when handling potential null or undefined values for `processedText` or if the split operation didn't return an array.  The core functionality – fetching and displaying FAQs with links – remained consistent throughout.  The changes to `renderTextWithLinks` improved the component's ability to handle unexpected input, preventing potential errors.  The `Rating.jsx` component appears to be a commented-out section of the log and does not contain any relevant code changes.
