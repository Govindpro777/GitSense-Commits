# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 1:21:50 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions of `FAQHomework.js` and one commented-out `Rating.jsx` component.  The `FAQHomework.js` file underwent several minor updates between 12:50 PM and 12:57 PM on May 28, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `renderTextWithLinks` function. Initially, this function directly manipulated the `parts` array resulting from a string split. Later revisions added null checks using `processedText?.split` and `Array.isArray(parts)` to ensure robustness when handling potential null or undefined values for `processedText` or if the split operation didn't return an array.  The core functionality – fetching and displaying FAQs with links – remained consistent throughout.  The changes to `renderTextWithLinks` improved the component's ability to handle unexpected input, preventing potential errors.  The `Rating.jsx` component appears to be a commented-out section of the log and does not contain any relevant code changes.


## 2:21:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to a React component (`Rating.jsx`) responsible for displaying tutor reviews and a React page (`page.js`) for user sign-in.

**`Rating.jsx` Updates:**

The `Rating.jsx` file underwent several iterations between 1:25 PM and 2:18 PM on May 28, 2025.  The major change was the renaming of the component from `Rating` to `ManageRating`.  Initially, the code was heavily commented out.  The uncommented version progressively revealed a component that displays tutor ratings using star icons (`FaStar`, `FaRegStar`, `FaStarHalfAlt` from `react-icons/fa`), rating bars, and a section for displaying reviews. The reviews are sortable ("Newest First", "Oldest First", "Highest Rating", "Lowest Rating").  The component also handles loading and error states.  The final version is a fully functional rating component with visual improvements and refined styling using tailwind CSS.


**`page.js` Updates:**

The `page.js` file, related to user sign-in, was modified between 2:02 PM and 2:04 PM on May 28, 2025. The primary change involved refining the password validation schema (`loginSchema`) using zod.  Initially, the schema enforced a strong password policy (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character). This was later relaxed, removing requirements for uppercase, lowercase, and number in the password.  The sign-in process uses `react-hook-form` for form handling, `next/navigation` for routing, `react-redux` for state management, and cookies for storing authentication tokens. Successful login redirects users based on their role (student or tutor) and profile completion status.  The sign-in process also incorporates social login buttons (Google, Apple, Facebook).  The final change added visual enhancement to the Sign Up button.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* **React Components and Libraries:**  Both files heavily utilize React components and libraries, such as `react-hook-form`, `zod` for validation, `react-redux` for state management, and various UI components.
* **Responsive Design:**  Extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes suggests a focus on responsive design across various screen sizes.
* **Error Handling:** The `page.js` file demonstrates thorough error handling using `try...catch` blocks and `toast` notifications.  `Rating.jsx` also handles loading and error states.
* **Progressive Enhancements:** The `Rating.jsx` file evolved incrementally, with initial commented-out code gradually being replaced with functional code.  Similar incremental adjustments also occurred on the `page.js` file regarding password validation.


The frequent commenting and uncommenting in `Rating.jsx` suggests an iterative development process, possibly involving experimentation and refinement of the component's functionality and design.  The modifications in `page.js` reflect adjustments to security policies and UI improvements.


## 3:21:49 PM
The code represents a React component `ManageRating` displaying tutor reviews.  The major update on May 28th, 2025, at 3:17:46 PM involved refactoring the component to reuse the `renderStars` function for displaying star ratings.  The component fetches and displays review data, including sorting options ("Newest First," "Oldest First," "Highest Rating," "Lowest Rating").  It shows a summary of ratings with a bar chart visualization and displays a limited number of reviews initially, with an option to view all reviews.  The component handles loading and error states and uses several React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).  The commented-out code suggests previous iterations potentially utilizing different component libraries (`@mantine/core`, `react-spinners`, `js-cookie`) and an axios instance for API calls. The current version renders star ratings using react-icons and lucide-react.  The styling is extensive, utilizing Tailwind CSS for responsive design.


## 6:07:59 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components related to tutor reviews. The main focus is on `ReviewReplyPopup.js`, `EditReplyPopup.js`, and `DeleteReviewPopup.js`,  with numerous UI adjustments occurring between 3:56 PM and 4:13 PM.  These changes primarily involve styling modifications using Tailwind CSS classes, altering element dimensions (`w-`, `h-`, `rounded-`),  and adjusting the layout with `flex` and `gap` classes.  There are also minor structural changes to the component layout, moving elements within parent containers.  After 4:13 PM, `ReviewReplyPopup.js`  remains largely unchanged while the focus shifts to improving the UI of `DeleteReviewPopup.js`  between 4:17 PM and 5:33 PM, again using primarily Tailwind CSS styling.  Significant changes to `Rating.jsx` begin around 5:37 PM, transforming it from a simpler rating display to a more comprehensive review management section. This involves adding a sorting mechanism for reviews,  a section for displaying a rating breakdown (bar charts), subject tags, and a cleaner overall layout. The `page.jsx` file is updated between 5:50 PM and 5:57 PM to include an image element and adjusts positioning of this image element.  The changes to `Rating.jsx`  around 6:00 PM reflect a continuous refinement of the UI, particularly the visual presentation of the average rating and the layout of the rating summary and breakdown sections, with updates to text size and font weight.  Finally, the styling of subject tags is adjusted around 6:07 PM.  Throughout the log, the `renderStars` function remains consistent, suggesting a stable component for displaying star ratings.


## 7:19:28 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `Rating.jsx` component, focusing on UI enhancements and popup functionality, and a single revision to `InviteTutors.js`, which involves adding tutor search and display features.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews\Rating.jsx`**

This file underwent numerous revisions between 6:19 PM and 6:48 PM on May 28, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent—displaying tutor ratings, reviews, and popups for replying to, deleting, and editing reviews.  Changes included:

* **6:19 PM - 6:20 PM:**  Initial commit, showing a basic structure for displaying ratings and reviews. Popups are included but lack essential props like `onClose`.
* **6:20 PM - 6:24 PM:** Added `onClose` props to the popups (`ReviewReplyPopup`, `DeleteReviewPopup`, `EditReplyPopup`) for proper closure. Minor styling adjustments were made to the overall layout and elements within the component.
* **6:24 PM - 6:39 PM:** Further styling refinement, including changes to text sizes, spacing, and button styles.  The `select` element for sorting reviews was styled and improved.
* **6:39 PM - 6:48 PM:** More subtle styling changes focusing on text size and color in the select element and review count display.


**Recurring Elements in `Rating.jsx`:**

The code consistently uses tailwind CSS classes for styling.  The `renderStars` and `calculateWidth` functions are reused throughout the component.  There's a consistent pattern of using optional chaining (`?.`) to handle potential null values in the `reviewData` array.  The popups are consistently managed using state variables and handlers.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews\ReviewReplyPopup.js`**

This file, related to the review reply popup, was modified between 6:27 PM and 6:33 PM on May 28, 2025. The key change was replacing the placeholder image (`/api/placeholder/44/44`) for student profile pictures with a more specific image path (`/landing-page/project/avtar.svg`).  `NextImage` was also changed to `Image` component for showing images.


**`c:\Users\9195\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews\DeleteReviewPopup.js`**

This file, for the delete review popup, saw similar changes in image path  between 6:28 PM and 6:32 PM on May 28, 2025.  The changes were mostly to replace the placeholder image with `/landing-page/project/avtar.svg` and using `Image` component instead of `img` tag.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\InviteTutors.js`**

This file was revised once at 7:10 PM on May 28, 2025.  This revision added functionality for searching tutors based on various criteria (name, country, subject, experience, description) using a fuzzy search algorithm. The component now fetches tutor data from an API (`/tutor/search/by-subject`), handles loading states, and displays tutor cards using a debounce mechanism to improve search performance.  The tutor card data is mapped from the API response into a consistent format.  Mock data is used for error handling during development.


## 8:55:53 PM
The log shows updates to three files across a period of about an hour on May 28, 2025.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\lms\LMS_frontend\src\app\courses\DisplayCards.jsx` was modified twice, with minor changes between the two commits (8:01 PM and 8:42 PM).  The file displays course cards.  No substantive code changes are apparent between the two commits; it's likely minor formatting or whitespace adjustments. The code renders course cards with icons, descriptions, durations, modes, prices, and "Enroll Now" buttons.  It includes client-side pagination and error handling for missing data and empty states.  The filtering functionality shows only public courses matching search terms and active categories.


`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\lms\LMS_dashboard\src\component\learningManager\CreateDemo\DemoDashborad.jsx` was modified twice with very minimal changes between the commits (8:25 PM and 8:25 PM). This component displays a dashboard for managing demo courses, including adding, editing, and deleting courses.  The dashboard includes search and filtering functionality by subject, description, teacher, or category, along with visual indicators for loading and errors.  The code utilizes React's state management and handles asynchronous operations with error handling and success notifications using `react-toastify`.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\lms\LMS_dashboard\src\store\usebranchStore.jsx`  was modified once at 8:54 PM. This file contains a custom React hook (`useBranchStore`) to fetch and manage branch data.  The hook uses `axios` to make API calls to retrieve branches and handles loading states, errors, and updates the `branches` state accordingly. A `refetch` function allows for manual refreshing of the branch data.


## 10:35:40 PM
The log shows code changes across three files within a React project, primarily focusing on data fetching and form handling.

**`src/store/useBranchStore.jsx`**: This file underwent multiple revisions between 9:08 PM and 9:11 PM. The core functionality remains consistent: fetching branch data using `axiosInstance.get`.  A notable change is the API endpoint for fetching branches: it changed from `/v1/branch` to `/branch` in the final version.  There were also minor adjustments to the import path of `axiosInstance` from `../../utils/axios` to `../utils/axios`.


**`src/component/learningManager/CreateDemo/CreateDemoForm.jsx`**:  This file shows a large commented-out code block representing a React form for creating demo courses.  The form includes fields for subject, description, teacher selection, category, requirements, syllabus, thumbnail upload, available seats, and course status.  Multiple functions manage form data, validation, and submission using a custom hook (`useDemoCourseStore`). The commented-out nature suggests the component is under development or temporarily disabled. There were no actual changes to the content, only multiple timestamps showing that the file was open.


The timestamps indicate an intense period of development or debugging around 9:08 PM to 9:11 PM, focusing on the branch data fetching logic and potentially related to the `CreateDemoForm` component, given its proximity in time. The pattern in `useBranchStore.jsx` revisions suggests iterative adjustments to the API interaction.  The `CreateDemoForm.jsx` file's unchanged commented-out code suggests a work-in-progress or a temporary disabling of a large component.
