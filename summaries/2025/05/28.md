# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 1:21:50 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions of `FAQHomework.js` and one commented-out `Rating.jsx` component.  The `FAQHomework.js` file underwent several minor updates between 12:50 PM and 12:57 PM on May 28, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `renderTextWithLinks` function. Initially, this function directly manipulated the `parts` array resulting from a string split. Later revisions added null checks using `processedText?.split` and `Array.isArray(parts)` to ensure robustness when handling potential null or undefined values for `processedText` or if the split operation didn't return an array.  The core functionality – fetching and displaying FAQs with links – remained consistent throughout.  The changes to `renderTextWithLinks` improved the component's ability to handle unexpected input, preventing potential errors.  The `Rating.jsx` component appears to be a commented-out section of the log and does not contain any relevant code changes.


## 2:21:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to a React component (`Rating.jsx`) responsible for displaying tutor reviews and a React page (`page.js`) for user sign-in.

**`Rating.jsx` Updates:**

The `Rating.jsx` file underwent several iterations between 1:25 PM and 2:18 PM on May 28, 2025.  The major change was the renaming of the component from `Rating` to `ManageRating`.  Initially, the code was heavily commented out.  The uncommented version progressively revealed a component that displays tutor ratings using star icons (`FaStar`, `FaRegStar`, `FaStarHalfAlt` from `react-icons/fa`), rating bars, and a section for displaying reviews. The reviews are sortable ("Newest First", "Oldest First", "Highest Rating", "Lowest Rating").  The component also handles loading and error states.  The final version is a fully functional rating component with visual improvements and refined styling using tailwind CSS.


**`page.js` Updates:**

The `page.js` file, related to user sign-in, was modified between 2:02 PM and 2:04 PM on May 28, 2025. The primary change involved refining the password validation schema (`loginSchema`) using zod.  Initially, the schema enforced a strong password policy (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character). This was later relaxed, removing requirements for uppercase, lowercase, and number in the password.  The sign-in process uses `react-hook-form` for form handling, `next/navigation` for routing, `react-redux` for state management, and cookies for storing authentication tokens. Successful login redirects users based on their role (student or tutor) and profile completion status.  The sign-in process also incorporates social login buttons (Google, Apple, Facebook).  The final change added visual enhancement to the Sign Up button.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* **React Components and Libraries:**  Both files heavily utilize React components and libraries, such as `react-hook-form`, `zod` for validation, `react-redux` for state management, and various UI components.
* **Responsive Design:**  Extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes suggests a focus on responsive design across various screen sizes.
* **Error Handling:** The `page.js` file demonstrates thorough error handling using `try...catch` blocks and `toast` notifications.  `Rating.jsx` also handles loading and error states.
* **Progressive Enhancements:** The `Rating.jsx` file evolved incrementally, with initial commented-out code gradually being replaced with functional code.  Similar incremental adjustments also occurred on the `page.js` file regarding password validation.


The frequent commenting and uncommenting in `Rating.jsx` suggests an iterative development process, possibly involving experimentation and refinement of the component's functionality and design.  The modifications in `page.js` reflect adjustments to security policies and UI improvements.
