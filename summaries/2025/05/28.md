# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 1:21:50 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions of `FAQHomework.js` and one commented-out `Rating.jsx` component.  The `FAQHomework.js` file underwent several minor updates between 12:50 PM and 12:57 PM on May 28, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `renderTextWithLinks` function. Initially, this function directly manipulated the `parts` array resulting from a string split. Later revisions added null checks using `processedText?.split` and `Array.isArray(parts)` to ensure robustness when handling potential null or undefined values for `processedText` or if the split operation didn't return an array.  The core functionality – fetching and displaying FAQs with links – remained consistent throughout.  The changes to `renderTextWithLinks` improved the component's ability to handle unexpected input, preventing potential errors.  The `Rating.jsx` component appears to be a commented-out section of the log and does not contain any relevant code changes.


## 2:21:54 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to a React component (`Rating.jsx`) responsible for displaying tutor reviews and a React page (`page.js`) for user sign-in.

**`Rating.jsx` Updates:**

The `Rating.jsx` file underwent several iterations between 1:25 PM and 2:18 PM on May 28, 2025.  The major change was the renaming of the component from `Rating` to `ManageRating`.  Initially, the code was heavily commented out.  The uncommented version progressively revealed a component that displays tutor ratings using star icons (`FaStar`, `FaRegStar`, `FaStarHalfAlt` from `react-icons/fa`), rating bars, and a section for displaying reviews. The reviews are sortable ("Newest First", "Oldest First", "Highest Rating", "Lowest Rating").  The component also handles loading and error states.  The final version is a fully functional rating component with visual improvements and refined styling using tailwind CSS.


**`page.js` Updates:**

The `page.js` file, related to user sign-in, was modified between 2:02 PM and 2:04 PM on May 28, 2025. The primary change involved refining the password validation schema (`loginSchema`) using zod.  Initially, the schema enforced a strong password policy (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character). This was later relaxed, removing requirements for uppercase, lowercase, and number in the password.  The sign-in process uses `react-hook-form` for form handling, `next/navigation` for routing, `react-redux` for state management, and cookies for storing authentication tokens. Successful login redirects users based on their role (student or tutor) and profile completion status.  The sign-in process also incorporates social login buttons (Google, Apple, Facebook).  The final change added visual enhancement to the Sign Up button.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* **React Components and Libraries:**  Both files heavily utilize React components and libraries, such as `react-hook-form`, `zod` for validation, `react-redux` for state management, and various UI components.
* **Responsive Design:**  Extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes suggests a focus on responsive design across various screen sizes.
* **Error Handling:** The `page.js` file demonstrates thorough error handling using `try...catch` blocks and `toast` notifications.  `Rating.jsx` also handles loading and error states.
* **Progressive Enhancements:** The `Rating.jsx` file evolved incrementally, with initial commented-out code gradually being replaced with functional code.  Similar incremental adjustments also occurred on the `page.js` file regarding password validation.


The frequent commenting and uncommenting in `Rating.jsx` suggests an iterative development process, possibly involving experimentation and refinement of the component's functionality and design.  The modifications in `page.js` reflect adjustments to security policies and UI improvements.


## 3:21:49 PM
The code represents a React component `ManageRating` displaying tutor reviews.  The major update on May 28th, 2025, at 3:17:46 PM involved refactoring the component to reuse the `renderStars` function for displaying star ratings.  The component fetches and displays review data, including sorting options ("Newest First," "Oldest First," "Highest Rating," "Lowest Rating").  It shows a summary of ratings with a bar chart visualization and displays a limited number of reviews initially, with an option to view all reviews.  The component handles loading and error states and uses several React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).  The commented-out code suggests previous iterations potentially utilizing different component libraries (`@mantine/core`, `react-spinners`, `js-cookie`) and an axios instance for API calls. The current version renders star ratings using react-icons and lucide-react.  The styling is extensive, utilizing Tailwind CSS for responsive design.


## 6:07:59 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components related to tutor reviews. The main focus is on `ReviewReplyPopup.js`, `EditReplyPopup.js`, and `DeleteReviewPopup.js`,  with numerous UI adjustments occurring between 3:56 PM and 4:13 PM.  These changes primarily involve styling modifications using Tailwind CSS classes, altering element dimensions (`w-`, `h-`, `rounded-`),  and adjusting the layout with `flex` and `gap` classes.  There are also minor structural changes to the component layout, moving elements within parent containers.  After 4:13 PM, `ReviewReplyPopup.js`  remains largely unchanged while the focus shifts to improving the UI of `DeleteReviewPopup.js`  between 4:17 PM and 5:33 PM, again using primarily Tailwind CSS styling.  Significant changes to `Rating.jsx` begin around 5:37 PM, transforming it from a simpler rating display to a more comprehensive review management section. This involves adding a sorting mechanism for reviews,  a section for displaying a rating breakdown (bar charts), subject tags, and a cleaner overall layout. The `page.jsx` file is updated between 5:50 PM and 5:57 PM to include an image element and adjusts positioning of this image element.  The changes to `Rating.jsx`  around 6:00 PM reflect a continuous refinement of the UI, particularly the visual presentation of the average rating and the layout of the rating summary and breakdown sections, with updates to text size and font weight.  Finally, the styling of subject tags is adjusted around 6:07 PM.  Throughout the log, the `renderStars` function remains consistent, suggesting a stable component for displaying star ratings.
