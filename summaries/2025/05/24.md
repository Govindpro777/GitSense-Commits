# Activity Summary for 5/24/2025

## 10:05:28 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `Accordion.js` and `FAQHomework.js`.

`Accordion.js` underwent three modifications between 6:47:04 PM and 6:48:05 PM on May 23, 2025.  These changes all involved alterations to the `md:w` class within the inner `div` of the accordion component. Specifically, the width of the content area was adjusted, increasing from `calc((822/1440)*100vw)` to `calc((900/1440)*100vw)` and finally to `calc((1000/1440)*100vw)`. This suggests iterative adjustments to the layout and responsiveness of the accordion component.  The rest of the component's code remained consistent across these revisions.

`FAQHomework.js` was updated twice, at 6:54:36 PM and 6:55:16 PM on May 23, 2025.  The initial version shows commented-out code suggesting a previous implementation that directly rendered FAQ data. The final version fetches FAQ data asynchronously using `axiosInstance.get('/api/faqs/homework')` and dynamically renders it using an Accordion component.  The key change between the two versions is the addition of functionality to fetch FAQ data from an API, handle loading states, and display errors.  Furthermore,  the component now processes the answers to include links dynamically generated from `faq.links`. The second revision added the `font-medium` class to the dynamically created links within the accordion answers.
