# Activity Summary for 5/24/2025

## 10:05:28 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `Accordion.js` and `FAQHomework.js`.

`Accordion.js` underwent three modifications between 6:47:04 PM and 6:48:05 PM on May 23, 2025.  These changes all involved alterations to the `md:w` class within the inner `div` of the accordion component. Specifically, the width of the content area was adjusted, increasing from `calc((822/1440)*100vw)` to `calc((900/1440)*100vw)` and finally to `calc((1000/1440)*100vw)`. This suggests iterative adjustments to the layout and responsiveness of the accordion component.  The rest of the component's code remained consistent across these revisions.

`FAQHomework.js` was updated twice, at 6:54:36 PM and 6:55:16 PM on May 23, 2025.  The initial version shows commented-out code suggesting a previous implementation that directly rendered FAQ data. The final version fetches FAQ data asynchronously using `axiosInstance.get('/api/faqs/homework')` and dynamically renders it using an Accordion component.  The key change between the two versions is the addition of functionality to fetch FAQ data from an API, handle loading states, and display errors.  Furthermore,  the component now processes the answers to include links dynamically generated from `faq.links`. The second revision added the `font-medium` class to the dynamically created links within the accordion answers.


## 11:09:03 AM
The log shows extensive changes across frontend and backend components of an LMS system between 10:09 AM and 11:06 AM on May 24, 2025.

**LMS_backend/index.js (5/24/2025, 10:09:53 AM):** This file, the backend entry point, underwent a major revision.  Initially, many routes were directly imported and used (`app.use(...)`).  The update implements lazy loading of routes using `lazyLoadRoute`, significantly improving the initial load time of the backend.  All previously directly imported routes are now lazy-loaded, including `/api/v1/*` routes for teachers, students, courses, feedback, queries, notifications, contact us, branches, admin, teacher ratings, assignment submissions, and a new `/api/v1/admission` route. The CORS configuration was updated to specify allowed origins, enabling cross-origin requests from specific frontend addresses.  Session management using `express-session` and `connect-mongo` was significantly enhanced, improving security by using HTTPS-only cookies in production.  A new error handling middleware was added.

**LMS_backend/routes/teachersApplicationRoutes.js (5/24/2025, 10:10:05 AM):**  This route file, handling teacher applications, was updated. New endpoints were added for deleting applications (`router.delete`) and retrieving applications by ID (`router.get`).  An upload middleware (`uploadMiddleware`) was integrated into the `newApplication` POST route, likely for handling file uploads with application submissions.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/demo/DemoCards.js (Multiple Timestamps):** This frontend component, displaying demo courses, was heavily modified throughout the log. The initial code was fully commented out.  The final version likely involved significant changes to data fetching, filtering, and display, though the exact changes are not reflected in the final commented-out code.  There's a recurring pattern of commenting out and uncommenting large sections, suggesting iterative development and potential experimentation.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/DemoStudentRegistration.js (Multiple Timestamps):** This component, responsible for demo student registration, went through multiple revisions.  Again, the final version is entirely commented out but contained a React component for user registration, including form validation and asynchronous submission to the backend. The changes likely improved the user experience and error handling.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/BookingSuccessModal.jsx (Two Timestamps):** A minor change was made to this component showing a successful booking confirmation. The `inset-0` class was added to the main div, which affects how the modal covers the entire screen.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/TeacherCard.jsx (Three Timestamps):** This component shows teacher profiles.  Several fields were selectively commented out (`/* ... */`), specifically the `alternativeNumber`, `salary` and `religion` fields. This suggests a dynamic display of teacher information, potentially controlled by configuration or user permissions.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/TimeSlotSelector.jsx (Multiple Timestamps):**  This component allows users to select time slots for demo bookings.  It underwent significant refactoring, transitioning from a simpler structure to a more complex implementation that handles grouped slots by date and allows expansion/collapse of date groups, improving usability.  The final version enhances the presentation of time slots, adding clearer status indicators (Booked/Selected) and a loading state.  

The overall pattern indicates a focused effort on enhancing the user interface and experience of the demo booking and registration, along with backend changes designed to support these improvements. The commented-out code in multiple frontend files suggests a highly iterative development process.
