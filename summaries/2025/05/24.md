# Activity Summary for 5/24/2025

## 10:05:28 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `Accordion.js` and `FAQHomework.js`.

`Accordion.js` underwent three modifications between 6:47:04 PM and 6:48:05 PM on May 23, 2025.  These changes all involved alterations to the `md:w` class within the inner `div` of the accordion component. Specifically, the width of the content area was adjusted, increasing from `calc((822/1440)*100vw)` to `calc((900/1440)*100vw)` and finally to `calc((1000/1440)*100vw)`. This suggests iterative adjustments to the layout and responsiveness of the accordion component.  The rest of the component's code remained consistent across these revisions.

`FAQHomework.js` was updated twice, at 6:54:36 PM and 6:55:16 PM on May 23, 2025.  The initial version shows commented-out code suggesting a previous implementation that directly rendered FAQ data. The final version fetches FAQ data asynchronously using `axiosInstance.get('/api/faqs/homework')` and dynamically renders it using an Accordion component.  The key change between the two versions is the addition of functionality to fetch FAQ data from an API, handle loading states, and display errors.  Furthermore,  the component now processes the answers to include links dynamically generated from `faq.links`. The second revision added the `font-medium` class to the dynamically created links within the accordion answers.


## 11:09:03 AM
The log shows extensive changes across frontend and backend components of an LMS system between 10:09 AM and 11:06 AM on May 24, 2025.

**LMS_backend/index.js (5/24/2025, 10:09:53 AM):** This file, the backend entry point, underwent a major revision.  Initially, many routes were directly imported and used (`app.use(...)`).  The update implements lazy loading of routes using `lazyLoadRoute`, significantly improving the initial load time of the backend.  All previously directly imported routes are now lazy-loaded, including `/api/v1/*` routes for teachers, students, courses, feedback, queries, notifications, contact us, branches, admin, teacher ratings, assignment submissions, and a new `/api/v1/admission` route. The CORS configuration was updated to specify allowed origins, enabling cross-origin requests from specific frontend addresses.  Session management using `express-session` and `connect-mongo` was significantly enhanced, improving security by using HTTPS-only cookies in production.  A new error handling middleware was added.

**LMS_backend/routes/teachersApplicationRoutes.js (5/24/2025, 10:10:05 AM):**  This route file, handling teacher applications, was updated. New endpoints were added for deleting applications (`router.delete`) and retrieving applications by ID (`router.get`).  An upload middleware (`uploadMiddleware`) was integrated into the `newApplication` POST route, likely for handling file uploads with application submissions.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/demo/DemoCards.js (Multiple Timestamps):** This frontend component, displaying demo courses, was heavily modified throughout the log. The initial code was fully commented out.  The final version likely involved significant changes to data fetching, filtering, and display, though the exact changes are not reflected in the final commented-out code.  There's a recurring pattern of commenting out and uncommenting large sections, suggesting iterative development and potential experimentation.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/DemoStudentRegistration.js (Multiple Timestamps):** This component, responsible for demo student registration, went through multiple revisions.  Again, the final version is entirely commented out but contained a React component for user registration, including form validation and asynchronous submission to the backend. The changes likely improved the user experience and error handling.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/BookingSuccessModal.jsx (Two Timestamps):** A minor change was made to this component showing a successful booking confirmation. The `inset-0` class was added to the main div, which affects how the modal covers the entire screen.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/TeacherCard.jsx (Three Timestamps):** This component shows teacher profiles.  Several fields were selectively commented out (`/* ... */`), specifically the `alternativeNumber`, `salary` and `religion` fields. This suggests a dynamic display of teacher information, potentially controlled by configuration or user permissions.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/TimeSlotSelector.jsx (Multiple Timestamps):**  This component allows users to select time slots for demo bookings.  It underwent significant refactoring, transitioning from a simpler structure to a more complex implementation that handles grouped slots by date and allows expansion/collapse of date groups, improving usability.  The final version enhances the presentation of time slots, adding clearer status indicators (Booked/Selected) and a loading state.  

The overall pattern indicates a focused effort on enhancing the user interface and experience of the demo booking and registration, along with backend changes designed to support these improvements. The commented-out code in multiple frontend files suggests a highly iterative development process.


## 1:29:33 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two React component files: `InviteTutors.js` and `CreateNewProject.js`.  There were no changes made to `ProjectDetails.js` after the initial timestamp.


`InviteTutors.js` underwent several updates between 12:50 PM and 12:58 PM, with no discernible changes in functionality across these commits. The code is a React component that fetches and displays a list of tutors based on a subject ID, retrieved either from props or cookies.  Tutors can be sorted by different criteria (relevance, price, date) and filtered by search text.  The component extensively uses cookies to store and retrieve data, particularly subject information and form data under the "project_form_data" key.  The use of mock tutor data (`mockTutors`) suggests development-oriented error handling.


`CreateNewProject.js` shows a series of changes between 12:59 PM and 1:07 PM.  This React component handles the creation and editing of new projects.  It uses cookies (`project_form_data`) to persist form data across sessions.  The component features:

*   Extensive state management for project details (title, content, type, subject, deadline, etc.).
*   File upload functionality using `axiosInstance` to upload files (`/api/files/upload/${userId}?uploadType=PROJECT`) and store the response.
*   Integration with `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/dates` for UI components.
*   Fetching project details for edit mode using `/api/homework/${homeworkId}`.
*   Subject categories are fetched from localStorage.  The component dynamically updates the list of available subjects based on the selected category.

The frequent updates to `CreateNewProject.js` may indicate iterative development and debugging.  A recurring theme is extensive use of cookies for data persistence and error handling through `toast` notifications.  Both components leverage `axiosInstance` for API calls and `useAuth` hook for authentication.


## 2:29:29 PM
The log shows multiple updates to React components within a frontend application, likely for creating and managing homework/project assignments.  The changes span several files and focus heavily on API interactions, form handling, and user interface elements.

`WelcomePage.js` (multiple timestamps): This component is a modal for creating new projects.  Significant updates include adding functionalities for fetching budget suggestions (`fetchBudgetSuggestion` function) based on project type, subject, word count, and user ID, handling file uploads (`uploadFile` function) via an API endpoint `/api/files/upload`, and creating projects (`handleCreateProject` function) by sending a payload containing project details to `/api/homework/create`.  The component uses cookies and local storage extensively to manage user state and project data.  Error handling using `toast` notifications is consistent throughout.  The final update at 2:02:24 PM likely represents a minor refinement or bug fix.

`ProjectDetails.js` (multiple timestamps):  This component displays and allows editing of existing project details. The initial version (1:54:42 PM) focuses on fetching project details using `fetchProjectDetails` via `/api/homework/{homeworkId}`, handling file uploads (similar to `WelcomePage.js`), and showing a loading indicator. The subsequent update (1:55:12 PM) appears to be identical to the prior version, indicating a possible accidental duplicate entry or a failed attempt at a change.  The component also utilizes cookies and local storage for subject categories and user authentication.


`CreateNewProject.js` (multiple timestamps):  This component handles creating new projects and editing existing ones.  It includes extensive use of cookies (`COOKIE_KEY = "project_form_data"`) to manage form state and persist data across sessions and page loads.  The component fetches project details in edit mode (`fetchProjectDetails`),  supports file uploads (`uploadFile`), and integrates with APIs `/api/homework/{homeworkId}` for fetching and updating projects.  The update at 1:56:41 PM shows further enhancements and refinements to cookie handling and error checks, which are not explicitly visible in the difference between the two timestamps.  The component uses `useSearchParams` from `next/navigation` for handling edit mode parameters.  There's significant logic dedicated to managing subject categories and subjects, reflecting a hierarchical structure.


Recurring patterns include:

*   Extensive use of `axiosInstance` for API calls.
*   Consistent use of `toast` notifications for feedback.
*   Reliance on cookies and local storage for data persistence and state management.
*   Similar file upload mechanisms across components.
*   Functions for fetching and handling budget suggestions.


The timestamps suggest a period of intense development concentrated within a short timeframe on May 24, 2025.


## 3:06:04 PM
The log shows code changes across frontend and backend components of an LMS system on May 24, 2025.

**LMS_backend/index.js (5/24/2025, 2:16:29 PM):** This file, the backend entry point, underwent a significant update.  Initially, it imported and used numerous route files individually. The revision employs a `lazyLoadRoute` utility, dynamically importing routes only when needed, improving initial load time.  The CORS middleware was modified to specify allowed origins,  likely reflecting a shift towards a production environment.  Session management with `express-session` and `connect-mongo` for persistent sessions is configured, with `secure` and `sameSite` cookie settings adjusted based on the environment (`process.env.NODE_ENV`).  Several commented-out routes suggest a potential refactoring or planned features.  The update also included the addition of a cron job (`updateAssignmentType.js`).


**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/TeacherCard.js (5/24/2025, 2:18:45 PM & 5/24/2025, 2:19:46 PM):**  This component, displaying teacher information, was modified.  The changes primarily involved the intro video functionality. The initial version displayed the video directly within the card. The second version removed the embedded video player and instead implemented a clickable "Watch Intro Video" link, opening the video in a new tab.  Minor formatting adjustments and the removal of commented-out code are also present between the two updates.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/BookingPanel.js (5/24/2025, 2:27:30 PM & 5/24/2025, 2:51:44 PM):** The BookingPanel component saw revisions. The most notable change was removing the `selectedDate` prop and related functionality in the second update, simplifying the date handling.  The core booking logic and UI components remained the same; however, the way it is now handling dates might have been moved elsewhere.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/TimeSlotSelector.js (5/24/2025, 2:27:50 PM, 5/24/2025, 2:28:57 PM, 5/24/2025, 2:34:09 PM, 5/24/2025, 2:43:27 PM, 5/24/2025, 2:43:54 PM, 5/24/2025, 2:44:12 PM, 5/24/2025, 2:53:32 PM):** This component, responsible for time slot selection, underwent multiple iterations.  Early versions lacked proper handling of the API response structure for available time slots, leading to multiple updates correcting this issue. The API response was improved to handle the data correctly. Initially, the component included a date selector; this was removed in later commits. The major change is that the slots are grouped by date, making the UI cleaner and more user-friendly. The loading and error states were also improved to provide better feedback.


**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/BookingDemo.js (5/24/2025, 2:46:49 PM & 5/24/2025, 2:52:27 PM):** The main booking demo page received a significant update.  The most important addition was the integration of a login modal for existing users which triggers if an email is already registered.  This enhances the user experience by streamlining the flow for registered users. The code also incorporates better error handling, specifically around email conflicts, and provides more informative toast messages.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/DemoLogin.js (5/24/2025, 2:53:05 PM):** This newly added component handles the login functionality for existing users. It handles validation, error messaging, and redirects to the appropriate handler after successful login.  The initial email field is pre-populated if existingEmail is passed as a prop.


**Recurring Elements:** The frontend code consistently uses Tailwind CSS for styling, Lucide React for icons, and Next.js features like `useRouter` and `useSearchParams`.  Error handling with `try...catch` blocks and toast notifications is a common pattern in both frontend and backend code.


The overall pattern suggests a continuous development process, with multiple iterations focusing on refining the user interface and handling edge cases, especially related to time slot availability and user registration/login. The changes reflect a move from development to a more production-ready version of the application.


## 3:29:25 PM
The `TutorCard.jsx` component was updated on May 24, 2025, at 3:24:14 PM.  The update involved significant changes to the component's rendering and functionality. Key changes include:

* **Improved UI:**  The visual presentation of tutor cards was enhanced with better styling, responsive design using media queries (`sm`, `md`, `2xl`), and the use of the `@mantine/core` Image component for better image handling.  The component now includes conditional rendering for different screen sizes, particularly for the tutor's description.

* **Enhanced Favorite Functionality:** The heart icon now correctly handles favorite actions, integrating with `react-redux` and utilizing `handleHeartClick` for adding/removing favorites and redirecting to the sign-in page if the user is not authenticated.

* **Availability Display:**  A more user-friendly display for tutor availability was implemented, showing the next available slot using `formatDateTime` or a "No available slots" message.  The styling and layout of this section were improved for responsiveness.

* **Profile Tag System:** A configurable `profileTagConfig` object was introduced, allowing for flexible display of tutor profile tags (Ambassador, Super Tutor, etc.) with different icons and colors.  This system uses conditional rendering to correctly display the assigned tag.

* **Routing & Navigation:**  The component utilizes `next/navigation`'s `useRouter` for navigation to tutor booking pages. The booking link now dynamically includes the subject.

* **Improved Error Handling and Fallbacks:**  The component includes fallback images for tutor avatars using `ui-avatars` and gracefully handles cases where data might be missing.

* **Use of Utility Functions:** The code leverages custom utility functions like `cn` (likely for className concatenation), `useScreenSize`, and `getFirstAvailableSlot` to improve code organization and readability.


The overall update reflects a significant improvement in the component's presentation, functionality, and maintainability. The use of consistent styling and responsive design patterns suggests a focus on user experience and cross-device compatibility.


## 5:29:25 PM
The log shows three commits related to `CreateNewProject.js` on May 24, 2025.  The first commit at 5:27:17 PM introduces a React component for creating new projects.  This component handles various project details including title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type, specific writer selection, word count, and file uploads.  It uses cookies (`js-cookie`) to persist form data, `axios` for API calls, and `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/dates` for UI components.  The component also fetches and displays subject categories, allowing users to select a subject within a category.  It manages edit mode functionality, retrieving existing project data via API calls based on a provided `homeworkId` from URL parameters.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to managing form data persistence in cookies, including serialization and deserialization.

The second and third commits, at 5:28:32 PM and 5:28:52 PM respectively, completely comment out the entire code from the previous commit.  This suggests a potential rollback or temporary removal of the component, possibly due to debugging or refactoring.  No new code is added in these latter two commits.  The pattern indicates an iterative development process with potential issues requiring a temporary reversion.
