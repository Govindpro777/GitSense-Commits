# Activity Summary for 5/9/2025

## 4:33:51 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `UploadFiles.js` component.  Initially (3:48:45 PM), the component displayed a static list of files and included UI elements for tab navigation, file sorting (desktop and mobile), and a filter modal.  The file-handling logic was limited to adding hardcoded sample files and a basic `handleRemoveFile` function.

A subsequent update (3:52:31 PM) added a `homeworkId` prop to the component, suggesting integration with a larger project context.  The core functionality of the component remained largely unchanged, with the addition of the `homeworkId` prop only impacting the logging.

Between 3:52:31 PM and 4:20:06 PM, the component code was completely commented out in several revisions, indicating a potential refactoring or temporary removal during development.

Finally, starting at 4:20:06 PM, the file's code began appearing again, initially as commented out code. The final version (4:29:26 PM)  reinstated the UI  but with significant changes:  The initial hardcoded file data was removed, replaced by fetching and displaying files from an external data source. The added imports `axiosInstance`, `toast`, `useAuth`, and `Cookies`  suggest that the  component now handles file uploads and possibly deletion, using API calls and authentication (`jwtToken` and `userId` are used to manage user authentication and file associations).  The component now manages loading and deletion states (`isLoading`, `isDeleting`, `showDeleteModal`, `fileToDelete`).  This final version is substantially different from the initial version, reflecting the addition of dynamic data fetching and file management features.  The changes are primarily centered around connecting to a backend service for file management (upload and potentially delete).  The UI, while largely preserved, is now driven by data fetched from a backend, instead of having hardcoded examples.


## 5:33:49 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `UploadFiles.js` on May 9th, 2025.  The code appears to be a React component for displaying and managing uploaded files.  There are no functional changes across the different commits; the code remains largely the same throughout the log. The timestamps indicate a period of active development and potential debugging or minor adjustments between approximately 4:34 PM and 5:15 PM.  The component uses `useState` for managing file lists, tabs ('All', 'Your Files', "Writer's File"), sorting, and a filter modal.  It also leverages `useRef` for managing the filter modal's focus and `useEffect` for handling clicks outside the modal to close it.  The UI is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes with different layouts for mobile and desktop devices. The file display includes file name, size, upload time, download and remove icons, and user information.  The repeated nature of the code suggests that the edits were minor adjustments or possibly related to formatting, rather than significant feature additions or bug fixes.
