# Activity Summary for 5/9/2025

## 4:33:51 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `UploadFiles.js` component.  Initially (3:48:45 PM), the component displayed a static list of files and included UI elements for tab navigation, file sorting (desktop and mobile), and a filter modal.  The file-handling logic was limited to adding hardcoded sample files and a basic `handleRemoveFile` function.

A subsequent update (3:52:31 PM) added a `homeworkId` prop to the component, suggesting integration with a larger project context.  The core functionality of the component remained largely unchanged, with the addition of the `homeworkId` prop only impacting the logging.

Between 3:52:31 PM and 4:20:06 PM, the component code was completely commented out in several revisions, indicating a potential refactoring or temporary removal during development.

Finally, starting at 4:20:06 PM, the file's code began appearing again, initially as commented out code. The final version (4:29:26 PM)  reinstated the UI  but with significant changes:  The initial hardcoded file data was removed, replaced by fetching and displaying files from an external data source. The added imports `axiosInstance`, `toast`, `useAuth`, and `Cookies`  suggest that the  component now handles file uploads and possibly deletion, using API calls and authentication (`jwtToken` and `userId` are used to manage user authentication and file associations).  The component now manages loading and deletion states (`isLoading`, `isDeleting`, `showDeleteModal`, `fileToDelete`).  This final version is substantially different from the initial version, reflecting the addition of dynamic data fetching and file management features.  The changes are primarily centered around connecting to a backend service for file management (upload and potentially delete).  The UI, while largely preserved, is now driven by data fetched from a backend, instead of having hardcoded examples.
