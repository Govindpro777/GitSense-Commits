## 9:20:19 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 20, 2025, at 11:00:38 PM.  The change involves the creation or update of `ChartContainer.jsx` within a React project. This component renders a card-like element containing a title (passed as a prop) and a child component (also passed as a prop),  styled using Tailwind CSS classes. The component's primary function is to provide a container for charts, indicated by the `h-52` class suggesting a fixed height of 52 units.


## 1:14:27 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `ClaimOffer.js` and `TheAuction.js` components in a React frontend application, and one commented-out `ActiveProject.js` component.  The changes span approximately 20 minutes.

**`ClaimOffer.js` Modifications:**

The `ClaimOffer.js` file underwent significant changes focusing on improving the user experience and integrating with a backend API.

* **Initial Versions (commented-out):**  Early versions contained a basic implementation with client-side validation for a 10-digit phone number and simulated API calls using `setTimeout`.

* **API Integration (5/21/2025, 12:25:06 PM onwards):** Subsequent commits introduced:
    *  Use of `axiosInstance` for API calls to `/api/homework/claim-offer`.
    *  JWT token and user ID retrieval using cookies and `useAuth` hook.  This suggests authentication is required.
    *  Country code selection (`+1` initially, then changed to `+91`, and finally a dropdown was implemented to select different country codes with flags).
    *  Error handling using `try...catch...finally` and `toast.success` or `toast.error` messages.
    *  The addition of `sonner` for toast notifications.

* **Country Code Dropdown (5/21/2025, 12:28:04 PM and 12:35:54 PM):**  A significant improvement was the addition of a country code dropdown using `useRef` and `useEffect` to handle outside clicks for closing it.  A list of country codes with flags was added, significantly enhancing internationalization support.  The phone number validation regex changed to accommodate various phone number lengths (`^\d{7,15}$`).

* **Default Country Code (5/21/2025, 12:29:18 PM and 12:32:37 PM, 12:36:08 PM):** The default country code was changed from `+1` to `+91` (India), suggesting a target audience shift.


**`TheAuction.js` Modifications:**

The `TheAuction.js` component was modified to fetch and display tutor statistics.

* **Initial Version (5/21/2025, 12:52:21 PM):**  The initial version was a static component showing a loading animation and placeholder data.

* **API Integration (5/21/2025, 12:58:00 PM onwards):**  Subsequent commits added:
    *  `homeworkId` prop to fetch data based on project ID.
    *  `useAuth` and `Cookies` for authentication token and user ID.
    *  `axiosInstance` to fetch `availableTutorsCount` from `/api/homework/order/available-tutors-stats` endpoint.
    *  Loading state management using `useState` to display "Loading..." until data is fetched.
    *  Error handling and `toast.error` messages.

* **Display of `availableTutorsCount` (5/21/2025, 12:58:00 PM, 1:02:20 PM, 1:02:51PM):**  There were revisions in how `availableTutorsCount` is displayed and integrated into the component's layout.


**`Auction.js` Modifications:**

The `Auction.js` component focuses on displaying the details of an auction related to a project.

* **API Calls (5/21/2025, 1:00:32 PM and 1:00:58 PM):** This component makes API calls to fetch project details (`/api/homework/${id}`) and tutor bids (`/api/bids/order/${id}`).  It uses similar authentication mechanisms as `ClaimOffer.js` and `TheAuction.js`.
* **Prop Change and Component Usage(5/21/2025, 1:00:58 PM):** The `TheAuction` component's prop changed from `id` to `homeworkId`.


**`ActiveProject.js`:**

This component was entirely commented out, suggesting it may be temporarily inactive or removed from the application.  The commented-out code shows a planned component for displaying a list of active projects with filtering and search capabilities, probably using a third-party component library (`@mantine/core`, `@mantine/dates`, etc.).


In summary, the code changes reflect a significant effort in integrating frontend components with a backend API, implementing robust error handling, and enhancing the user interface with interactive elements such as a country code dropdown.  A pattern of using `axiosInstance`, `useAuth`, and `Cookies` for API calls and authentication is consistently applied. The `TheAuction` componentâ€™s changes suggest a focus on providing real-time updates on the status of projects in an auction.


## 2:14:14 PM
The log shows three consecutive commits to `ActiveProject.js`  on May 21, 2025, between 1:35 PM and 1:38 PM.  All three commits contain identical code, suggesting that only the timestamp changed and no actual code modifications were made during these three commits. The component renders a section with responsive tabs for managing projects, including features like a sidebar toggle, a search input, and visual indicators for active tabs.  The code uses React, Next.js's `Image` component, and Mantine UI components for styling and date/time selection.  The project data is hardcoded within the component and includes several project types ('At the Auction', 'Drafts', 'Revision', 'In Process', 'Under Warranty').  The tabs dynamically update based on the `activeTab` state, and  `useEffect` hooks manage indicator positioning and smooth scrolling for the active tab.


## 3:14:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ActiveProject.js` and `ActiveCard.js` on May 21, 2025.  The majority of changes in `ActiveProject.js` involve commenting out the entire component, repeatedly. This suggests a possible process of experimentation or debugging, with the code being temporarily removed and then restored. There is no substantive change to the final `ActiveProject.js` content.

`ActiveCard.js` underwent a significant revision between 2:31:25 PM and 2:31:25 PM.  The initial version was fully commented out. The final version introduces:

*   Use of `useRouter` from `next/navigation` for navigation.
*   Introduction of `homeworkId` to allow navigation to a specific homework auction page.
*   Addition of a modal (`isUploadModalOpen`) for file uploads, likely using a component called `UploadFiles`.
*   Refactoring to handle different project types (`type`) and associated styling.

The timestamps show a rapid succession of changes, indicating iterative development and testing within a short timeframe.  The repeated commenting out of entire files in `ActiveProject.js` is a notable pattern, likely reflecting a debugging or refactoring strategy.  The `ActiveCard.js` revision is a substantial update, introducing new functionality and improving the component's overall structure.


## 3:42:28 PM
The log shows development activity on a Learning Management System (LMS) backend and frontend between 2:55 PM and 3:40 PM on May 21, 2025.

The backend (`index.js`) underwent a significant update at 2:55 PM.  Initially, many route imports were commented out. The updated version uses a `lazyLoadRoute` utility to dynamically import routes, adding support for  `time-slots`, `demo-bookings`, `demo-students`, and several other API endpoints (`/api/v1/*`). This change likely aims to improve load times by only importing necessary modules when needed.  The server uses `express.js`, `cors`, and `cookie-parser`.  A database connection is established using a function called `database()`.

The frontend (`src\app\bookdemo\page.js`) experienced two minor updates, at 3:37 PM and 3:40 PM, both seemingly involving only timestamp changes with no code alterations.  The component fetches and displays demo courses. Error handling and loading indicators are implemented.  At 3:40 PM, `DemoCards` was changed to `TutorSelection`, indicating a shift in the component's functionality to include teacher selection.

A new file, `src\app\bookdemo\TutorSelection.js`, was created and updated between 3:39 PM and 3:40 PM. This component handles teacher selection for demo booking, fetching course details, and managing the booking process. It includes features like user authentication checks, error handling, and a booking confirmation modal.  The component uses Next.js navigation and utilizes Lucide-React icons.

Overall, the changes reflect the development of a demo booking feature within the LMS. The backend refactoring improves efficiency, while the frontend enhancements create a more robust and user-friendly experience for selecting and booking demo classes with specific tutors.


## 4:42:29 PM
The log shows several React component updates related to a course booking system.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\lms\LMS_frontend\src\app\bookdemo\page.js` underwent multiple revisions between 3:43 PM and 4:13 PM on May 21, 2025.  Initially, it only included a ToastContainer.  The `TutorSelection` component was added later.  These changes suggest a progressive implementation of the booking flow.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\lms\LMS_frontend\src\app\demo\DemoCards.js`  was significantly updated between 4:07 PM and 4:12 PM on May 21, 2025.  This component displays course cards, incorporating features like image display, search term highlighting, pagination (6 items per page), and modals for viewing course details and booking confirmations.  The most noticeable change involved handling the booking process and teacher selection.  The component now directs users to a teacher selection page (`/book-demo`) after clicking the "Book Demo" button, based on user login status. Several helper functions were added to format teacher names, dates, and images.  Debugging statements related to teacher data were present throughout the development process of this component, eventually being removed.

`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\lms\LMS_frontend\src\app\book-demo\TutorSelection.js`  was created and then heavily modified between 4:12 PM and 4:38 PM on May 21, 2025. Initially it contained the complete component rendering course details, teacher selection, and booking logic.  There were multiple API calls involved (`/api/v1/demos/${courseId}` to fetch course details and `/api/v1/demos/book-seat` to book a demo). The component then went through a phase of being completely commented out before being reinstated in the final revision.  This suggests a possible temporary removal or debugging step. The component handles teacher selection, booking, and error states, displaying loading indicators and error messages appropriately.  It fetches teacher details dynamically and also handles cases where teacher details might only be available as IDs, requiring further fetching.

Overall, the changes show a structured development process with iterative updates to both course display and booking components. There is a clear evolution from a basic page layout to a fully functional course selection and booking system. The frequent commits and detailed error handling within the `TutorSelection` component suggest a thorough and methodical approach to development.


## 5:42:33 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to `DemoCards.js` and `TutorSelection.js` in a React-based frontend application, likely for an LMS (Learning Management System).  There are also changes to `BookingDemo.js` and `page.js` related to demo booking functionality.  The changes span several hours on May 21st, 2025.

**`DemoCards.js`:**  The file underwent numerous revisions, primarily focusing on enhancing the display of course cards.  Early revisions involved commenting out and uncommenting large sections of code, suggesting iterative development and testing.  The final version includes pagination for courses, improved search functionality (highlighting search terms within descriptions and categories), and the addition of a "View Course" modal.  Significant changes occurred between 4:56 PM and 5:09 PM, with the addition of pagination and modal functionality.  Recurring debugging code related to teacher data (checking for and logging the presence of teacher information) is present throughout many revisions.


**`TutorSelection.js`:** This component displays tutor selection for a given course. All revisions of this file are commented out, indicating that this component may have been replaced or is no longer in use in its original form.  The commented-out code suggests functionality to fetch course details, select a tutor, and handle the booking process, including error handling and a confirmation modal.

**`BookingDemo.js`:**  This file contains a major code refactor between 5:35 PM and 5:41 PM. The earlier versions used `useCourseStore` and `axiosInstance` for fetching data and handling booking API calls, which implemented a slot-based booking system, checking for booking conflicts. The later version implements a more comprehensive booking form, collecting student information directly, and handling temporary student IDs for guest users.  The change includes a transition to handling errors using `react-toastify`  for better user experience.

**`page.js`:** This file is a simple wrapper for the `TutorSelection` component and includes a ToastContainer for displaying notifications.  The changes made to it are minor and simply reflect the refactoring done on the `BookingDemo` component.


The overall pattern suggests a continuous improvement process, with frequent changes to refine the UI and functionality for course display and demo booking.  The use of React, Next.js, and external libraries like `lucide-react` and `react-toastify` indicates a modern frontend development approach.


## 7:17:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `ActiveProject.js` component between 6:20 PM and 6:23 PM on May 21, 2025, primarily focused on refining its functionality and adding a Welcome Modal.  A `WelcomeModal.js` component was also created (timestamp 6:24:05 PM). The `ActiveProject.js` component fetches and displays active projects, using `axiosInstance` to interact with `/api/homework/student` and `/api/homework/student/status` endpoints.  Data transformation involves formatting dates, calculating price ranges from bids, and mapping API statuses ('CREATED', 'BIDDING', etc.) to UI statuses ('Drafts', 'At the Auction', etc.).  The component includes pagination and fuzzy search capabilities.  Subject data is fetched from `/api/homework/order/subjects`.  There's also error handling using `toast.error`.  The changes between 6:20 PM and 6:23 PM involved adding the `WelcomeModal` import and a corresponding useEffect hook to show the modal based on a cookie named `projectDescription`.

Between 6:23 PM and 7:13 PM, the `ClaimOffer.js` component underwent significant revision.  Initially, it used a simple input field for phone numbers.  The later versions replaced this with `react-phone-number-input`, improving phone number input and validation. The core functionality remained the same: making a POST request to `/api/homework/claim-offer` to claim an offer after validation. The  `jwtToken` and `userId` are retrieved for authentication.

The `ActiveCard.js` component (updated at 6:42:19 PM) displays individual project cards, dynamically styling based on project type.  It includes navigation to auction pages (`/homework/auction/{homeworkId}`) and a modal for file uploads.

Finally, the `myorders/page.jsx` file (updated at 6:42:51 PM) renders navigation components (`LandingNavbar`, `CommunityNavbar`, `MobileNavBar`) and the `ProjectWrapper` component, adapting the UI based on authentication status.


## 8:17:16 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the frontend code of the Expert Buddy application.  The most significant changes revolve around the authentication (`src\app\(auth)\signin\page.js`) and homework order (`src\app\homework\myorders\page.jsx`) pages, and the `BidTutorList` component.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\(auth)\signin\page.js`**: This file underwent several revisions between 7:37 PM and 7:49 PM.  The core functionality is a user login page with email/password and social login options.  Key updates include:

* **7:37 PM:** Initial version of the sign-in page.  It features email and password input fields with validation using Zod, handling of login via Redux, and conditional redirection based on user role (student or tutor) and profile completion status.  The redirection logic checks for a "projectDescription" cookie to determine if the user should be redirected to their homework orders after successful login. This version includes commented-out code hinting at previous redirect logic.

* **7:41 PM & 7:42 PM:**  Minor revisions were made to this file, likely bug fixes or minor UI adjustments. The structure of the code remains largely the same.

* **7:49 PM:** A substantial change adds social login buttons (Google, Apple, Facebook) at the bottom of the login form. The commented-out redirection logic from the initial version has been removed, simplifying the post-login redirect flow. The significant change is in the post-login redirecting logic, which now directly goes to the `/homework/myorders` page if a `projectDescription` cookie is set. The overall structure of the page and the login logic remain consistent across these revisions.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\myorders\page.jsx`**: This file was updated at 7:38 PM.  The code displays a navbar (conditional based on authentication status) and a `ProjectWrapper` component. The navbar changes based on whether the user is authenticated or not, displaying either a community or landing navbar accordingly. This suggests a transition between different views depending on authentication state.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\BidTutorList.js`**: Updated at 7:39 PM. This component fetches and displays a list of tutor bids for a given homework ID. It includes pagination, sorting options ("Most Relevant," "Dates," "Rating: Highest," "Price: Low to High," "Price: High to Low"), and error handling. It uses `axiosInstance` for API calls and utilizes cookies and Redux state for authentication information.  The addition of error handling and a more robust sorting mechanism are key improvements observed in this version.  A `memo` function is used to optimize performance, preventing re-renders if props haven't changed.


The recurring elements throughout the code are extensive use of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), Redux for state management, Axios for API calls, and Cookies for storing user information (JWT token and user ID).  The consistent use of styled-components and a similar design structure throughout indicates a unified design system.  The use of AbortController in multiple asynchronous functions shows a commitment to preventing race conditions.
