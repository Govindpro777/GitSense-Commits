# Activity Summary for 5/21/2025

## 9:20:19 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 20, 2025, at 11:00:38 PM.  The change involves the creation or update of `ChartContainer.jsx` within a React project. This component renders a card-like element containing a title (passed as a prop) and a child component (also passed as a prop),  styled using Tailwind CSS classes. The component's primary function is to provide a container for charts, indicated by the `h-52` class suggesting a fixed height of 52 units.


## 1:14:27 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `ClaimOffer.js` and `TheAuction.js` components in a React frontend application, and one commented-out `ActiveProject.js` component.  The changes span approximately 20 minutes.

**`ClaimOffer.js` Modifications:**

The `ClaimOffer.js` file underwent significant changes focusing on improving the user experience and integrating with a backend API.

* **Initial Versions (commented-out):**  Early versions contained a basic implementation with client-side validation for a 10-digit phone number and simulated API calls using `setTimeout`.

* **API Integration (5/21/2025, 12:25:06 PM onwards):** Subsequent commits introduced:
    *  Use of `axiosInstance` for API calls to `/api/homework/claim-offer`.
    *  JWT token and user ID retrieval using cookies and `useAuth` hook.  This suggests authentication is required.
    *  Country code selection (`+1` initially, then changed to `+91`, and finally a dropdown was implemented to select different country codes with flags).
    *  Error handling using `try...catch...finally` and `toast.success` or `toast.error` messages.
    *  The addition of `sonner` for toast notifications.

* **Country Code Dropdown (5/21/2025, 12:28:04 PM and 12:35:54 PM):**  A significant improvement was the addition of a country code dropdown using `useRef` and `useEffect` to handle outside clicks for closing it.  A list of country codes with flags was added, significantly enhancing internationalization support.  The phone number validation regex changed to accommodate various phone number lengths (`^\d{7,15}$`).

* **Default Country Code (5/21/2025, 12:29:18 PM and 12:32:37 PM, 12:36:08 PM):** The default country code was changed from `+1` to `+91` (India), suggesting a target audience shift.


**`TheAuction.js` Modifications:**

The `TheAuction.js` component was modified to fetch and display tutor statistics.

* **Initial Version (5/21/2025, 12:52:21 PM):**  The initial version was a static component showing a loading animation and placeholder data.

* **API Integration (5/21/2025, 12:58:00 PM onwards):**  Subsequent commits added:
    *  `homeworkId` prop to fetch data based on project ID.
    *  `useAuth` and `Cookies` for authentication token and user ID.
    *  `axiosInstance` to fetch `availableTutorsCount` from `/api/homework/order/available-tutors-stats` endpoint.
    *  Loading state management using `useState` to display "Loading..." until data is fetched.
    *  Error handling and `toast.error` messages.

* **Display of `availableTutorsCount` (5/21/2025, 12:58:00 PM, 1:02:20 PM, 1:02:51PM):**  There were revisions in how `availableTutorsCount` is displayed and integrated into the component's layout.


**`Auction.js` Modifications:**

The `Auction.js` component focuses on displaying the details of an auction related to a project.

* **API Calls (5/21/2025, 1:00:32 PM and 1:00:58 PM):** This component makes API calls to fetch project details (`/api/homework/${id}`) and tutor bids (`/api/bids/order/${id}`).  It uses similar authentication mechanisms as `ClaimOffer.js` and `TheAuction.js`.
* **Prop Change and Component Usage(5/21/2025, 1:00:58 PM):** The `TheAuction` component's prop changed from `id` to `homeworkId`.


**`ActiveProject.js`:**

This component was entirely commented out, suggesting it may be temporarily inactive or removed from the application.  The commented-out code shows a planned component for displaying a list of active projects with filtering and search capabilities, probably using a third-party component library (`@mantine/core`, `@mantine/dates`, etc.).


In summary, the code changes reflect a significant effort in integrating frontend components with a backend API, implementing robust error handling, and enhancing the user interface with interactive elements such as a country code dropdown.  A pattern of using `axiosInstance`, `useAuth`, and `Cookies` for API calls and authentication is consistently applied. The `TheAuction` componentâ€™s changes suggest a focus on providing real-time updates on the status of projects in an auction.


## 2:14:14 PM
The log shows three consecutive commits to `ActiveProject.js`  on May 21, 2025, between 1:35 PM and 1:38 PM.  All three commits contain identical code, suggesting that only the timestamp changed and no actual code modifications were made during these three commits. The component renders a section with responsive tabs for managing projects, including features like a sidebar toggle, a search input, and visual indicators for active tabs.  The code uses React, Next.js's `Image` component, and Mantine UI components for styling and date/time selection.  The project data is hardcoded within the component and includes several project types ('At the Auction', 'Drafts', 'Revision', 'In Process', 'Under Warranty').  The tabs dynamically update based on the `activeTab` state, and  `useEffect` hooks manage indicator positioning and smooth scrolling for the active tab.


## 3:14:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ActiveProject.js` and `ActiveCard.js` on May 21, 2025.  The majority of changes in `ActiveProject.js` involve commenting out the entire component, repeatedly. This suggests a possible process of experimentation or debugging, with the code being temporarily removed and then restored. There is no substantive change to the final `ActiveProject.js` content.

`ActiveCard.js` underwent a significant revision between 2:31:25 PM and 2:31:25 PM.  The initial version was fully commented out. The final version introduces:

*   Use of `useRouter` from `next/navigation` for navigation.
*   Introduction of `homeworkId` to allow navigation to a specific homework auction page.
*   Addition of a modal (`isUploadModalOpen`) for file uploads, likely using a component called `UploadFiles`.
*   Refactoring to handle different project types (`type`) and associated styling.

The timestamps show a rapid succession of changes, indicating iterative development and testing within a short timeframe.  The repeated commenting out of entire files in `ActiveProject.js` is a notable pattern, likely reflecting a debugging or refactoring strategy.  The `ActiveCard.js` revision is a substantial update, introducing new functionality and improving the component's overall structure.
