# Activity Summary for 5/21/2025

## 9:20:19 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 20, 2025, at 11:00:38 PM.  The change involves the creation or update of `ChartContainer.jsx` within a React project. This component renders a card-like element containing a title (passed as a prop) and a child component (also passed as a prop),  styled using Tailwind CSS classes. The component's primary function is to provide a container for charts, indicated by the `h-52` class suggesting a fixed height of 52 units.


## 1:14:27 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `ClaimOffer.js` and `TheAuction.js` components in a React frontend application, and one commented-out `ActiveProject.js` component.  The changes span approximately 20 minutes.

**`ClaimOffer.js` Modifications:**

The `ClaimOffer.js` file underwent significant changes focusing on improving the user experience and integrating with a backend API.

* **Initial Versions (commented-out):**  Early versions contained a basic implementation with client-side validation for a 10-digit phone number and simulated API calls using `setTimeout`.

* **API Integration (5/21/2025, 12:25:06 PM onwards):** Subsequent commits introduced:
    *  Use of `axiosInstance` for API calls to `/api/homework/claim-offer`.
    *  JWT token and user ID retrieval using cookies and `useAuth` hook.  This suggests authentication is required.
    *  Country code selection (`+1` initially, then changed to `+91`, and finally a dropdown was implemented to select different country codes with flags).
    *  Error handling using `try...catch...finally` and `toast.success` or `toast.error` messages.
    *  The addition of `sonner` for toast notifications.

* **Country Code Dropdown (5/21/2025, 12:28:04 PM and 12:35:54 PM):**  A significant improvement was the addition of a country code dropdown using `useRef` and `useEffect` to handle outside clicks for closing it.  A list of country codes with flags was added, significantly enhancing internationalization support.  The phone number validation regex changed to accommodate various phone number lengths (`^\d{7,15}$`).

* **Default Country Code (5/21/2025, 12:29:18 PM and 12:32:37 PM, 12:36:08 PM):** The default country code was changed from `+1` to `+91` (India), suggesting a target audience shift.


**`TheAuction.js` Modifications:**

The `TheAuction.js` component was modified to fetch and display tutor statistics.

* **Initial Version (5/21/2025, 12:52:21 PM):**  The initial version was a static component showing a loading animation and placeholder data.

* **API Integration (5/21/2025, 12:58:00 PM onwards):**  Subsequent commits added:
    *  `homeworkId` prop to fetch data based on project ID.
    *  `useAuth` and `Cookies` for authentication token and user ID.
    *  `axiosInstance` to fetch `availableTutorsCount` from `/api/homework/order/available-tutors-stats` endpoint.
    *  Loading state management using `useState` to display "Loading..." until data is fetched.
    *  Error handling and `toast.error` messages.

* **Display of `availableTutorsCount` (5/21/2025, 12:58:00 PM, 1:02:20 PM, 1:02:51PM):**  There were revisions in how `availableTutorsCount` is displayed and integrated into the component's layout.


**`Auction.js` Modifications:**

The `Auction.js` component focuses on displaying the details of an auction related to a project.

* **API Calls (5/21/2025, 1:00:32 PM and 1:00:58 PM):** This component makes API calls to fetch project details (`/api/homework/${id}`) and tutor bids (`/api/bids/order/${id}`).  It uses similar authentication mechanisms as `ClaimOffer.js` and `TheAuction.js`.
* **Prop Change and Component Usage(5/21/2025, 1:00:58 PM):** The `TheAuction` component's prop changed from `id` to `homeworkId`.


**`ActiveProject.js`:**

This component was entirely commented out, suggesting it may be temporarily inactive or removed from the application.  The commented-out code shows a planned component for displaying a list of active projects with filtering and search capabilities, probably using a third-party component library (`@mantine/core`, `@mantine/dates`, etc.).


In summary, the code changes reflect a significant effort in integrating frontend components with a backend API, implementing robust error handling, and enhancing the user interface with interactive elements such as a country code dropdown.  A pattern of using `axiosInstance`, `useAuth`, and `Cookies` for API calls and authentication is consistently applied. The `TheAuction` componentâ€™s changes suggest a focus on providing real-time updates on the status of projects in an auction.
