# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 11:40:17 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `ProductList.jsx` and `CategoryForm.jsx`.  `ProductList.jsx` underwent several revisions between 10:54 AM and 11:00 AM, with the primary focus being on the `handleSubmit` function.  This function, responsible for creating products, was modified to correctly append image URLs and slab data (including coupon IDs and handling potential `null` values in the 'expire' field) to a `FormData` object before sending it for product creation. The changes suggest improvements in handling product data submission.


`CategoryForm.jsx` was updated twice, at 11:20 AM and 11:24 AM. These changes primarily involved styling improvements to the component's UI. The initial update at 11:20 AM introduced a more modern styling using tailwind css,  giving the form a cleaner look with improved input fields, labels, image upload section with visual cues, and better button styling.  The second update at 11:24 AM included minor adjustments to the padding in the component's outer div.  There were no functional changes; only cosmetic updates.

Finally, `CategoryList.jsx` was updated at 11:25 AM. This update involved adding loading states (`isLoading`) to the create, update, and delete category mutations, enhancing the user experience by providing feedback during these operations.  A placeholder for an `AdminMenu` component was also added, suggesting the integration of a navigation menu within the Admin section of the application.


## 12:15:38 PM
The log shows three consecutive commits to `Payment.js`  on May 20, 2025, between 11:58 AM and 11:59 AM.  The changes across all three commits are minimal and appear to be insignificant variations in the code, possibly due to incremental saving or editor auto-formatting.  There are no functional differences observable in the provided code snippets. The file is a React component that renders a payment form with options for full and partial payments, along with various payment methods (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, Stripe).  The component uses inline styles heavily, and includes images for visual elements.  The code is commented to explain sections of the component.
