# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 11:40:17 AM
The log shows updates to two files: `ProductList.jsx` and `CategoryForm.jsx`.  `ProductList.jsx` underwent several revisions between 10:54 AM and 11:00 AM, with the primary focus being on the `handleSubmit` function.  This function, responsible for creating products, was modified to correctly append image URLs and slab data (including coupon IDs and handling potential `null` values in the 'expire' field) to a `FormData` object before sending it for product creation. The changes suggest improvements in handling product data submission.


`CategoryForm.jsx` was updated twice, at 11:20 AM and 11:24 AM. These changes primarily involved styling improvements to the component's UI. The initial update at 11:20 AM introduced a more modern styling using tailwind css,  giving the form a cleaner look with improved input fields, labels, image upload section with visual cues, and better button styling.  The second update at 11:24 AM included minor adjustments to the padding in the component's outer div.  There were no functional changes; only cosmetic updates.

Finally, `CategoryList.jsx` was updated at 11:25 AM. This update involved adding loading states (`isLoading`) to the create, update, and delete category mutations, enhancing the user experience by providing feedback during these operations.  A placeholder for an `AdminMenu` component was also added, suggesting the integration of a navigation menu within the Admin section of the application.
