# Activity Summary for 5/3/2025

## 12:04:03 AM
The log shows a single significant update to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\models\order.model.js` at 2025-05-02 23:31:08.  This update modifies the `order` model schema.  The most notable change is a restructuring of the `status` field.  The previous `status` field, which had a simpler enum of order statuses, has been replaced with a more granular enum reflecting different stages in the order process, including separate stages for graphics, cutout, and accounts processing.  Additionally, a pre-save hook has been implemented to automatically generate unique `orderId` values using a counter model.  The hook handles error propagation correctly. The `created` field now stores the creation date in YYYY-MM-DD format.  Other minor changes include the addition of `customerName` field and  corrections to code comments.
