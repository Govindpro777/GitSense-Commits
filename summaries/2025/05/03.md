# Activity Summary for 5/3/2025

## 12:04:03 AM
The log shows a single significant update to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\models\order.model.js` at 2025-05-02 23:31:08.  This update modifies the `order` model schema.  The most notable change is a restructuring of the `status` field.  The previous `status` field, which had a simpler enum of order statuses, has been replaced with a more granular enum reflecting different stages in the order process, including separate stages for graphics, cutout, and accounts processing.  Additionally, a pre-save hook has been implemented to automatically generate unique `orderId` values using a counter model.  The hook handles error propagation correctly. The `created` field now stores the creation date in YYYY-MM-DD format.  Other minor changes include the addition of `customerName` field and  corrections to code comments.


## 11:18:37 AM
The log shows development activity around an invoice management system.  Key changes include the creation and refinement of Mongoose models (`invoice.model.js` and `cnt.js`) for managing invoices and sequence counters, respectively.  The `invoice.model.js` underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on the pre-save hook for auto-generating invoice numbers using a counter. The counter model (`cnt.js`) was initially empty, then defined to store sequence numbers for invoice generation.

The `invoice.controller.js` handles invoice creation, retrieval, and PDF generation.  It uses `pdfkit` for PDF generation and includes hardcoded company details that could be moved to configuration. This controller was updated to include `invoiceNumber` in the request body for invoice creation. The initial version of the file lacked a route for updating an invoice. A significant change at 10:54:54 AM added  `invoiceNumber` to the `createInvoice` function's parameters.

The routing (`invoice.routes.js`) defines API endpoints for invoice-related operations.  The authentication middleware (`authMiddleware` or `auth`) was implemented at 10:48:59 AM to secure all invoice routes.


The frontend components (`AccountsOrder.jsx` and `InvoiceManager.jsx`) manage the display and interaction with invoice data, including creation and download. `InvoiceManager.jsx` has a small modification in the API endpoint for fetching invoices (`/api/v1//invoices/order/${orderId}` vs `/api/v1/invoices/order/${orderId}`). The `InvoiceModal.jsx` provides a user interface for creating and managing invoices.

The backend server (`index.js`) initializes the application, connects to the database, defines routes, and manages socket.io connections (although the socket.io related changes are not directly relevant to the invoice functionality).  There is no change in the backend server that directly affects the invoice functionality apart from the use of  `authMiddleware` and other changes in route.


The `numberToWords.js` file contains a function to convert numbers into words in the Indian numbering system, which is used in the invoice generation process. No changes were made to this file.  The overall pattern shows a structured approach, separating models, controllers, routes, and frontend components, with a focus on generating and managing invoices in a web application.


## 12:06:55 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `CreateNewProject.js` between 11:31 AM and 11:39 AM on May 3, 2025.  All revisions of `CreateNewProject.js` contain commented-out React code representing a form for creating new projects. The code includes fields for project title, content, type, subject, deadline, and order type, and utilizes a dropdown for selecting project types from a comprehensive list (`typeOptions`).  No functional changes are apparent across the revisions as the code remains commented out.

`HomeworkBanner.js`, updated at 11:37:02 AM on May 3, 2025, is a React component for a homework banner.  It features a form for project description, a toggle for "Human experts only," and integrates with a signup modal (`SignupModal`). The component uses cookies (`js-cookie`) to check authentication (`jwtToken`) and redirects to `/homework/myorders` if a token is found.  Otherwise, the signup modal is displayed. The styling is extensive, using Tailwind CSS for responsive design.


## 12:18:34 PM
The log shows development of an invoice generation and management system.  The `invoice.controller.js` file underwent several revisions between 11:43 AM and 11:55 AM on May 3rd, 2025, primarily focusing on refining invoice creation, retrieval, and PDF generation functionalities.  No changes were made to the core logic of these functions across these commits. The  `invoice.model.js` file was updated at 11:49 AM to include auto-generation of invoice numbers using a counter model.  The frontend component, `InvoiceManager.jsx` (updated at 11:50 AM), provides a user interface for managing invoices, including creating and downloading them.  Finally, an authentication middleware file (`auth.js`, updated at 11:59 AM) introduces various authentication functions to protect routes based on user roles (Admin, SuperAdmin, Accounts, Graphics, Cutout, and Viewer).  The `auth.js` file includes several functions for role-based access control.  The most significant change was the addition of  token verification in the `downloadInvoice` function within `invoice.controller.js` at 11:55 AM.
