# Activity Summary for 5/3/2025

## 12:04:03 AM
The log shows a single significant update to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\models\order.model.js` at 2025-05-02 23:31:08.  This update modifies the `order` model schema.  The most notable change is a restructuring of the `status` field.  The previous `status` field, which had a simpler enum of order statuses, has been replaced with a more granular enum reflecting different stages in the order process, including separate stages for graphics, cutout, and accounts processing.  Additionally, a pre-save hook has been implemented to automatically generate unique `orderId` values using a counter model.  The hook handles error propagation correctly. The `created` field now stores the creation date in YYYY-MM-DD format.  Other minor changes include the addition of `customerName` field and  corrections to code comments.


## 11:18:37 AM
The log shows development activity around an invoice management system.  Key changes include the creation and refinement of Mongoose models (`invoice.model.js` and `cnt.js`) for managing invoices and sequence counters, respectively.  The `invoice.model.js` underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on the pre-save hook for auto-generating invoice numbers using a counter. The counter model (`cnt.js`) was initially empty, then defined to store sequence numbers for invoice generation.

The `invoice.controller.js` handles invoice creation, retrieval, and PDF generation.  It uses `pdfkit` for PDF generation and includes hardcoded company details that could be moved to configuration. This controller was updated to include `invoiceNumber` in the request body for invoice creation. The initial version of the file lacked a route for updating an invoice. A significant change at 10:54:54 AM added  `invoiceNumber` to the `createInvoice` function's parameters.

The routing (`invoice.routes.js`) defines API endpoints for invoice-related operations.  The authentication middleware (`authMiddleware` or `auth`) was implemented at 10:48:59 AM to secure all invoice routes.


The frontend components (`AccountsOrder.jsx` and `InvoiceManager.jsx`) manage the display and interaction with invoice data, including creation and download. `InvoiceManager.jsx` has a small modification in the API endpoint for fetching invoices (`/api/v1//invoices/order/${orderId}` vs `/api/v1/invoices/order/${orderId}`). The `InvoiceModal.jsx` provides a user interface for creating and managing invoices.

The backend server (`index.js`) initializes the application, connects to the database, defines routes, and manages socket.io connections (although the socket.io related changes are not directly relevant to the invoice functionality).  There is no change in the backend server that directly affects the invoice functionality apart from the use of  `authMiddleware` and other changes in route.


The `numberToWords.js` file contains a function to convert numbers into words in the Indian numbering system, which is used in the invoice generation process. No changes were made to this file.  The overall pattern shows a structured approach, separating models, controllers, routes, and frontend components, with a focus on generating and managing invoices in a web application.


## 12:06:55 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `CreateNewProject.js` between 11:31 AM and 11:39 AM on May 3, 2025.  All revisions of `CreateNewProject.js` contain commented-out React code representing a form for creating new projects. The code includes fields for project title, content, type, subject, deadline, and order type, and utilizes a dropdown for selecting project types from a comprehensive list (`typeOptions`).  No functional changes are apparent across the revisions as the code remains commented out.

`HomeworkBanner.js`, updated at 11:37:02 AM on May 3, 2025, is a React component for a homework banner.  It features a form for project description, a toggle for "Human experts only," and integrates with a signup modal (`SignupModal`). The component uses cookies (`js-cookie`) to check authentication (`jwtToken`) and redirects to `/homework/myorders` if a token is found.  Otherwise, the signup modal is displayed. The styling is extensive, using Tailwind CSS for responsive design.


## 12:18:34 PM
The log shows development of an invoice generation and management system.  The `invoice.controller.js` file underwent several revisions between 11:43 AM and 11:55 AM on May 3rd, 2025, primarily focusing on refining invoice creation, retrieval, and PDF generation functionalities.  No changes were made to the core logic of these functions across these commits. The  `invoice.model.js` file was updated at 11:49 AM to include auto-generation of invoice numbers using a counter model.  The frontend component, `InvoiceManager.jsx` (updated at 11:50 AM), provides a user interface for managing invoices, including creating and downloading them.  Finally, an authentication middleware file (`auth.js`, updated at 11:59 AM) introduces various authentication functions to protect routes based on user roles (Admin, SuperAdmin, Accounts, Graphics, Cutout, and Viewer).  The `auth.js` file includes several functions for role-based access control.  The most significant change was the addition of  token verification in the `downloadInvoice` function within `invoice.controller.js` at 11:55 AM.


## 1:06:59 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CreateNewProject.js`, a React component for creating new projects.  The file was repeatedly modified between 12:34 PM and 12:57 PM on May 3, 2025.  The main changes involve adding UI elements and functionality.

Initially, the component was mostly commented out.  The first significant change (12:38 PM)  uncommented the code, revealing a form with fields for project title, content, type, subject, deadline, and order type (self or auto). A significant list of `typeOptions` for project type was also present.

Subsequent changes (12:45 PM and 12:47 PM) reverted the component back to a fully commented-out state.  This suggests potential experimentation or temporary removal of the code.

A more substantial update occurred around 12:50 PM, introducing a "Numbers of Words" section with increment/decrement buttons controlled by `handleWordCountChange`, updating the word count state (`wordCount`).  The `handleWordCountChange` function is introduced  to manage the word count, incrementing or decrementing it by 100, with a minimum of 100 words. The word count is initially set to 1100.

The final changes (between 12:55 PM and 12:57 PM) refined the UI, primarily improving the styling and layout of the "Number of Words" section.  Specifically, padding and background color were adjusted for better visual appeal.  The final version includes the word count feature.

Throughout the edits, the core structure of the component remained consistent, with the primary modifications focused on the addition and refinement of UI elements, particularly the word count feature, and the management of the `wordCount` state.  There is no other recurring pattern besides commenting out and uncommenting the entire code block repeatedly.


## 3:03:22 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions to the `invoice.controller.js` file and one file `AccountsOrder.jsx`.  The `invoice.controller.js` file underwent several updates between 2:10 PM and 2:47 PM on May 3, 2025, all seemingly minor adjustments and comments. The code defines various functions for invoice management: creating invoices, retrieving invoices (all, by ID, by order ID), and downloading invoices as PDFs.  The company details are hardcoded, with a note suggesting moving them to environment variables or a database.  The `downloadInvoice` function includes a commented-out `generateInvoicePDF` helper function, indicating the PDF generation logic was still under development or being refactored. There's also a reference to a `req.params.token` in the `downloadInvoice` function. The commented out code in `AccountsOrder.jsx` shows that it's a React component for managing and displaying account orders. It includes features like filtering, pagination, status updates, and real-time updates via socket events.  The final version of `AccountsOrder.jsx` at 2:52:51 PM includes the fully functional code with socket updates.


## 5:03:23 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `AccountsOrder.jsx` and `InvoiceManager.jsx`.  `AccountsOrder.jsx` underwent numerous revisions between 4:07 PM and 4:36 PM, with no apparent significant changes in functionality across those commits.  The code in `AccountsOrder.jsx` manages a list of orders,  allowing filtering by search term and order status, pagination, and  handling order status updates via a socket connection.  The repeated identical code suggests the commits might reflect an iterative development or debugging process, rather than substantial functional changes.

`InvoiceManager.jsx`, modified between 4:19 PM and 4:41 PM, is a component for managing invoices associated with an order.  It fetches invoices, provides functionality to create new invoices, and allows downloading existing invoices.  Between 4:19 PM and 4:20 PM, some UI elements related to displaying recent invoices were commented out.  Later, at 4:41 PM, the button width was adjusted in the UI.  This file shows a clear evolution of functionality through the commits;  the code remains functionally consistent but undergoes UI modifications.

Both files rely on `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` for API endpoints, indicating a consistent backend interaction method.  Both also utilize `localStorage.getItem("token")` for authentication.


## 6:07:01 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CreateNewProject.js`, a React component likely for creating new projects.  The modifications span approximately 35 minutes (5:33 PM to 5:58 PM on May 3, 2025).

The most significant change involves the implementation of subject category management.  Initially, the component had separate, static select elements for `projectSubject`. The final version introduces `subjectCategories` and `subjects` state variables, fetched from `localStorage`.  These states dynamically populate select menus for category and subject selection, improving user experience and data organization.  The `useEffect` hook fetches category data from `localStorage` upon component mount and updates the available subjects based on the selected category. A new `handleSubjectChange` function updates both the selected subject ID and name.


Other changes include:

* **Deadline Input:** The component initially used a simple text input for the deadline.  This was replaced with a `DateTimePicker` component from the `@mantine/dates` library, allowing for more precise date and time selection. This happened between 5:43 PM and 5:45 PM.

* **Styling Adjustments:** Minor styling adjustments were made throughout the component, affecting various elements' padding, margins, colors, and text sizes.  These changes were incremental and spread across multiple commits.

* **Import Statements:** The initial commit had commented-out import statements.  These were subsequently uncommented, with `DatePickerInput` being replaced by `DateTimePicker`.


The overall pattern indicates iterative development, with small styling refinements and a substantial refactor for more robust subject category handling, making the project creation process more dynamic and user-friendly.


## 8:25:10 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CreateNewProject.js`, a React component for creating new projects.  Significant changes occurred between 6:13 PM and 6:31 PM.

Initially (6:13 PM and 6:14 PM), the component included extensive functionality for creating projects, including file uploads via an axios instance,  handling user authentication using cookies (`jwtToken`, `userId`), and submitting project details (`/api/homework/create`).  The component fetched subject categories from local storage and dynamically updated subject options based on the selected category.  Error handling using `react-toastify` was implemented for various scenarios.

A substantial revision at 6:15 PM removed axios and authentication logic, simplifying the component to only display the form and log the form data to the console.  `orderType` changed from `SELF_SELECTED`/`AUTO_MATCHED` to `self`/`auto`. The `useRef` hook and related functions for file handling were also removed.


The changes at 6:31 PM and 6:32 PM reintroduced core functionality, replacing the direct `axios` calls with  `axiosInstance` from `@/lib/axiosInstance`, and  `react-toastify` with `sonner`.  Authentication is now managed using `useAuth` hook from `@/lib/authContext`,  prioritizing the `authState` object over cookies. The file upload logic was streamlined. The `/api/files/upload` endpoint now accepts `uploadType` as a query parameter.  The `handleSubmit` function now sends data to the `/api/homework/create` endpoint with user ID as a parameter.  The `Content` label now specifies a minimum length for the content. The accepted file types were slightly reduced.

Finally,  the logs from 6:33 PM to 6:38 PM show multiple instances of the component being completely commented out, suggesting temporary removal or experimentation.  There's a recurring pattern of changes related to styling using tailwind CSS-like classes throughout all versions.  The consistent use of `useEffect` hooks to manage subject categories and subjects is also notable.
