# Activity Summary for 5/31/2025

## 11:10:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `TeacherSearch.jsx` on May 31, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is enhancing the teacher search functionality.

Initially (10:18:11 AM and 10:18:51 AM), the component displayed a simple teacher search and selection mechanism. It allowed adding and removing teachers, displaying a warning if a teacher was already selected. The filtering was basic, only searching by the concatenation of first and last name.

A significant update occurred at 10:19:30 AM and again at 10:20:31 AM. These versions introduced  filtering based on teacher `status` (showing only "Active" teachers) and `teachingMode` (matching the `courseMode` prop, which defaults to "offline").  The search now also handles cases where first or last names might be missing, using a conditional operator to prevent errors. The displayed information in the dropdown was improved to include the teacher's teaching mode and status.  Additionally,  a `getTeacherDisplayName` function was added to handle cases where teacher name data might be incomplete.  The placeholder text in the search input now dynamically reflects the `courseMode`.  The UI was also enhanced with better visual feedback  making the teacher mode and status more prominent, using flexbox for better layout.  The version reverted back to earlier version at 10:20:31 AM, which omits the added functionalities related to filtering based on teaching mode and status, and display.

The earlier versions (before 10:19:30 AM) were commented out in later commits, suggesting a potential iterative development process where features were added and then potentially removed or reverted. The final version of the file (10:20:31 AM) appears to be a reversion to an earlier simpler version.


## 12:15:50 PM
The log shows code changes across three files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` application.  The most significant changes are in `page.js` (signup page) and `Comments.js` (review comments section).  `Rating.jsx` shows commented-out code, suggesting a potential refactor or temporary disabling of functionality.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\(auth)\signup\page.js` (5/31/2025, 11:34:37 AM):** This file contains the code for the user signup page. Key updates include:

* **Enhanced Signup Form:** The signup form is implemented using `react-hook-form` and `zod` for validation.  The form handles email and password input, including password strength checking with real-time feedback.  Password strength is determined based on length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. A popover displays password strength criteria.
* **Redux Integration:**  The component uses `react-redux` to dispatch the `registerUser` action and utilizes a custom `useAuth` hook for authentication state management.
* **Conditional Routing:**  The code includes sophisticated conditional routing based on user role ("STUDENT" or "TUTOR") and authentication status.  Different routes are triggered based on the user's role and profile completion status.
* **Tutor Onboarding:**  A specific branch in the `onSubmit` function handles the onboarding process for tutors, involving an extra API call (`/api/tutor/onboard-tutor`) and dispatching `fetchTutorProfile` and `profileAction` actions.
* **Cookie Handling:**  The code uses `js-cookie` to set cookies for `userId` and `jwtToken` after successful signup.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews\Comments.js` (5/31/2025, 12:01:32 PM):** This file manages the display and interaction with tutor reviews.  Updates include:

* **Review Card Component:** A `CommentCard` component renders individual review items, differentiating between student and tutor reviews.  It provides options for replying to, editing, or deleting reviews (depending on the user's role). A three-dot menu handles these actions.
* **Menu Management:** The `CommentCard` uses state to manage the visibility of the options menu and closes it when clicking outside the menu.
* **Loading Indicator:** A `ClipLoader` is used to indicate when more reviews are loading.
* **Responsive Design:** The component is designed with responsive styling (`calc` is used extensively for dynamic sizing)


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews\Rating.jsx` (5/31/2025, 12:01:04 PM and 5/31/2025, 12:01:50 PM):**  This file appears to be commented out completely in both its entries.  This suggests that the component might be temporarily disabled or undergoing a significant revision. The commented-out code suggests it was a component for displaying ratings and reviews, with features such as sorting and displaying average ratings.


The timestamps indicate that the signup page was updated first, followed by changes to the review components. The consistent use of responsive design techniques (`calc` for dynamic sizing), and the extensive use of React components, libraries like `react-hook-form`, `zod`, and `react-redux` suggests a well-structured and modern frontend application.
