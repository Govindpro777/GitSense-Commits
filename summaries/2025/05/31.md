# Activity Summary for 5/31/2025

## 11:10:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `TeacherSearch.jsx` on May 31, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is enhancing the teacher search functionality.

Initially (10:18:11 AM and 10:18:51 AM), the component displayed a simple teacher search and selection mechanism. It allowed adding and removing teachers, displaying a warning if a teacher was already selected. The filtering was basic, only searching by the concatenation of first and last name.

A significant update occurred at 10:19:30 AM and again at 10:20:31 AM. These versions introduced  filtering based on teacher `status` (showing only "Active" teachers) and `teachingMode` (matching the `courseMode` prop, which defaults to "offline").  The search now also handles cases where first or last names might be missing, using a conditional operator to prevent errors. The displayed information in the dropdown was improved to include the teacher's teaching mode and status.  Additionally,  a `getTeacherDisplayName` function was added to handle cases where teacher name data might be incomplete.  The placeholder text in the search input now dynamically reflects the `courseMode`.  The UI was also enhanced with better visual feedback  making the teacher mode and status more prominent, using flexbox for better layout.  The version reverted back to earlier version at 10:20:31 AM, which omits the added functionalities related to filtering based on teaching mode and status, and display.

The earlier versions (before 10:19:30 AM) were commented out in later commits, suggesting a potential iterative development process where features were added and then potentially removed or reverted. The final version of the file (10:20:31 AM) appears to be a reversion to an earlier simpler version.


## 12:15:50 PM
The log shows code changes across three files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` application.  The most significant changes are in `page.js` (signup page) and `Comments.js` (review comments section).  `Rating.jsx` shows commented-out code, suggesting a potential refactor or temporary disabling of functionality.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\(auth)\signup\page.js` (5/31/2025, 11:34:37 AM):** This file contains the code for the user signup page. Key updates include:

* **Enhanced Signup Form:** The signup form is implemented using `react-hook-form` and `zod` for validation.  The form handles email and password input, including password strength checking with real-time feedback.  Password strength is determined based on length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. A popover displays password strength criteria.
* **Redux Integration:**  The component uses `react-redux` to dispatch the `registerUser` action and utilizes a custom `useAuth` hook for authentication state management.
* **Conditional Routing:**  The code includes sophisticated conditional routing based on user role ("STUDENT" or "TUTOR") and authentication status.  Different routes are triggered based on the user's role and profile completion status.
* **Tutor Onboarding:**  A specific branch in the `onSubmit` function handles the onboarding process for tutors, involving an extra API call (`/api/tutor/onboard-tutor`) and dispatching `fetchTutorProfile` and `profileAction` actions.
* **Cookie Handling:**  The code uses `js-cookie` to set cookies for `userId` and `jwtToken` after successful signup.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews\Comments.js` (5/31/2025, 12:01:32 PM):** This file manages the display and interaction with tutor reviews.  Updates include:

* **Review Card Component:** A `CommentCard` component renders individual review items, differentiating between student and tutor reviews.  It provides options for replying to, editing, or deleting reviews (depending on the user's role). A three-dot menu handles these actions.
* **Menu Management:** The `CommentCard` uses state to manage the visibility of the options menu and closes it when clicking outside the menu.
* **Loading Indicator:** A `ClipLoader` is used to indicate when more reviews are loading.
* **Responsive Design:** The component is designed with responsive styling (`calc` is used extensively for dynamic sizing)


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews\Rating.jsx` (5/31/2025, 12:01:04 PM and 5/31/2025, 12:01:50 PM):**  This file appears to be commented out completely in both its entries.  This suggests that the component might be temporarily disabled or undergoing a significant revision. The commented-out code suggests it was a component for displaying ratings and reviews, with features such as sorting and displaying average ratings.


The timestamps indicate that the signup page was updated first, followed by changes to the review components. The consistent use of responsive design techniques (`calc` for dynamic sizing), and the extensive use of React components, libraries like `react-hook-form`, `zod`, and `react-redux` suggests a well-structured and modern frontend application.


## 1:15:48 PM
The code changes primarily involve the development of a tutor review and rating management page.  Several files were updated on May 31st, 2025.

`Rating.jsx` (12:24:46 PM): This file contains a React component (`ManageRating`) for displaying and managing tutor ratings.  It fetches rating data (initially hardcoded), renders star ratings, provides sorting options ("Newest First," "Oldest First," "Highest Rating," "Lowest Rating"), and includes pop-up components for replying to, editing, and deleting reviews. The component uses several React hooks like `useState` and `useMemo` for state management and optimization.

`Comments.js` (12:36:59 PM and 12:39:36 PM): This file defines a `CommentCard` component for displaying individual reviews and a `CommentSection` component to render a list of reviews.  `CommentCard` includes functionality for displaying user avatars, review text, timestamps, and a three-dot menu with options for replying to, editing, and deleting reviews. The `CommentSection` component handles pagination or loading of reviews and adds a visual cue for tutor replies.  A later commit added a `onSetFeatured` prop to `CommentCard`, suggesting the addition of a feature to mark reviews as featured.


`layout.js` (1:04:11 PM): This file is a simple layout component that extracts the tutor's slug from the route parameters using the `use` hook to handle asynchronous data fetching.

`page.jsx` (1:04:32 PM): This file renders the main review management page. It displays a title ("Manage Review & Ratings"), an image, and uses the `Rating` component. A significant change was the addition of proper handling of route parameters using the `use` hook to fetch  `params` and `searchParams` asynchronously, and passing the extracted `tutorId` (tutor slug) to the `Rating` component.


The overall pattern in the code is a well-structured React application using functional components, hooks, and external libraries for UI elements and date formatting.  The time stamps show a concentrated period of development, suggesting a focused coding session. The changes reflect a progressive enhancement of the review management functionality, moving from a static view to a dynamic, interactive component capable of handling user actions and asynchronous data fetching.


## 2:15:45 PM
The log shows development of a tutor review management page.  Initial commits (around 1:23 PM and 1:25 PM)  created basic page structure (`page.jsx`) displaying a title and a placeholder rating component (`Rating.jsx`), which was initially heavily commented out. A `Comments.js` file was added at 1:28 PM,  providing components for displaying and managing individual reviews, including reply, edit and delete functionalities.

Significant changes occurred around 1:55 PM and 2:14 PM in `page.jsx`.  These modifications integrated user authentication using `useAuth` and `js-cookie` to fetch the `tutorId`, allowing the tutor to manage their own reviews. The commented-out code in the `Rating.jsx` file remained unchanged despite multiple commits.  The final commit at 2:14 PM shows no code changes to `page.jsx` compared to the previous commit.  The pattern shows iterative development, with the `Rating.jsx` component seemingly undergoing significant revisions outside of the logged changes.


## 3:15:45 PM
The log shows a single code change on May 31, 2025, at 2:16:59 PM, affecting the file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\tutor\[tutor-name-slug]\(main)\reviews\page.jsx`.  This file is a React component (`TutorListPage`) responsible for displaying a review and rating management section.  The component uses several React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.), fetches user authentication data (`useAuth`), and utilizes cookies as a fallback mechanism to obtain user ID.  It renders a heading, an image (`Vector1.svg`), and a custom `Rating` component, passing the `tutorId` which is derived from the authentication state or cookies.  The code suggests the component is designed for a tutor to manage their own reviews;  `tutorId` is currently equated to `userId`.  The styling is done using Tailwind CSS.


## 4:15:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React component files within a `reviews` directory of a tutor-specific application.  The changes primarily focus on adding backend integration and improving UI elements for review management.

`Comments.js` was updated  at 3:18:52 PM on 5/31/2025.  The key change was converting a commented-out component into a functional component that renders comments, replies, and includes functionality for replying to, editing, and deleting comments and replies. The update introduced `axiosInstance` for API calls, `useAuth` for authentication, and `js-cookie` for cookie management.  The UI is heavily styled using Tailwind CSS classes.

`DeleteReviewPopup.js` was updated at 3:19:22 PM on 5/31/2025.  The component, a modal for deleting reviews, was significantly enhanced.  It now uses `axiosInstance` to send delete requests to the backend, incorporating authentication via `useAuth` and `js-cookie`.  Error handling and success messages using `sonner`'s `toast` are now included,  and  the UI shows more detailed review information including reply texts.

`EditReplyPopup.js` was updated at 3:19:37 PM on 5/31/2025. Similar to `DeleteReviewPopup.js`, this modal for editing replies was improved with backend integration using `axiosInstance`. It now deletes the existing reply before posting the updated one.  Error handling and success messages with `sonner` were added, and the UI includes loading state.

`ReviewReplyPopup.js` was updated at 3:20:05 PM on 5/31/2025. This modal for replying to reviews was enhanced with `axiosInstance` for backend communication, using `useAuth` and `js-cookie` for authentication, and `sonner` for displaying feedback to the user. Loading states were also added to the UI.

`Rating.jsx` underwent multiple revisions between 3:43:09 PM and 4:14:25 PM on 5/31/2025. These revisions appear to be incremental changes, possibly related to refactoring or bug fixes, with no significant functional changes in the commented-out code. The commented-out code suggests a component displaying tutor ratings, reviews and a comment section, with sorting and popup functionalities.

A recurring pattern across the updates is the consistent use of `axiosInstance`, `useAuth`, `js-cookie`, and `sonner` for handling API calls, authentication, and user feedback. This suggests a coordinated effort to integrate these components' functionalities throughout the `reviews` section of the application.


## 5:15:57 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the review and rating system of a tutor profile page within a React application.  The primary focus is on integrating API calls for fetching, updating, and deleting reviews and replies.

`Rating.jsx`:  This component underwent the most significant changes. Initially, it contained hardcoded review data.  Between 4:16 PM and 4:30 PM, the component was refactored,  removing the hardcoded data.  The final version (4:30 PM)  incorporates API calls using `axiosInstance` to fetch review data and statistics (average rating, total reviews, star distribution), implements pagination using infinite scroll, and handles loading and error states.  JWT token and user ID are used for authentication and authorization.  The component now uses  `sonner` for toast notifications.

`EditReplyPopup.js`: This component, added at 4:30 PM, provides a popup for editing tutor replies to reviews. It uses `axiosInstance` to delete the existing reply and post the updated reply, incorporating error handling and loading indicators and uses `sonner` for toast notifications.


`ReviewReplyPopup.js`:  Added at 4:31 PM, this component handles adding replies to reviews.  Similar to `EditReplyPopup.js`, it uses `axiosInstance` for API interactions and includes loading states and error handling with `sonner` for toast notifications. It also displays the review details, including star ratings and time since creation.

`Comments.js`:  This file, updated multiple times between 4:31 PM and 5:04 PM,  displays reviews and replies. It includes functionality to reply to reviews, delete reviews/replies, edit tutor replies, toggle review featuring status, and handle loading states.  Changes across these updates included refinements to the UI (mostly image imports and adjustments to styling),  and the implementation of feature toggling via API calls.  `sonner` for toast notifications is also used here.  The UI uses icons from `lucide-react` and images from various paths (`/landing-page/project/avtar.svg`, `/Community-page/clock.svg`, `/RatingIcons/edit.svg`, `/RatingIcons/delete.svg`).  The `Image` component appears to be imported from both `@mantine/core` and `next/image`.

`page.jsx`: Minor changes to this file (between 5:05 PM and 5:05 PM)  involved repositioning an image on the page.  This file acts as the main container for the review management section, rendering the `Rating` component.


Overall, the changes reflect a significant enhancement of the review management functionality, moving from a static example to a fully functional, API-driven system with robust error handling and UI improvements.  A recurring pattern is the consistent use of `axiosInstance` for API calls, `Cookies` and `useAuth` for authentication, and `sonner` for user feedback.  The multiple small updates to `Comments.js` suggest an iterative development process, focusing on UI refinements and error handling.


## 6:15:51 PM
The log shows multiple updates to React components related to tutor reviews.  The most significant changes are in `Rating.jsx`, which underwent several revisions between 5:58:41 PM and 6:05:32 PM.  These modifications primarily involved refining the component's functionality for fetching, displaying, and sorting reviews using the `/api/common/tutor/get/review` endpoint.  The component now incorporates pagination, infinite scrolling, and error handling.  It also includes pop-up modals (`ReviewReplyPopup`, `DeleteReviewPopup`, `EditReplyPopup`) for various review actions.  The `Comments.js` file was also updated (5:40:30 PM and 5:41:52 PM), enhancing the display and interaction with individual review comments, including features for replying, editing, deleting, and toggling featured status using the `/api/common/set/featured/review` and `/api/common/tutor/reply/review` endpoints.  `ReviewReplyPopup.js` received updates (5:40:55 PM, 5:41:38 PM, and 5:55:17 PM) focusing on improving the user interface and the time formatting of review timestamps, utilizing `date-fns`.  A common pattern across all files is the use of `axiosInstance` for API calls and `useAuth` and `Cookies` for authentication.  The `sonner` library is used for displaying toast notifications.  Most changes clustered around 6 PM.


## 7:15:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `Comments.js` file within a React application, spanning approximately 24 minutes on May 31, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be on improving the UI and functionality of a comment/review section.

Initially, the code includes two components, `CommentCard` and `CommentCard2`, both seemingly designed to display individual comments with features like reply, edit, delete, and featured toggling.  `CommentCard2` is more fully featured and included a reply field.  The major changes across the revisions center around the refactoring and merging of these two components, simplifying the codebase.  The initial `CommentCard` is much less feature-rich than `CommentCard2`.

Early revisions (6:24 PM - 6:27 PM) primarily involved consolidating the similar functionalities of `CommentCard` and `CommentCard2`, with incremental changes in styling and the addition of a simple "Reply" span.

Later revisions (6:31 PM - 6:38 PM) introduced a significant functional change.  The reply functionality was enhanced from a simple "Reply" span to a fully functional reply input field which appears only after the user clicks "Reply".  This involved adding state variables (`showReplyInput`, `replyText`) to manage the reply input visibility and content. The reply submission now directly calls the `onReply` function passed as props.  The visual presentation of the reply section also improved with more explicit styling.  There's also consistent refactoring throughout to consolidate the logic into a single `CommentCard` component.

Subsequent revisions (6:38 PM - 6:50 PM) mainly focused on refining the styling of the reply section, improving the responsiveness of the "Reply" button and making its appearance consistent.  The conditional rendering for the reply input in `CommentCard` is also optimized for better readability and functionality.  The `handleReplyClick` function was adjusted to only allow replies for non-tutor replies.

The final revision (6:58 PM) introduces a new component, `CommentSection`, which manages the overall display and loading of comments using `CommentCard`.  This component handles pagination/loading more than two comments (`showFullReview` functionality) and uses a unique key generation function (`generateReviewKey`) to identify each review uniquely, preventing React key warnings.  The `CommentSection` component handles additional actions like editing and deleting reviews and replies.

Throughout the entire log, a consistent pattern is observed: the use of `axiosInstance` for API calls (likely for handling reviews and features) and `useAuth` and `js-cookie` for authentication and token management.  The extensive use of responsive design patterns in the CSS classes further highlights the focus on UI/UX and adaptation to different screen sizes.


## 8:15:48 PM
The log shows several React component updates related to tutor review management on May 31st, 2025.  The most significant changes were made between 7:22 PM and 7:25 PM, focusing on handling review replies and deletion.

`ReviewReplyPopup.js`: This component, updated multiple times, handles replying to reviews. Key improvements include adding a `cleanText` helper function to sanitize user input (removing quotes) before sending to the backend, enhancing security and preventing potential injection vulnerabilities.  The final version, completed around 7:24 PM, reflects these changes.

`Comments.js`:  This component displays tutor reviews and their replies.  A notable addition is the `cleanText` function, mirroring the change in `ReviewReplyPopup.js`, applied to both reviews and replies to ensure data sanitization.  This file was updated at 7:23 PM and again at 7:25 PM,  with the later update integrating the `cleanText` function.

`EditReplyPopup.js`: This component allows editing existing replies. It was updated twice, at 7:23 PM and 7:24 PM. The key change mirrors the other files: it includes the `cleanText` function to sanitize reply text before updating on the backend. The update ensures consistent input sanitization across components.

`DeleteReviewPopup.js`:  This component, updated at 7:24 PM, handles deleting reviews.  It displays review details (including replies) before confirmation.  It consistently uses `axiosInstance` for API calls and `toast` for user feedback.

`page.jsx`: This file, updated at 8:07 PM, is a client-side component that displays a "Manage Review & Ratings" section, rendering a rating component (`Rating`) using the logged-in user's ID or a cookie-based ID if available for identifying the tutor.  This is separate from the review reply and delete functionality changes seen in the other files.

Recurring elements across the files include the use of `axiosInstance` for API interactions, `Cookies` for authentication, `toast` for user feedback, and a consistent styling pattern using Tailwind CSS.  A consistent pattern of error handling is also evident, always checking for required information (`tutorId`, `reviewId`, `jwtToken`) before API calls.  The addition of the `cleanText` function to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities highlights a focus on security across the codebase.
