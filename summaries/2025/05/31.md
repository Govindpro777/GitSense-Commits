# Activity Summary for 5/31/2025

## 11:10:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `TeacherSearch.jsx` on May 31, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is enhancing the teacher search functionality.

Initially (10:18:11 AM and 10:18:51 AM), the component displayed a simple teacher search and selection mechanism. It allowed adding and removing teachers, displaying a warning if a teacher was already selected. The filtering was basic, only searching by the concatenation of first and last name.

A significant update occurred at 10:19:30 AM and again at 10:20:31 AM. These versions introduced  filtering based on teacher `status` (showing only "Active" teachers) and `teachingMode` (matching the `courseMode` prop, which defaults to "offline").  The search now also handles cases where first or last names might be missing, using a conditional operator to prevent errors. The displayed information in the dropdown was improved to include the teacher's teaching mode and status.  Additionally,  a `getTeacherDisplayName` function was added to handle cases where teacher name data might be incomplete.  The placeholder text in the search input now dynamically reflects the `courseMode`.  The UI was also enhanced with better visual feedback  making the teacher mode and status more prominent, using flexbox for better layout.  The version reverted back to earlier version at 10:20:31 AM, which omits the added functionalities related to filtering based on teaching mode and status, and display.

The earlier versions (before 10:19:30 AM) were commented out in later commits, suggesting a potential iterative development process where features were added and then potentially removed or reverted. The final version of the file (10:20:31 AM) appears to be a reversion to an earlier simpler version.
