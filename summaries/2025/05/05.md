# Activity Summary for 5/5/2025

## 12:23:31 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 4th, 2025, at 9:23:14 PM to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\trial.js`.  This change introduces a React component called `Trial`. This component renders a form for collecting project information, including a project name (using a text input and a textarea, both seemingly incorrectly bound to the same `projectName` state), and allows for file attachment.  The form includes basic styling using Tailwind CSS classes.  A minimum character length requirement (15 characters) is indicated for project name.  There is a minor error in the code where both the input and textarea fields use the same state variable `projectName`.
