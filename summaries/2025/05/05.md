# Activity Summary for 5/5/2025

## 12:23:31 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 4th, 2025, at 9:23:14 PM to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\trial.js`.  This change introduces a React component called `Trial`. This component renders a form for collecting project information, including a project name (using a text input and a textarea, both seemingly incorrectly bound to the same `projectName` state), and allows for file attachment.  The form includes basic styling using Tailwind CSS classes.  A minimum character length requirement (15 characters) is indicated for project name.  There is a minor error in the code where both the input and textarea fields use the same state variable `projectName`.


## 12:23:33 AM
The log shows modifications to `trial.js`, a React component likely part of a landing page for project submission.  The file was edited three times on May 4th, 2025, within a short timeframe (around 9:19 PM to 9:21 PM).  The core functionality of the component remained largely unchanged; it's a form with fields for project name and content, along with a file attachment feature.

The only substantive change between the revisions is the removal of an `<Image />` component from within the file attachment section at 9:21:13 PM. The `textarea` element consistently uses the `projectName` state for both value and onChange, which is likely an error and should probably be changed to a separate state variable for content.  The other modifications appear to be insignificant, possibly due to autosave or minor formatting adjustments.


## 11:34:22 AM
The log shows two revisions of `ProjectDetails.js`, both on May 5th, 2025.  The first revision (11:19:23 AM) adds an `onClick` handler to the "Attach a File" link, opening an upload modal. The second revision (11:23:15 AM) is nearly identical, with the only visible difference being a change in how images are rendered within the chat list section.  Specifically, `<Image>` components are replaced with `<img>` tags for displaying user avatars.  No other functional changes are apparent between the two commits.  The component renders a project details section, including a chat list, and an upload modal.  The styling uses extensive inline CSS with tailwind-like class names.
