# Activity Summary for 5/5/2025

## 12:23:31 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 4th, 2025, at 9:23:14 PM to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\trial.js`.  This change introduces a React component called `Trial`. This component renders a form for collecting project information, including a project name (using a text input and a textarea, both seemingly incorrectly bound to the same `projectName` state), and allows for file attachment.  The form includes basic styling using Tailwind CSS classes.  A minimum character length requirement (15 characters) is indicated for project name.  There is a minor error in the code where both the input and textarea fields use the same state variable `projectName`.


## 12:23:33 AM
The log shows modifications to `trial.js`, a React component likely part of a landing page for project submission.  The file was edited three times on May 4th, 2025, within a short timeframe (around 9:19 PM to 9:21 PM).  The core functionality of the component remained largely unchanged; it's a form with fields for project name and content, along with a file attachment feature.

The only substantive change between the revisions is the removal of an `<Image />` component from within the file attachment section at 9:21:13 PM. The `textarea` element consistently uses the `projectName` state for both value and onChange, which is likely an error and should probably be changed to a separate state variable for content.  The other modifications appear to be insignificant, possibly due to autosave or minor formatting adjustments.


## 11:34:22 AM
The log shows two revisions of `ProjectDetails.js`, both on May 5th, 2025.  The first revision (11:19:23 AM) adds an `onClick` handler to the "Attach a File" link, opening an upload modal. The second revision (11:23:15 AM) is nearly identical, with the only visible difference being a change in how images are rendered within the chat list section.  Specifically, `<Image>` components are replaced with `<img>` tags for displaying user avatars.  No other functional changes are apparent between the two commits.  The component renders a project details section, including a chat list, and an upload modal.  The styling uses extensive inline CSS with tailwind-like class names.


## 2:32:54 PM
The log shows updates to two React component files: `ProjectDetails.js` and `Auction.js`.

**`ProjectDetails.js` (May 5, 2025):**  Two entries exist for this file. The first entry (1:54:51 PM) introduces a  `ProjectDetails` component containing significant UI elements for displaying project details.  These include sections for attaching files (with an `onClick` handler to open a modal), project type, subject area, subject, an "Express Project" section showing a deadline, word count, expandable details (showing project ID and added date), and an "Edit Details" button.  The component also displays app promotion content and a chat list with several sample entries showing tutor information (name, rating, message, price, and verification status).  Finally, it includes a section to invite more tutors. An `UploadFiles` component is used for file uploads.

The second entry (2:09:02 PM) completely removes all code from the `ProjectDetails.js` file, suggesting a complete deletion or accidental overwrite of the component.


**`Auction.js` (May 5, 2025, 2:14:51 PM):** This file contains a `Auction` component displaying a progress tracker for project stages,  an explanation of annotated bibliographies, and the main content area showing information about a project's auction status.  The UI elements include illustrations, text descriptions, and a section to promote project visibility for more bids. It also features a referral section, encouraging users to share the platform and includes social media icons for sharing. The component utilizes a `TutorCard` component (which seems defined elsewhere, potentially in `ExpertCard.js`) for displaying tutor information. The sorting functionality allows the user to sort tutors by relevance and price.  The code also handles closing of a sort modal when a click occurs outside the modal.



The changes highlight a significant disruption in the development process, as evidenced by the complete removal of all code in `ProjectDetails.js` after the initial creation.  The `Auction.js` file showcases a more stable and feature-rich component.  There's a consistent use of styled components and inline styles, utilizing Tailwind CSS-like syntax within the JSX.  Both components extensively use the `Image` component from `next/image`.


## 3:17:51 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `invoice.controller.js` file between 2:28 PM and 3:10 PM on May 5th, 2025, primarily focused on refining the invoice generation and PDF functionality.  There are no changes after 3:10 PM.  The code consistently handles invoice creation, retrieval (by ID and order ID), and download as PDF.  The `COMPANY_DETAILS` object remains unchanged throughout, suggesting a potential area for improvement by moving this data to a configuration file or database.  The `downloadInvoice` function was initially incomplete (only comments) but became fully functional by the final revision.  The final version of `invoice.controller.js` includes a `generateInvoicePDF` function which creates a PDF invoice with company and customer details, a table for items, and a summary.  Between 3:15PM and 3:17PM the `InvoiceModal.jsx` file was updated to include more robust form validation and added a button to preview the invoice.  Finally, at 3:10:24 PM the `invoice.routes.js` file was updated to include a new route for invoice preview.  The `OrderDetail.jsx` file was updated at 3:16:31 PM to incorporate the new invoice preview functionality.


## 4:32:58 PM
The log shows numerous edits to React components related to project creation and display within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` application.  The majority of changes between 3:42 PM and 4:00 PM on May 5th, 2025,  focus on `CreateNewProject.js`. These edits appear to be minor styling adjustments and don't significantly alter the component's functionality.  The code remains largely consistent across these revisions, focusing on form elements, dropdowns for project types and subjects, and fetching subject categories from local storage.  The `useEffect` hooks manage the population of subject options based on the selected category.

A more substantial change occurred around 3:56 PM in `page.jsx` within the `homework/auction/[id]` route. This file was modified to pass the `id` parameter (presumably an auction ID) to the `Auction` component.

Further modifications to `Auction.js` between 3:57 PM and 4:00 PM involved adding the display of project steps (progress tracker) and a refer-a-friend section, which are extensive UI updates adding substantial functionality and visual elements.  The `Auction` component now logs the received `id` and includes extensive styling using Tailwind CSS.  There are also changes that rearrange UI elements (specifically the refer a friend section) to improve mobile responsiveness.

Finally, there's an unchanged `ProjectDetails.js` entry logged at 4:09 PM that displays project details with no changes in the given logs.  This component includes functionality for attaching files via a modal, but the code provided doesn't show the modal implementation itself.


## 5:32:54 PM
The log shows changes to two React component files within a front-end project (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).

The `Auction.js` file, updated at 5/5/2025, 5:29:03 PM, displays an auction progress tracker and project details.  The tracker shows project steps (Submit, Auction, In progress, Warranty, Completed) using a visual indicator. The component also includes a section for an annotated bibliography description and a main content area showing project information, along with a section for inviting friends and earning rewards.  The sorting functionality is implemented using a modal, allowing users to sort tutors by relevance or price.  The component uses various UI elements such as SVG icons and Next.js' `Image` component for display.

The `CreateNewProject.js` file underwent multiple updates between 5/5/2025, 5:30:33 PM and 5/5/2025, 5:31:28 PM.  All three commits for this file are commented-out code.  This suggests the component is either under development or temporarily disabled. The commented-out code shows a form for creating a new project, including fields for title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type, and word count. It also features category management, fetching categories and subjects from localStorage.  The component uses  `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/dates` and Next.js components (`Image`, `Link`).  The commented out code indicates a fairly complex form with multiple select options for project type and subject, based on categories stored in localStorage.  The absence of actual code suggests that this component was likely undergoing modifications or debugging during the period of these log entries.


## 6:17:48 PM
The `InvoiceModal.jsx` component underwent a minor update between 5:24:28 PM and 5:25:06 PM on May 5, 2025.  The primary change involved adding  `min="0"`, `step="0.01"` attributes to the rate input field and `step="0.1"` to the quantity input field, enforcing non-negative numerical values. A delete button was added to each invoice item row, utilizing the `Trash` icon from `lucide-react`.  The delete functionality is disabled if only one item exists. The code also now includes the currency symbol "â‚¹" in the invoice summary.  The rest of the component's structure, including the invoice creation and management logic, remained largely unchanged. The component handles invoice creation, displaying existing invoices, calculating totals (subtotal, CGST, SGST, total), and providing feedback messages for success or error.  It uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state and side effects.


## 6:32:56 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `CreateNewProject.js`, a React component for creating new projects.  The code remains largely consistent across all revisions, focusing on a form for project creation.  The timestamps indicate a period of intense activity between 5:33 PM and 5:39 PM, followed by a longer pause before further changes at 6:11 PM and 6:13 PM.


The component uses various React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage form state.  It fetches subject categories from `localStorage` and updates the available subjects based on the selected category. The `typeOptions` array contains a list of project types.  The user interface elements are styled using Tailwind CSS. No functional changes are observed across the multiple commits.  All commits seem to be the same except for timestamp and may represent a series of autosaves or very minor, uncommitted changes.


## 10:50:26 PM
The log shows two nearly identical commits to `CreateNewProject.js` within a minute of each other on May 5th, 2025, at approximately 6:45 PM.  The file contains React code for a new project creation form.  The form includes fields for project title, content, type, subject category, subject, a file attachment, and word count.  Subject categories and subjects are managed via `useEffect` hooks, fetching categories from `localStorage` and updating available subjects based on the selected category.  The `typeOptions` constant defines an array of project types.  No substantive code changes are visible between the two commits.  The commits likely represent an insignificant edit or a version control artifact rather than a functional update.
