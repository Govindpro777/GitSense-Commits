# Activity Summary for 5/5/2025

## 12:23:31 AM
The log shows a single code change on May 4th, 2025, at 9:23:14 PM to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\trial.js`.  This change introduces a React component called `Trial`. This component renders a form for collecting project information, including a project name (using a text input and a textarea, both seemingly incorrectly bound to the same `projectName` state), and allows for file attachment.  The form includes basic styling using Tailwind CSS classes.  A minimum character length requirement (15 characters) is indicated for project name.  There is a minor error in the code where both the input and textarea fields use the same state variable `projectName`.


## 12:23:33 AM
The log shows modifications to `trial.js`, a React component likely part of a landing page for project submission.  The file was edited three times on May 4th, 2025, within a short timeframe (around 9:19 PM to 9:21 PM).  The core functionality of the component remained largely unchanged; it's a form with fields for project name and content, along with a file attachment feature.

The only substantive change between the revisions is the removal of an `<Image />` component from within the file attachment section at 9:21:13 PM. The `textarea` element consistently uses the `projectName` state for both value and onChange, which is likely an error and should probably be changed to a separate state variable for content.  The other modifications appear to be insignificant, possibly due to autosave or minor formatting adjustments.


## 11:34:22 AM
The log shows two revisions of `ProjectDetails.js`, both on May 5th, 2025.  The first revision (11:19:23 AM) adds an `onClick` handler to the "Attach a File" link, opening an upload modal. The second revision (11:23:15 AM) is nearly identical, with the only visible difference being a change in how images are rendered within the chat list section.  Specifically, `<Image>` components are replaced with `<img>` tags for displaying user avatars.  No other functional changes are apparent between the two commits.  The component renders a project details section, including a chat list, and an upload modal.  The styling uses extensive inline CSS with tailwind-like class names.


## 2:32:54 PM
The log shows updates to two React component files: `ProjectDetails.js` and `Auction.js`.

**`ProjectDetails.js` (May 5, 2025):**  Two entries exist for this file. The first entry (1:54:51 PM) introduces a  `ProjectDetails` component containing significant UI elements for displaying project details.  These include sections for attaching files (with an `onClick` handler to open a modal), project type, subject area, subject, an "Express Project" section showing a deadline, word count, expandable details (showing project ID and added date), and an "Edit Details" button.  The component also displays app promotion content and a chat list with several sample entries showing tutor information (name, rating, message, price, and verification status).  Finally, it includes a section to invite more tutors. An `UploadFiles` component is used for file uploads.

The second entry (2:09:02 PM) completely removes all code from the `ProjectDetails.js` file, suggesting a complete deletion or accidental overwrite of the component.


**`Auction.js` (May 5, 2025, 2:14:51 PM):** This file contains a `Auction` component displaying a progress tracker for project stages,  an explanation of annotated bibliographies, and the main content area showing information about a project's auction status.  The UI elements include illustrations, text descriptions, and a section to promote project visibility for more bids. It also features a referral section, encouraging users to share the platform and includes social media icons for sharing. The component utilizes a `TutorCard` component (which seems defined elsewhere, potentially in `ExpertCard.js`) for displaying tutor information. The sorting functionality allows the user to sort tutors by relevance and price.  The code also handles closing of a sort modal when a click occurs outside the modal.



The changes highlight a significant disruption in the development process, as evidenced by the complete removal of all code in `ProjectDetails.js` after the initial creation.  The `Auction.js` file showcases a more stable and feature-rich component.  There's a consistent use of styled components and inline styles, utilizing Tailwind CSS-like syntax within the JSX.  Both components extensively use the `Image` component from `next/image`.


## 3:17:51 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `invoice.controller.js` file between 2:28 PM and 3:10 PM on May 5th, 2025, primarily focused on refining the invoice generation and PDF functionality.  There are no changes after 3:10 PM.  The code consistently handles invoice creation, retrieval (by ID and order ID), and download as PDF.  The `COMPANY_DETAILS` object remains unchanged throughout, suggesting a potential area for improvement by moving this data to a configuration file or database.  The `downloadInvoice` function was initially incomplete (only comments) but became fully functional by the final revision.  The final version of `invoice.controller.js` includes a `generateInvoicePDF` function which creates a PDF invoice with company and customer details, a table for items, and a summary.  Between 3:15PM and 3:17PM the `InvoiceModal.jsx` file was updated to include more robust form validation and added a button to preview the invoice.  Finally, at 3:10:24 PM the `invoice.routes.js` file was updated to include a new route for invoice preview.  The `OrderDetail.jsx` file was updated at 3:16:31 PM to incorporate the new invoice preview functionality.
