# Activity Summary for 5/29/2025

## 12:35:40 AM
The log shows updates to two files within the `LMS_frontend` directory of a GitHub repository.  The most significant changes occurred on May 28th, 2025, between approximately 11:40 PM and 11:43 PM.


`DisplayCards.jsx` (11:40:45 PM): This file underwent a substantial update, adding features to display course cards. Key changes include:

*   Implementation of pagination for course cards, displaying 6 items per page.
*   Addition of a popup modal prompting users to register if they are not logged in before enrolling in a course.
*   Inclusion of a detailed view modal showing course information like description, duration, mode, price, teacher details, and student enrollment range.  The modal uses icons from `lucide-react`.
*   Robust error handling throughout the component, particularly when dealing with potentially null or undefined values from the `courses` prop. This is evident in functions like `getTeacherName`, `safeCourses`, and `highlightSearchTerm`.
*   Filtering functionality: Courses are filtered based on search terms, active category (All Courses, Free Courses, Paid Courses, Online Courses, Offline Courses), and public status.
*   Search term highlighting within the course descriptions and names using a regular expression.
*   Conditional rendering based on the existence of courses and search results, and display of appropriate messaging if no courses are found for the active category.


`DemoCards.js` (11:42:48 PM and 11:42:58 PM): This file also received updates related to course card display, but focused on demo courses. Key features include:

*   Added filtering by course mode ('Online', 'Offline', 'All') and branch (for offline courses only).  These filters reset the current page to 0 when changed.
*   The component retrieves unique branch names from the offline courses for the branch filter.
*   Use of `lucide-react` and `next/image` components for icons and image handling.
*   A function `getImageUrl` checks for valid image URLs and handles missing or invalid thumbnails.
*   A function `getAllTeacherNames` handles the case where a course may have a single teacher or an array of teachers.
*   Responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes for different screen sizes (mobile and desktop).
*   A significant code deletion (11:42:58 PM entry) which removed almost the entirety of the component’s functionality, suggesting a potential rollback or temporary removal.  The subsequent commit likely restored the original version with additional features.


Recurring elements: Both files extensively use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`),  Tailwind CSS for styling, and handle course display with pagination.  Both also incorporate robust error handling and search term highlighting.  The use of `lucide-react` icons is also consistent.  The difference is in the data they display and the filtering options available.  `DisplayCards.jsx` focuses on a wider range of courses and course details, while `DemoCards.js` concentrates on demo courses and filtering based on mode and branch.


## 10:39:15 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `GeoByJourno.js` and `Skribe365Home.jsx`.  The changes primarily focus on fetching and displaying data.

`GeoByJourno.js` underwent two revisions within a minute (9:56:56 AM and 9:57:11 AM). The primary change was the removal of commented-out code, resulting in a cleaner, functional component for displaying journalist data with filters and a "Load more" functionality.  The component uses props for data handling, including filtering and checkbox selection.

`Skribe365Home.jsx` underwent several revisions between 10:06:42 AM and 10:36:51 AM.  These changes involved significant improvements to the data fetching mechanism.  Initially, the component fetched data without pagination.  Later revisions implemented pagination using `nextPageToken` for loading more articles and added error handling.  The data fetched is processed and grouped by `primaryBeat` before display.  A `ReadMore` component is used to handle article descriptions.  The most significant changes involved correctly handling the `token` parameter in the API URL to fetch paginated data.  This fixes the way the URL is constructed, ensuring the `token` is properly appended, regardless of whether the base URL already contains query parameters. The final version uses `encodeURIComponent` to safely handle the token in the URL.

A common pattern in both files is the use of  `userService.get` for API calls and the extensive use of inline styling with Tailwind CSS. Both components also use a `generateUUID` function.  There is a consistent use of loading indicators (`Skeleton` component) for improved user experience during data retrieval.


## 11:39:14 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `Skribe365Home.jsx`, a React component likely displaying Skribe 365 articles.  The primary changes revolve around pagination and UI improvements.

The initial revisions (10:54:55 AM, 10:56:38 AM, 10:57:10 AM, 10:57:29 AM)  primarily involve code cleanup and minor UI adjustments.  Specifically, the  `10:57:10 AM` revision adds a red border (`border border-red-500`) to a div for debugging purposes. This was then removed in later versions.

The most significant change occurs at 11:05:48 AM.  This revision introduces pagination functionality.  New state variables (`loadingMore`, `nextPageToken`, `hasMore`) are added to manage loading and fetching subsequent pages of articles. The `fetchData` function is updated to handle pagination tokens. A "Load more" button is added to the UI, allowing users to load additional articles. The keys for the article rendering elements were updated to include unique identifiers, likely to improve React's performance.

The final revision (11:07:37 AM and 11:10:05 AM) appears to be a reversion to the previous version, possibly due to an error.  The changes introduced in the 11:05:48 AM revision are again present in the final version indicating some form of code debugging and rollback to the working pagination implementation.  The commented-out sections are consistently present across all revisions, suggesting they might be remnants from previous iterations or experimental code.  Throughout the updates, the core functionality of fetching and displaying articles from a service (`userService.get(SKRIBE365)`) remains consistent.


## 12:39:12 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `Skribe365Home.jsx` between 12:00 PM and 12:01 PM on May 29, 2025.  The changes are minor and primarily focus on styling within the React component.  Specifically, a style update is made to the "Load more" button in the last commit, changing the text color from the implicit default to `text-white` at 12:01:19 PM.  The core functionality of fetching and displaying articles remains unchanged across all commits.  The component fetches data using `userService.get`, handles pagination, and displays articles grouped by `primaryBeat`.  A `generateUUID` function is also present, suggesting some form of tracking is implemented.  No significant functional changes are observed across the commits; only a minor cosmetic change to the button's styling is made.


## 2:39:14 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `Sidebar.js`, a React component, all within a short time frame on May 29, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout:  rendering a sidebar navigation menu with sections ("Discovery," "Regional Media," "Press Release," "Brand," "Social," "Campaigns," "Resources," "Insights"). Each section can expand to show sub-items.

The changes primarily involve the `sections` array:

* **2:28:00 PM:** Initial version of the code. The "Regional Media" section has one item with a link to "X".  The "Outlet" and "Beats" items under "Discovery" are commented out.
* **2:28:49 PM:**  A minor change within the "Regional Media" section occurs. The item name ("X") is removed.  All other parts of the code remain unchanged.

* **2:29:01 PM:** The "Regional Media" section's item is removed entirely ( `items: []` ).

* **2:31:37 PM:** An item with the name "Brand Story" and link "X" is added to the "Regional Media" section.


* **2:36:38 PM:** The final revision corrects the link for the "Brand Story" item in the "Regional Media" section to "brand-story".

Throughout the revisions, the structure of the sidebar and its interactions with Redux actions (`sidebarMenu`, `mobileMenu`) and other components (`MenuData`, `HeaderLock`, `usePopup`) remain unchanged. The consistent use of  `material-icons-outlined` for icons is also noticeable.  The commented-out code suggests potential future features or elements that were temporarily removed from the current iteration.  There is also conditional rendering based on user role (`roleType`) and a feature lock implemented for the "Brand" section for users with the "Freebies" role.


## 3:39:24 PM
The log shows significant changes to the `BrandStory.jsx` and `AppRoutes.js` files, along with a smaller update to `UserAuthCheck.js` and `Sidebar.js` files.

The `BrandStory.jsx` component underwent several revisions between 2:41 PM and 2:49 PM.  Initially a simple "Brand Story Page" placeholder, it was briefly modified to contain repeated instances of "Brand Story Page hsdggggf", before reverting back to the original placeholder. This suggests a brief period of experimentation or accidental modification. A final, more substantial change occurred between 3:00 PM and 3:38 PM. The component was significantly altered to display a styled component using React's JSX. This includes styling with Tailwind CSS, text, headings, and image elements. The final version showcases two cards –  "Transparent Distribution" and "Organic Look Distribution", each with a list of features and an "Explore" button.  Numerous minor adjustments to styling and text were made during this period.

`AppRoutes.js` was updated multiple times between 2:43 PM and 2:53 PM. The most notable change involves numerous components being imported using React's `lazy` function for code-splitting.  Many components appear to be related to campaigns, media, geo-location data, social media, account settings, and reporting. Some commented-out code suggests a possible refactoring or removal of features during this time.  The final update at 2:53 PM modified the import path of the `BrandStory` component, reflecting the move from the `GEO/Regional` directory to the `PressRelease` directory.

The `UserAuthCheck.js` file received a single update at 2:44 PM, adding authorization logic using a token from localStorage and a custom `checkRole` function.  This component seems to control user access based on roles and redirects as necessary.

The `Sidebar.js` file was updated at 2:50 PM. The change includes the addition of a complex sidebar navigation component with React Router links, Redux integration for managing menu state, and conditional rendering based on user roles.


In summary, the log primarily reflects the development of a new "Brand Story" page and its integration into the navigation system.  The `AppRoutes.js` updates reveal a large-scale application featuring various modules and a significant effort in refactoring and code optimization. The consistent use of React, React Router, Redux, and Tailwind CSS are recurring elements, showcasing the technology stack used in the project.


## 4:39:19 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `BrandStory.js` between 3:41 PM and 4:30 PM on May 29, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is styling and layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS.

Initially, the component rendered two cards describing "Transparent Distribution" and "Organic Look Distribution," each with a features list and an "Explore" button.

Early revisions (3:41 PM - 3:45 PM) involved primarily altering the styling of text sizes (h1, p, h2 elements) and border-radius of the cards (`rounded-lg` changed to `rounded-[20px]`).  The opacity of some text was also adjusted using `text-[#00000080]`.

Between 3:45 PM and 3:59 PM, significant changes focused on refactoring the component's layout and responsiveness.  `max-h` was added to the cards to control their height, and later removed in favour of `min-h` for better responsiveness across different screen sizes.  `justify-between` was added in one revision, implying attempts to better align elements within the cards.  The "Explore" button's positioning was also adjusted (`mt-auto`) to dynamically position it at the bottom of the card.

Finally, from 3:59 PM onwards, a substantial restructuring occurred.  The code was extensively modified to incorporate more Tailwind CSS classes for improved responsiveness across different screen sizes (using `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` breakpoints). The overall structure transitioned to a more flexible design with  `flex flex-col` applied to the cards for better vertical alignment of content.  Padding and margins were adjusted (`p-6` to `p-4 sm:p-6`, etc.) to create better spacing. The final version, at 4:30 PM, features a more refined and responsive design, with consistent styling across different screen sizes.  One revision around 4:08 PM temporarily commented out the entire component before being replaced with the improved version.  This might suggest a temporary rollback or a different approach before arriving at the final code.


## 5:39:11 PM
On May 29, 2025, at 4:41:01 PM, the `BrandStory.js` component was updated.  The changes involved styling and content updates to a React component that presents two brand story distribution options: "Transparent Distribution" (with disclaimer) and "Organic Look Distribution" (without disclaimer).  Each option is visually represented with a card containing a headline, description, and a list of benefits presented as check-marked items using consistent styling (blue and white background, icons). The styling heavily uses Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design and visual elements.  The component uses consistent color schemes (#FAC540, #318FFF, #01438D) and icons (`/assets/whitetick.svg`, `/assets/bluetick.svg`) throughout.
