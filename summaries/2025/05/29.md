# Activity Summary for 5/29/2025

## 12:35:40 AM
The log shows updates to two files within the `LMS_frontend` directory of a GitHub repository.  The most significant changes occurred on May 28th, 2025, between approximately 11:40 PM and 11:43 PM.


`DisplayCards.jsx` (11:40:45 PM): This file underwent a substantial update, adding features to display course cards. Key changes include:

*   Implementation of pagination for course cards, displaying 6 items per page.
*   Addition of a popup modal prompting users to register if they are not logged in before enrolling in a course.
*   Inclusion of a detailed view modal showing course information like description, duration, mode, price, teacher details, and student enrollment range.  The modal uses icons from `lucide-react`.
*   Robust error handling throughout the component, particularly when dealing with potentially null or undefined values from the `courses` prop. This is evident in functions like `getTeacherName`, `safeCourses`, and `highlightSearchTerm`.
*   Filtering functionality: Courses are filtered based on search terms, active category (All Courses, Free Courses, Paid Courses, Online Courses, Offline Courses), and public status.
*   Search term highlighting within the course descriptions and names using a regular expression.
*   Conditional rendering based on the existence of courses and search results, and display of appropriate messaging if no courses are found for the active category.


`DemoCards.js` (11:42:48 PM and 11:42:58 PM): This file also received updates related to course card display, but focused on demo courses. Key features include:

*   Added filtering by course mode ('Online', 'Offline', 'All') and branch (for offline courses only).  These filters reset the current page to 0 when changed.
*   The component retrieves unique branch names from the offline courses for the branch filter.
*   Use of `lucide-react` and `next/image` components for icons and image handling.
*   A function `getImageUrl` checks for valid image URLs and handles missing or invalid thumbnails.
*   A function `getAllTeacherNames` handles the case where a course may have a single teacher or an array of teachers.
*   Responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes for different screen sizes (mobile and desktop).
*   A significant code deletion (11:42:58 PM entry) which removed almost the entirety of the componentâ€™s functionality, suggesting a potential rollback or temporary removal.  The subsequent commit likely restored the original version with additional features.


Recurring elements: Both files extensively use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`),  Tailwind CSS for styling, and handle course display with pagination.  Both also incorporate robust error handling and search term highlighting.  The use of `lucide-react` icons is also consistent.  The difference is in the data they display and the filtering options available.  `DisplayCards.jsx` focuses on a wider range of courses and course details, while `DemoCards.js` concentrates on demo courses and filtering based on mode and branch.


## 10:39:15 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `GeoByJourno.js` and `Skribe365Home.jsx`.  The changes primarily focus on fetching and displaying data.

`GeoByJourno.js` underwent two revisions within a minute (9:56:56 AM and 9:57:11 AM). The primary change was the removal of commented-out code, resulting in a cleaner, functional component for displaying journalist data with filters and a "Load more" functionality.  The component uses props for data handling, including filtering and checkbox selection.

`Skribe365Home.jsx` underwent several revisions between 10:06:42 AM and 10:36:51 AM.  These changes involved significant improvements to the data fetching mechanism.  Initially, the component fetched data without pagination.  Later revisions implemented pagination using `nextPageToken` for loading more articles and added error handling.  The data fetched is processed and grouped by `primaryBeat` before display.  A `ReadMore` component is used to handle article descriptions.  The most significant changes involved correctly handling the `token` parameter in the API URL to fetch paginated data.  This fixes the way the URL is constructed, ensuring the `token` is properly appended, regardless of whether the base URL already contains query parameters. The final version uses `encodeURIComponent` to safely handle the token in the URL.

A common pattern in both files is the use of  `userService.get` for API calls and the extensive use of inline styling with Tailwind CSS. Both components also use a `generateUUID` function.  There is a consistent use of loading indicators (`Skeleton` component) for improved user experience during data retrieval.
