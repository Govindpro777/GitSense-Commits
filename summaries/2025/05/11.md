# Activity Summary for 5/11/2025

## 12:23:32 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `Login.jsx` component, primarily focusing on UI improvements and minor functional adjustments.  Early revisions (11:32 PM, 11:33 PM, and 11:35 PM) involve significant restructuring of the component's layout and styling, shifting from a simpler structure to a more sophisticated design with improved responsiveness and dark mode support. The changes include updates to class names, addition of new elements (password visibility toggle), and the removal of commented-out code.  The core login functionality remains largely consistent, using `useLoginMutation` for API calls and `react-redux` for state management.


Later revisions to `Login.jsx` (12:11 AM, 12:14 AM, 12:15 AM, and 12:16 AM) continue to refine the styling and presentation.  Specifically, there's a focus on improving the visual appeal of the login form, the loader placement during processing, and the addition of `required` attributes to the input fields.  The core functionality remains unchanged.



`Navbar.jsx` (11:42 PM) shows the creation of a navigation bar component which includes a dark mode toggle, user profile display, and a notification sidebar.


`Navigation.jsx` (11:47 PM) shows the creation of a navigation component, but it is completely commented out.


The `App.jsx` file undergoes several modifications (11:50 PM, 11:51 PM, 11:57 PM, 12:00 AM, 12:00 AM, 12:02 AM, 12:04 AM, 12:05 AM).  These changes primarily concern the layout and conditional rendering of the navigation components (`Navigation` and `RetailerNav`) based on user roles ("Admin" and "Buyer"). Early versions show commented-out and incomplete code, evolving towards a more robust implementation.  The most significant change is the introduction of conditional rendering to manage the sidebar visibility based on user role and screen size, creating a better user experience on larger screens.  The redirect logic based on user authentication status and role is also refined throughout the revisions. The addition of a registration success redirect path is included in one of the later versions.  The final revision at 12:05 AM shows a fully functional approach to conditional rendering of the sidebar and a improved layout.


## 1:23:35 AM
The log shows significant changes to the `Loader.jsx` component, evolving through several iterations between 12:23 AM and 12:31 AM on May 11, 2025.  Initially, a simple spinning div was used. This was then replaced with an SVG spinner, with minor updates to class name handling (using `cn` utility and template literals). Subsequently, the component was reworked to utilize inline styles and finally, a third-party component, `FadeLoader` from `react-spinners`, was integrated.  The height of the `FadeLoader` was also adjusted slightly in the final two commits.  The color remained consistently `#3498db` throughout the `FadeLoader` implementations.


The `AdminDashboard.jsx` file underwent numerous changes between 12:35 AM and 12:56 AM. These changes primarily involved commenting out a large section of commented-out code (commented out code has been removed from this summary to avoid redundancy).  The file appears to be a React component rendering an admin dashboard, fetching data and displaying statistics related to orders and customers.  There's no clear pattern in these revisions besides the initial large comment block.


The `App.jsx` file was modified between 12:36 AM and 12:48 AM.  These updates mainly focused on refactoring the layout of the application, which included a transition from a commented out version to a version with a more structured layout using flexbox for better responsiveness.  There's a noticeable improvement in the structure and conditional rendering of navigation components (Sidebar, Navbar, RetailerNav, and Footer) based on user roles and the current route, improving the user experience.


Changes to `Navbar.jsx` occurred between 12:37 AM and 1:20 AM. These changes involved adding props for `activeMenuItem`, dynamically displaying the active menu item, adding margin to the right side, improving responsiveness using Tailwind CSS utility classes and slightly refining the styling and layout. A notification sidebar is conditionally rendered based on the user's role.


The `Navigation.jsx` component saw updates at 1:09 AM and 1:20 AM.  The changes primarily consisted of commenting out a substantial portion of code and then uncommenting it. The file shows a navigation component supporting both admin and buyer roles with different menu items. A collapsing sidebar for buyers was implemented, with handling for click events outside the sidebar.


Finally, `AdminMenu.jsx` file was updated at 1:22 AM and 1:23 AM, these changes are minor cosmetic updates and do not affect the functionality of the component.  This file implements an admin menu with an animated toggle, conditional rendering based on user authorization, and uses `react-router-dom`'s `NavLink` for navigation.


## 12:08:57 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `UploadFiles.js` on May 11, 2025, between 11:43 AM and 12:06 PM, with no substantive code changes.  The code appears to represent a React component for displaying and managing uploaded files, featuring file uploads, a filterable list, and responsive design elements for different screen sizes. The component uses `next/image` for image display and manages file information including name, time, and size. There are tabs to switch between "All", "Your Files", and "Writer's File" views and filtering/sorting options.  The file upload functionality includes adding, removing, and displaying files.  No changes were made to the functionality.

A new file, `CreateNewProject.js`, appears at 12:07:41 PM. This React component is for creating and editing projects. It includes a form with fields for project title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type, specific writer selection, word count, and file upload.  The component uses the `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/dates` libraries for UI elements, `lucide-react` for icons, `axiosInstance` for API calls, `sonner` for toasts, and `next/navigation` for routing.  It fetches subject categories from localStorage, handles file uploads via an API call, and submits the project data to the API, either creating a new project or updating an existing one based on a URL parameter.  The component also manages state for loading, edit mode, and error handling.  The `typeOptions` constant defines a comprehensive list of project types.


## 1:34:47 PM
The log shows several React component updates related to project creation and management within a frontend application.  Significant changes occurred between 12:10 PM and 12:43 PM on May 11, 2025.

`InviteModal.js` underwent two minor revisions.  The first change (12:13 PM) added conditional rendering of the "Invite Tutors" button, showing it only if `orderType` is 'self'.  The second change (12:14 PM) further refined this, rendering a simple button if `orderType` is not 'self', effectively disabling tutor invitation in certain project types.  The component consistently uses Next.js's `Link` component for navigation and displays SVG icons.

`ProjectDetails.js` (12:10 PM) is a substantial component handling project details, including fetching data via `axiosInstance`, updating the project details, managing file uploads using FormData,  and conditional rendering based on loading state and edit mode. It uses several external libraries: `lucide-react`, `next/image`, `sonner`, `@/lib/authContext`, `js-cookie`, `next/navigation`, and `@mantine/dates`.  The component fetches project details using a JWT token and user ID obtained from cookies or context.  The code also handles file uploads and updates.

`InviteTutors.js` had several revisions, ultimately resulting in the component being completely commented out (12:22 PM) and replaced by another version of the `InviteExpert` component. This new version uses `axiosInstance` to fetch tutor data, adding search and sorting functionality, and rendering tutor information using a custom `TutorCard` component.  It uses a substantial amount of logic to display the tutors with various criteria and options for sorting.  The earlier version of `InviteTutors.js` (12:17 PM) was a simpler implementation displaying mock tutor data.

`CreateNewProject.js`  underwent multiple revisions between 12:29 PM and 12:43 PM, primarily focused on expanding project type options within the `typeOptions` object.  This component handles project creation and editing, making API calls to `/api/homework/create` and `/api/homework/{homeworkId}` respectively. The component uses a similar structure to `ProjectDetails.js` for API calls and error handling, heavily relying on `axiosInstance`, `useAuth`, `Cookies`, and `next/navigation` libraries. There is significant logic to handle both creation and update of projects, including file uploads.  The handling of edit mode is consistently implemented across multiple useEffect hooks.

A recurring pattern across all components is the extensive use of  `axiosInstance` for API interactions, `useAuth` and `Cookies` for authentication, and the consistent use of `toast` for user feedback.  The components also demonstrate a consistent design pattern using Tailwind CSS for styling and Next.js features like `Image` and `Link` components for image display and navigation.
