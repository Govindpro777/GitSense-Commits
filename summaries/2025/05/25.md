# Activity Summary for 5/25/2025

## 12:28:56 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components used in a project-related landing page.  The primary components involved are `InviteExpertCard.js` and `InviteTutors.js`, both heavily reliant on API calls using `axiosInstance` for fetching and manipulating tutor data.  `ExpertCard.js` underwent significant changes around midday (12:16 PM - 12:19 PM).

`InviteExpertCard.js` was updated twice within a short time frame (11:48 AM and 11:49 AM). These changes primarily involved the addition of  MobileView for improved responsiveness.  The code displays tutor information (name, image, badges, rating, bio), and includes an "Invite" button that interacts with an API endpoint (`/api/homework/{homeworkId}/invite/{tutor.id}`) using JWT authentication.  The updates enhanced the card's appearance and functionality on mobile devices.

`InviteTutors.js` saw three revisions (11:49 AM, 11:55 AM, and 11:58 AM).  This component handles fetching tutors based on subject, search functionality, and sorting options.  It uses cookies (`project_form_data`) to store and retrieve project subject data, falling back to props if available.  The component makes use of `axiosInstance` to fetch tutor data from `/tutor/search/by-subject` and includes error handling with fallback to mock data.  All three revisions appear to be commented-out code, suggesting ongoing development or potential refactoring.

`ExpertCard.js`  underwent substantial changes between 12:16 PM and 12:19 PM.  These modifications added significant functionality:
*   The component now displays a "Best offer" indicator.
*   Modals for reviewing best offers and requesting prices were implemented.
*   A new `handleRequestPrice` function was introduced to handle price requests to the API endpoint `/api/bids/order/bid/request-price` and uses JWT authentication.
*   Tutor headlines are now truncated and expandable.
*   The component uses `react-icons` for heart icons and includes favorite handling.

The overall pattern in the code changes indicates a focus on refining user interface elements for mobile responsiveness and enriching the interaction with tutor profiles through API calls and enhanced user feedback mechanisms.  The use of JWT authentication is consistent across all components.  There's also a noticeable use of conditional rendering and responsive design techniques (CSS classes for different screen sizes). The commented-out code in `InviteTutors.js` suggests iterative development and debugging, whereas the frequent changes in `ExpertCard.js` reflect a more substantial feature addition.
