# Activity Summary for 5/1/2025

## 12:33:02 AM
The log shows multiple updates to frontend and backend components between April 30th, 2025 and May 1st, 2025.  The frontend changes primarily involve `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` and `UploadedFilesModal.jsx`.

**`OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Admin Order):** This component underwent numerous revisions,  all focusing on enhancing order details display and order management features.  Key improvements include:

* **File Data Handling:** The component now fetches and displays file data associated with an order (`fetchFileData`).  This involved adding state variables for file data and loading states and handling errors during the file fetching process.  There are also functions to download files, indicating a feature for retrieving associated order documents.

* **Cutout User Assignment:**  Significant changes were made to facilitate assigning orders to "Cutout" users.  Functions such as `fetchCutoutUsers` and `handleAssignOrder` were added to retrieve a list of Cutout users and to handle the assignment process via API calls to `/api/v1/admin/cutout/assignOrder/`.  The API endpoint changed over several commits. Error handling and success messages via `react-hot-toast` were implemented.

* **Order Status Updates:** A `handleStatusUpdate` function was added to allow updating an order's status through API calls to `/api/v1/admin/updateOrder/`. This uses a FormData object and refreshes the page upon successful update.  The function also handles various order statuses (New, InProgress, PendingApproval, Approved, Completed, Billed, Paid) with corresponding colors and icons.

The numerous minor updates to `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` after 12:00 AM on May 1st suggest minor bug fixes or refinements to the existing code.


**`UploadedFilesModal.jsx` (Graphics Order):**  This component was refactored multiple times. Initially, it was commented out. Then it was progressively developed to:

* **Fetch and Display Files:** The component is designed to display uploaded files (images and CAD files). The `fetchFilesData` function retrieves this data via a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/cutout/getCadFilesAndPhoto`. It handles potential errors and displays appropriate messages if no files are found.  Later commits added functionality to handle "textFiles".

* **File Deletion:**  The component includes functionality to delete files (`handleDeleteFile` and `confirmDeleteFile`), with a confirmation modal and error handling.  The API endpoint used is `/api/v1/admin/grpahics/deleteCadFile`.


**`user.routes.js` (Backend - User Routes):** This file defines routes for user management.  The most notable update at 12:04:12 AM on May 1st involved adding routes for various user-related operations.  These include:

* Signup, login, user profile retrieval, password change, user retrieval, and user deletion.
* The use of middleware for authentication (`auth`) and super-admin privilege check (`isSuperAdmin`) is evident in the route definitions.


**`graphics.controller.js` (Backend - Graphics Controller):** This controller underwent substantial changes focusing on order creation and management for graphics-related tasks. The key features include:

* **Order Creation:**  A large, commented-out section shows an initial, simpler approach to order creation. The final version of `createOrder` uses transactions to handle order and work queue item creation simultaneously. It also features automatic assignment of orders to available Graphics users, file uploads (`localFileUpload`), and scheduling of order processing jobs using the Agenda library.  The function incorporates error handling and sends notifications upon successful order creation.

* **Helper Functions:** Several helper functions manage tasks like finding available Graphics users, calculating order priority, and estimating completion times, showcasing a more structured design.


**`cutout.controller.js` (Backend - Cutout Controller):** This controller handles order assignment and status updates for Cutout users.

* **Order Assignment:** The `assignOrderToCutout` function assigns orders to Cutout users based on provided parameters.  It includes detailed error handling and logging of changes using the Log model.
* **Status Updates:** The `changeStatus` function updates the order status and includes logic for automatic assignment to accounts when an order is marked as "cutout_completed," along with logging of status changes.


The overall pattern across the changes shows a focus on improving the user experience by providing more features (file management, order assignment, status updates) and enhancing error handling, user feedback and logging.  The use of asynchronous operations and transactions points to improved server-side robustness. The timeline suggests the development was iterative, with repeated refinements to the frontend and backend code.


## 1:32:57 AM
The log shows multiple updates to frontend and backend components related to order management.  The frontend changes primarily focus on `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Admin and Cutout versions) and `CutoutOrders.jsx`.  The backend modifications center around `autoCutout.controller.js`, `cutout.controller.js`, and `autoAccounts.controller.js`.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\AdminOrder\OrderDetailsModal.jsx`**: This file underwent many revisions between 12:35 AM and 1:23 AM.  The major change was the addition of a "Files" tab, enabling the display and download of associated order files (CAD, images, text). The updates also involved improved error handling and visual enhancements.  The `downloadFile` function was refined to handle different download types ("single", "all", "type").

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\CutoutOrder\CutoutOrderDetailsModal.jsx`**: This file was largely commented out throughout the log, suggesting a potential refactoring or temporary disabling of this component.  The commented-out code contains similar file download functionality to the `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`  component but with a different API prefix (`/api/v1/admin` vs `/api/v1`).


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\CutoutOrder.jsx`**: This component displays a list of Cutout orders, allowing for searching, filtering by status, and viewing order details.  A socket event listener (`useSocketEvents`) updates the order list in real-time when an admin makes changes, reflecting changes to order status. Status filtering and badges were added for visual clarity.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\autoCutout.controller.js`**: This backend controller handles the automatic assignment of orders to Cutout users.  The `assignOrderToCutOut` function was refined to improve the clarity of log messages  recorded for order assignments and status updates.  The function selects the Cutout user with the fewest incomplete orders.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\cutout.controller.js`**: This controller manages Cutout user interactions with orders. It includes functions for assigning orders to Cutout users, updating order statuses (`changeStatus`), fetching CAD files, and downloading files.  A significant modification improved the `changeStatus` function to handle the automatic assignment of completed orders to accounts users using `assignToAccounts`.  Log messages were also improved in this function for better traceability of status updates.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\autoAccounts.controller.js`**: This controller handles automatic order assignment to accounts users once a Cutout user completes their work. The core functionality involves finding the least busy Accounts user and assigning the completed order.  The log messages within this controller were updated to improve clarity.


A recurring theme across all files is the use of  `localStorage.getItem("token")` for authentication and the consistent use of `toast` notifications for user feedback.  The backend uses a `Log` model to record changes made to orders for audit purposes. The frontend and backend API calls are consistent in their structure and utilize similar mechanisms for handling errors and success scenarios. The timestamps indicate a concentrated effort on improving order management functionality over a short period.


## 9:38:39 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` between 1:36 AM and 1:38 AM on May 1st, 2025.  The code consistently manages order details, including fetching order data, assigning orders to cutout users, and updating order statuses.  There are no functional changes across the revisions; all edits appear to be stylistic or formatting changes within the JSX, with no impact on the underlying logic.  The file utilizes `axios` and `fetch` for API calls, always retrieving a token from `localStorage` for authorization.  The `handleStatusUpdate` function updates order status via a PUT request and then reloads the page. The `downloadFile` function provides functionality to download order files, handling various download scenarios. The UI uses `lucide-react` icons for visual representation of order status.


## 12:49:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `CreateNewOrder.jsx` component and the `websocketStatus.js` service, along with one revision to `useCustomers.jsx` and  `cutout.controller.js` and `order.controller.js`.  The changes span a period from 11:51 AM to 12:46 PM on May 1st, 2025.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\AdminOrder\CreateNewOrder.jsx`**: This file underwent several revisions, primarily focused on refining the display of customer and user information within the order creation form.  The most significant changes involved modifying how customer information (`name` and `email`) is displayed and handled in the `handleSelectCustomer` function. Initially, only the customer's name was used; later revisions included the email address, experimenting with different concatenation methods before settling on displaying the name and email separately.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\useCustomers.jsx`**: This custom hook was updated to fetch customer data using the `fetchCustomers` function, and  transforming the data to include a combined `name` field.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\service\websocketStatus.js`**: This service manages websocket notifications for order status changes.  Several iterations focused on improving the notification message clarity by adding parentheses around Order IDs and explicitly mentioning the user who changed the status. The addition of  `User.findById`  to retrieve the username shows an attempt to personalize the notification message. There are also multiple functions to handle different types of order updates, including status changes and general edits.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\cutout.controller.js`**: This controller handles order assignments to cutout users.  A significant update occurred around 12:32 PM, improving the logging of changes made during order assignments by capturing the previous user's name and role.  The changeStatus function manages updates to order status.  When updating to "cutout_completed", it calls an `assignToAccounts` function for further processing.



**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\order.controller.js`**: This controller handles order management operations. A series of updates from 12:34PM to 12:46PM focused on improving the `updateOrder` function. The changes include detailed logging of modifications made to order details (requirements, dimensions, assignedTo and status) and conditional logic for handling the transition to "cutout_pending" status, triggering the reassignment of order via `assignOrderToCutOut` function.


The overall pattern across the changes suggests a focus on enhancing user experience and improving data integrity through more informative notifications and detailed logging.  There's a clear progression towards more robust error handling and improved user feedback, particularly noticeable in the backend controllers.
