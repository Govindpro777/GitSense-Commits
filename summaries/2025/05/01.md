# Activity Summary for 5/1/2025

## 12:33:02 AM
The log shows multiple updates to frontend and backend components between April 30th, 2025 and May 1st, 2025.  The frontend changes primarily involve `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` and `UploadedFilesModal.jsx`.

**`OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Admin Order):** This component underwent numerous revisions,  all focusing on enhancing order details display and order management features.  Key improvements include:

* **File Data Handling:** The component now fetches and displays file data associated with an order (`fetchFileData`).  This involved adding state variables for file data and loading states and handling errors during the file fetching process.  There are also functions to download files, indicating a feature for retrieving associated order documents.

* **Cutout User Assignment:**  Significant changes were made to facilitate assigning orders to "Cutout" users.  Functions such as `fetchCutoutUsers` and `handleAssignOrder` were added to retrieve a list of Cutout users and to handle the assignment process via API calls to `/api/v1/admin/cutout/assignOrder/`.  The API endpoint changed over several commits. Error handling and success messages via `react-hot-toast` were implemented.

* **Order Status Updates:** A `handleStatusUpdate` function was added to allow updating an order's status through API calls to `/api/v1/admin/updateOrder/`. This uses a FormData object and refreshes the page upon successful update.  The function also handles various order statuses (New, InProgress, PendingApproval, Approved, Completed, Billed, Paid) with corresponding colors and icons.

The numerous minor updates to `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` after 12:00 AM on May 1st suggest minor bug fixes or refinements to the existing code.


**`UploadedFilesModal.jsx` (Graphics Order):**  This component was refactored multiple times. Initially, it was commented out. Then it was progressively developed to:

* **Fetch and Display Files:** The component is designed to display uploaded files (images and CAD files). The `fetchFilesData` function retrieves this data via a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/cutout/getCadFilesAndPhoto`. It handles potential errors and displays appropriate messages if no files are found.  Later commits added functionality to handle "textFiles".

* **File Deletion:**  The component includes functionality to delete files (`handleDeleteFile` and `confirmDeleteFile`), with a confirmation modal and error handling.  The API endpoint used is `/api/v1/admin/grpahics/deleteCadFile`.


**`user.routes.js` (Backend - User Routes):** This file defines routes for user management.  The most notable update at 12:04:12 AM on May 1st involved adding routes for various user-related operations.  These include:

* Signup, login, user profile retrieval, password change, user retrieval, and user deletion.
* The use of middleware for authentication (`auth`) and super-admin privilege check (`isSuperAdmin`) is evident in the route definitions.


**`graphics.controller.js` (Backend - Graphics Controller):** This controller underwent substantial changes focusing on order creation and management for graphics-related tasks. The key features include:

* **Order Creation:**  A large, commented-out section shows an initial, simpler approach to order creation. The final version of `createOrder` uses transactions to handle order and work queue item creation simultaneously. It also features automatic assignment of orders to available Graphics users, file uploads (`localFileUpload`), and scheduling of order processing jobs using the Agenda library.  The function incorporates error handling and sends notifications upon successful order creation.

* **Helper Functions:** Several helper functions manage tasks like finding available Graphics users, calculating order priority, and estimating completion times, showcasing a more structured design.


**`cutout.controller.js` (Backend - Cutout Controller):** This controller handles order assignment and status updates for Cutout users.

* **Order Assignment:** The `assignOrderToCutout` function assigns orders to Cutout users based on provided parameters.  It includes detailed error handling and logging of changes using the Log model.
* **Status Updates:** The `changeStatus` function updates the order status and includes logic for automatic assignment to accounts when an order is marked as "cutout_completed," along with logging of status changes.


The overall pattern across the changes shows a focus on improving the user experience by providing more features (file management, order assignment, status updates) and enhancing error handling, user feedback and logging.  The use of asynchronous operations and transactions points to improved server-side robustness. The timeline suggests the development was iterative, with repeated refinements to the frontend and backend code.
