# Activity Summary for 5/1/2025

## 12:33:02 AM
The log shows multiple updates to frontend and backend components between April 30th, 2025 and May 1st, 2025.  The frontend changes primarily involve `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` and `UploadedFilesModal.jsx`.

**`OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Admin Order):** This component underwent numerous revisions,  all focusing on enhancing order details display and order management features.  Key improvements include:

* **File Data Handling:** The component now fetches and displays file data associated with an order (`fetchFileData`).  This involved adding state variables for file data and loading states and handling errors during the file fetching process.  There are also functions to download files, indicating a feature for retrieving associated order documents.

* **Cutout User Assignment:**  Significant changes were made to facilitate assigning orders to "Cutout" users.  Functions such as `fetchCutoutUsers` and `handleAssignOrder` were added to retrieve a list of Cutout users and to handle the assignment process via API calls to `/api/v1/admin/cutout/assignOrder/`.  The API endpoint changed over several commits. Error handling and success messages via `react-hot-toast` were implemented.

* **Order Status Updates:** A `handleStatusUpdate` function was added to allow updating an order's status through API calls to `/api/v1/admin/updateOrder/`. This uses a FormData object and refreshes the page upon successful update.  The function also handles various order statuses (New, InProgress, PendingApproval, Approved, Completed, Billed, Paid) with corresponding colors and icons.

The numerous minor updates to `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` after 12:00 AM on May 1st suggest minor bug fixes or refinements to the existing code.


**`UploadedFilesModal.jsx` (Graphics Order):**  This component was refactored multiple times. Initially, it was commented out. Then it was progressively developed to:

* **Fetch and Display Files:** The component is designed to display uploaded files (images and CAD files). The `fetchFilesData` function retrieves this data via a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/cutout/getCadFilesAndPhoto`. It handles potential errors and displays appropriate messages if no files are found.  Later commits added functionality to handle "textFiles".

* **File Deletion:**  The component includes functionality to delete files (`handleDeleteFile` and `confirmDeleteFile`), with a confirmation modal and error handling.  The API endpoint used is `/api/v1/admin/grpahics/deleteCadFile`.


**`user.routes.js` (Backend - User Routes):** This file defines routes for user management.  The most notable update at 12:04:12 AM on May 1st involved adding routes for various user-related operations.  These include:

* Signup, login, user profile retrieval, password change, user retrieval, and user deletion.
* The use of middleware for authentication (`auth`) and super-admin privilege check (`isSuperAdmin`) is evident in the route definitions.


**`graphics.controller.js` (Backend - Graphics Controller):** This controller underwent substantial changes focusing on order creation and management for graphics-related tasks. The key features include:

* **Order Creation:**  A large, commented-out section shows an initial, simpler approach to order creation. The final version of `createOrder` uses transactions to handle order and work queue item creation simultaneously. It also features automatic assignment of orders to available Graphics users, file uploads (`localFileUpload`), and scheduling of order processing jobs using the Agenda library.  The function incorporates error handling and sends notifications upon successful order creation.

* **Helper Functions:** Several helper functions manage tasks like finding available Graphics users, calculating order priority, and estimating completion times, showcasing a more structured design.


**`cutout.controller.js` (Backend - Cutout Controller):** This controller handles order assignment and status updates for Cutout users.

* **Order Assignment:** The `assignOrderToCutout` function assigns orders to Cutout users based on provided parameters.  It includes detailed error handling and logging of changes using the Log model.
* **Status Updates:** The `changeStatus` function updates the order status and includes logic for automatic assignment to accounts when an order is marked as "cutout_completed," along with logging of status changes.


The overall pattern across the changes shows a focus on improving the user experience by providing more features (file management, order assignment, status updates) and enhancing error handling, user feedback and logging.  The use of asynchronous operations and transactions points to improved server-side robustness. The timeline suggests the development was iterative, with repeated refinements to the frontend and backend code.


## 1:32:57 AM
The log shows multiple updates to frontend and backend components related to order management.  The frontend changes primarily focus on `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Admin and Cutout versions) and `CutoutOrders.jsx`.  The backend modifications center around `autoCutout.controller.js`, `cutout.controller.js`, and `autoAccounts.controller.js`.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\AdminOrder\OrderDetailsModal.jsx`**: This file underwent many revisions between 12:35 AM and 1:23 AM.  The major change was the addition of a "Files" tab, enabling the display and download of associated order files (CAD, images, text). The updates also involved improved error handling and visual enhancements.  The `downloadFile` function was refined to handle different download types ("single", "all", "type").

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\CutoutOrder\CutoutOrderDetailsModal.jsx`**: This file was largely commented out throughout the log, suggesting a potential refactoring or temporary disabling of this component.  The commented-out code contains similar file download functionality to the `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`  component but with a different API prefix (`/api/v1/admin` vs `/api/v1`).


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\CutoutOrder.jsx`**: This component displays a list of Cutout orders, allowing for searching, filtering by status, and viewing order details.  A socket event listener (`useSocketEvents`) updates the order list in real-time when an admin makes changes, reflecting changes to order status. Status filtering and badges were added for visual clarity.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\autoCutout.controller.js`**: This backend controller handles the automatic assignment of orders to Cutout users.  The `assignOrderToCutOut` function was refined to improve the clarity of log messages  recorded for order assignments and status updates.  The function selects the Cutout user with the fewest incomplete orders.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\cutout.controller.js`**: This controller manages Cutout user interactions with orders. It includes functions for assigning orders to Cutout users, updating order statuses (`changeStatus`), fetching CAD files, and downloading files.  A significant modification improved the `changeStatus` function to handle the automatic assignment of completed orders to accounts users using `assignToAccounts`.  Log messages were also improved in this function for better traceability of status updates.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\autoAccounts.controller.js`**: This controller handles automatic order assignment to accounts users once a Cutout user completes their work. The core functionality involves finding the least busy Accounts user and assigning the completed order.  The log messages within this controller were updated to improve clarity.


A recurring theme across all files is the use of  `localStorage.getItem("token")` for authentication and the consistent use of `toast` notifications for user feedback.  The backend uses a `Log` model to record changes made to orders for audit purposes. The frontend and backend API calls are consistent in their structure and utilize similar mechanisms for handling errors and success scenarios. The timestamps indicate a concentrated effort on improving order management functionality over a short period.
