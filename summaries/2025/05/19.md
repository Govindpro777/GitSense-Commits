# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 12:12:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `WelcomePage.js` and one update to `HomeworkBanner.js` on May 18, 2025.  The `WelcomePage.js` file underwent several revisions within a short time frame (between 11:17 PM and 11:30 PM).  The content of these revisions appears to be largely the same, suggesting minor edits or debugging rather than substantial functional changes.  The code within `WelcomePage.js` is a React component with extensive state management using `useState` and several `useEffect` hooks for fetching data (likely subject categories and budget suggestions) and handling user interactions. It seems to be a modal for creating a new project, involving features like file uploads, budget calculation, and user authentication.

The `HomeworkBanner.js` file was updated twice, with minor changes between 11:27 PM and 11:27:31 PM. The changes relate to the `handleSubmit` function.  Initially, the project description was saved to cookies even if a user had a token, this was subsequently updated to only save if the user doesn't have a token, suggesting a refinement in the logic for handling logged-in and logged-out users. The component is a banner for homework help, featuring a form for project description and a toggle for selecting human experts.  The form submission redirects the user based on authentication statusâ€”either to a signup modal or to the user's orders page.  The use of cookies to store temporary project descriptions is evident.
