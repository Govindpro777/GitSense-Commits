# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 12:12:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `WelcomePage.js` and one update to `HomeworkBanner.js` on May 18, 2025.  The `WelcomePage.js` file underwent several revisions within a short time frame (between 11:17 PM and 11:30 PM).  The content of these revisions appears to be largely the same, suggesting minor edits or debugging rather than substantial functional changes.  The code within `WelcomePage.js` is a React component with extensive state management using `useState` and several `useEffect` hooks for fetching data (likely subject categories and budget suggestions) and handling user interactions. It seems to be a modal for creating a new project, involving features like file uploads, budget calculation, and user authentication.

The `HomeworkBanner.js` file was updated twice, with minor changes between 11:27 PM and 11:27:31 PM. The changes relate to the `handleSubmit` function.  Initially, the project description was saved to cookies even if a user had a token, this was subsequently updated to only save if the user doesn't have a token, suggesting a refinement in the logic for handling logged-in and logged-out users. The component is a banner for homework help, featuring a form for project description and a toggle for selecting human experts.  The form submission redirects the user based on authentication statusâ€”either to a signup modal or to the user's orders page.  The use of cookies to store temporary project descriptions is evident.


## 10:44:57 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `WelcomePage.js` on May 19th, 2025.  The code consists of a React component (`WelcomeModal`) handling user input for project details, including type, subject, word count, budget, and a description.  It fetches budget suggestions from an API endpoint (`/api/homework/budget-suggestion`) using `axiosInstance`.  The component uses cookies and local storage for storing and retrieving data like `projectDescription` and `subjectCategories`.

The changes between 9:51 AM and 9:52 AM appear to be insignificant, involving minor edits that don't alter the functionality.  A more substantial change occurred around 9:58 AM to 9:59 AM, and another between 10:03 AM and 10:08 AM, although the exact nature of these changes cannot be definitively determined from the provided commented-out code.  The code consistently utilizes a variety of React hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`), along with external libraries like `@mantine/dates`, `sonner`, `lucide-react`, `js-cookie`, and `next/link`.  The repeated identical code snippets suggest that these multiple commits might reflect the saving of intermediate development versions without substantive changes to the core logic.


## 11:44:57 AM
The provided log shows multiple updates to two React component files: `WelcomePage.js` and `CreateNewProject.js`, between 10:57 AM and 11:27 AM on May 19, 2025.  `WelcomePage.js` underwent numerous revisions, all appearing to be minor adjustments or comment changes,  without any significant functional alterations to the code.  There is no discernible pattern in these changes aside from the repetitive nature of the code itself across the timestamps.

`CreateNewProject.js`, on the other hand, shows more substantial changes, primarily adding functionality for file uploads and enhancing subject category management.  The changes include adding state variables (`selectedFile`, `fileName`, `fileResponse`, `subjectCategories`, `selectedCategory`, `subjects`, `selectedSubjectName`) and functions (`handleFileSelect`, `handleAttachClick`, `handleRemoveFile`, `uploadFile`, and relevant useEffect hooks) for handling file uploads and managing subject categories.  The component now uses cookies to store and retrieve form data, improving the user experience by persisting data across sessions.  The addition of error handling and loading indicators further enhances the robustness of the component.  The most significant changes to this file occurred around 11:03 AM. The component also now handles edit mode, fetching existing project data for updates using a provided homework ID.  The code efficiently manages this edit mode, loading existing data into the form and persisting changes to cookies.

Both components heavily rely on `axiosInstance` for API calls, `useAuth` for authentication context, and `Cookies` for client-side storage.  The `WelcomePage.js` component specifically interacts with an `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` endpoint, while `CreateNewProject.js` utilizes `/api/homework/:homeworkId` and potentially another endpoint for file uploads.


## 1:45:02 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `ExpertCard.js` component and the `page.jsx` file within the `homework/payment` directory of a React frontend application.  The changes span approximately 20 minutes on May 19, 2025.

`ExpertCard.js`:  The primary focus of the modifications in `ExpertCard.js` centers around enhancing the user interface, particularly the display of tutor information and interactive elements.  No core functionality changes are apparent across the multiple edits.  The component uses several state variables to manage modal displays (isModalOpen, isModalReview, bestOfferModal), and employs `useEffect` to handle clicks outside of the modals. A `TutorHeadline` component was added to handle the display and truncation of tutor headlines. The code consistently uses inline styles extensively for styling purposes.  Several imports were added and removed  (`export` was temporarily misplaced) during the edits and `useRouter` from `next/navigation` is added to enable navigation.


`homework/payment/page.jsx`:  This file underwent changes to incorporate query parameters from the URL.  Specifically, `useSearchParams` was used to extract `homeworkId` and `bidId` from the URL, which are then logged to the console.  This suggests the addition of routing to a payment page that dynamically handles different homework and bid IDs.  The main change was the introduction of the `useSearchParams` hook and extraction of parameters `homeworkId` and `bidId` to pass down to the `Payment` component (around 1:20 PM and 1:22 PM).

`Payment.js`:  The `Payment.js` component, displaying a payment summary, went through multiple iterations, mostly concerning commenting out the entire component body between 1:32 PM and 1:43 PM. The final revision restored the code; it is a complex component with multiple state variables to manage different sections' visibility and  payment method selection using React's state management. The component heavily uses inline styles.  The initial versions were missing the  `homeworkId` and `bidId` parameters in the function definition, but the final version still didn't use them.

In summary, the code changes demonstrate iterative development, with UI refinements in `ExpertCard.js`, and the crucial addition of dynamic URL parameter handling in `page.jsx` to pass information to the payment page which was initially fully commented out, then restored.  The consistent use of inline styles could be refactored for improved maintainability.
