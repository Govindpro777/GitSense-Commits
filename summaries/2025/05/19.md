# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 12:12:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `WelcomePage.js` and one update to `HomeworkBanner.js` on May 18, 2025.  The `WelcomePage.js` file underwent several revisions within a short time frame (between 11:17 PM and 11:30 PM).  The content of these revisions appears to be largely the same, suggesting minor edits or debugging rather than substantial functional changes.  The code within `WelcomePage.js` is a React component with extensive state management using `useState` and several `useEffect` hooks for fetching data (likely subject categories and budget suggestions) and handling user interactions. It seems to be a modal for creating a new project, involving features like file uploads, budget calculation, and user authentication.

The `HomeworkBanner.js` file was updated twice, with minor changes between 11:27 PM and 11:27:31 PM. The changes relate to the `handleSubmit` function.  Initially, the project description was saved to cookies even if a user had a token, this was subsequently updated to only save if the user doesn't have a token, suggesting a refinement in the logic for handling logged-in and logged-out users. The component is a banner for homework help, featuring a form for project description and a toggle for selecting human experts.  The form submission redirects the user based on authentication statusâ€”either to a signup modal or to the user's orders page.  The use of cookies to store temporary project descriptions is evident.

The log shows multiple revisions of `WelcomePage.js` on May 19th, 2025.  The code consists of a React component (`WelcomeModal`) handling user input for project details, including type, subject, word count, budget, and a description.  It fetches budget suggestions from an API endpoint (`/api/homework/budget-suggestion`) using `axiosInstance`.  The component uses cookies and local storage for storing and retrieving data like `projectDescription` and `subjectCategories`.

The changes between 9:51 AM and 9:52 AM appear to be insignificant, involving minor edits that don't alter the functionality.  A more substantial change occurred around 9:58 AM to 9:59 AM, and another between 10:03 AM and 10:08 AM, although the exact nature of these changes cannot be definitively determined from the provided commented-out code.  The code consistently utilizes a variety of React hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`), along with external libraries like `@mantine/dates`, `sonner`, `lucide-react`, `js-cookie`, and `next/link`.  The repeated identical code snippets suggest that these multiple commits might reflect the saving of intermediate development versions without substantive changes to the core logic.
