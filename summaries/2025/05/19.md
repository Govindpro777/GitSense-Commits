# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 12:12:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `WelcomePage.js` and one update to `HomeworkBanner.js` on May 18, 2025.  The `WelcomePage.js` file underwent several revisions within a short time frame (between 11:17 PM and 11:30 PM).  The content of these revisions appears to be largely the same, suggesting minor edits or debugging rather than substantial functional changes.  The code within `WelcomePage.js` is a React component with extensive state management using `useState` and several `useEffect` hooks for fetching data (likely subject categories and budget suggestions) and handling user interactions. It seems to be a modal for creating a new project, involving features like file uploads, budget calculation, and user authentication.

The `HomeworkBanner.js` file was updated twice, with minor changes between 11:27 PM and 11:27:31 PM. The changes relate to the `handleSubmit` function.  Initially, the project description was saved to cookies even if a user had a token, this was subsequently updated to only save if the user doesn't have a token, suggesting a refinement in the logic for handling logged-in and logged-out users. The component is a banner for homework help, featuring a form for project description and a toggle for selecting human experts.  The form submission redirects the user based on authentication status—either to a signup modal or to the user's orders page.  The use of cookies to store temporary project descriptions is evident.


## 10:44:57 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `WelcomePage.js` on May 19th, 2025.  The code consists of a React component (`WelcomeModal`) handling user input for project details, including type, subject, word count, budget, and a description.  It fetches budget suggestions from an API endpoint (`/api/homework/budget-suggestion`) using `axiosInstance`.  The component uses cookies and local storage for storing and retrieving data like `projectDescription` and `subjectCategories`.

The changes between 9:51 AM and 9:52 AM appear to be insignificant, involving minor edits that don't alter the functionality.  A more substantial change occurred around 9:58 AM to 9:59 AM, and another between 10:03 AM and 10:08 AM, although the exact nature of these changes cannot be definitively determined from the provided commented-out code.  The code consistently utilizes a variety of React hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`), along with external libraries like `@mantine/dates`, `sonner`, `lucide-react`, `js-cookie`, and `next/link`.  The repeated identical code snippets suggest that these multiple commits might reflect the saving of intermediate development versions without substantive changes to the core logic.


## 11:44:57 AM
The provided log shows multiple updates to two React component files: `WelcomePage.js` and `CreateNewProject.js`, between 10:57 AM and 11:27 AM on May 19, 2025.  `WelcomePage.js` underwent numerous revisions, all appearing to be minor adjustments or comment changes,  without any significant functional alterations to the code.  There is no discernible pattern in these changes aside from the repetitive nature of the code itself across the timestamps.

`CreateNewProject.js`, on the other hand, shows more substantial changes, primarily adding functionality for file uploads and enhancing subject category management.  The changes include adding state variables (`selectedFile`, `fileName`, `fileResponse`, `subjectCategories`, `selectedCategory`, `subjects`, `selectedSubjectName`) and functions (`handleFileSelect`, `handleAttachClick`, `handleRemoveFile`, `uploadFile`, and relevant useEffect hooks) for handling file uploads and managing subject categories.  The component now uses cookies to store and retrieve form data, improving the user experience by persisting data across sessions.  The addition of error handling and loading indicators further enhances the robustness of the component.  The most significant changes to this file occurred around 11:03 AM. The component also now handles edit mode, fetching existing project data for updates using a provided homework ID.  The code efficiently manages this edit mode, loading existing data into the form and persisting changes to cookies.

Both components heavily rely on `axiosInstance` for API calls, `useAuth` for authentication context, and `Cookies` for client-side storage.  The `WelcomePage.js` component specifically interacts with an `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` endpoint, while `CreateNewProject.js` utilizes `/api/homework/:homeworkId` and potentially another endpoint for file uploads.


## 1:45:02 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `ExpertCard.js` component and the `page.jsx` file within the `homework/payment` directory of a React frontend application.  The changes span approximately 20 minutes on May 19, 2025.

`ExpertCard.js`:  The primary focus of the modifications in `ExpertCard.js` centers around enhancing the user interface, particularly the display of tutor information and interactive elements.  No core functionality changes are apparent across the multiple edits.  The component uses several state variables to manage modal displays (isModalOpen, isModalReview, bestOfferModal), and employs `useEffect` to handle clicks outside of the modals. A `TutorHeadline` component was added to handle the display and truncation of tutor headlines. The code consistently uses inline styles extensively for styling purposes.  Several imports were added and removed  (`export` was temporarily misplaced) during the edits and `useRouter` from `next/navigation` is added to enable navigation.


`homework/payment/page.jsx`:  This file underwent changes to incorporate query parameters from the URL.  Specifically, `useSearchParams` was used to extract `homeworkId` and `bidId` from the URL, which are then logged to the console.  This suggests the addition of routing to a payment page that dynamically handles different homework and bid IDs.  The main change was the introduction of the `useSearchParams` hook and extraction of parameters `homeworkId` and `bidId` to pass down to the `Payment` component (around 1:20 PM and 1:22 PM).

`Payment.js`:  The `Payment.js` component, displaying a payment summary, went through multiple iterations, mostly concerning commenting out the entire component body between 1:32 PM and 1:43 PM. The final revision restored the code; it is a complex component with multiple state variables to manage different sections' visibility and  payment method selection using React's state management. The component heavily uses inline styles.  The initial versions were missing the  `homeworkId` and `bidId` parameters in the function definition, but the final version still didn't use them.

In summary, the code changes demonstrate iterative development, with UI refinements in `ExpertCard.js`, and the crucial addition of dynamic URL parameter handling in `page.jsx` to pass information to the payment page which was initially fully commented out, then restored.  The consistent use of inline styles could be refactored for improved maintainability.


## 3:10:33 PM
The log shows several modifications to React components within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project between 2:11 PM and 2:55 PM on May 19, 2025.  The most significant changes relate to the `Payment.js`, `ProjectWrapper.js`, and `ProjectPage.jsx` files.


`Payment.js` underwent multiple revisions, but the code content remained largely consistent across all updates.  It appears to be a React component for displaying a payment summary and options (card, PayPal, Stripe) with styling heavily reliant on Tailwind CSS.  There is no functional change observed in these commits.


`ProjectWrapper.js`  received updates between 2:48 PM and 2:52 PM.  These modifications focused on improving the loading indicator during data retrieval. Initially, a simple spinning div was used; this was later replaced with a more visually appealing `ClipLoader` from `react-spinners`, and the loading screen was adjusted to take the full screen height. The core functionality—checking for the existence of user projects via an API call (`/api/homework/student`) and conditionally rendering `ActiveProjects` or `MyProject` components—remained unchanged.  The use of `js-cookie` and `axiosInstance` for authentication and API calls is noteworthy.


`ProjectPage.jsx` was updated at 2:49 PM. The primary change involves replacing a direct rendering of the `MyProject` component with the `ProjectWrapper` component. This simplifies the component structure and centralizes project loading logic.


`ActiveProject.js` was modified several times between 2:53 PM and 2:55 PM. These changes seem to be related to styling and layout of the component, possibly  refactoring for responsiveness and improved UI elements.  The component uses `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/dates` for UI elements and contains extensive Tailwind CSS styling.  However, the code is commented-out, suggesting these commits might have been temporary or experimental.


`WelcomePage.js` shows two consecutive commits at 2:54 PM and 2:55 PM. The code appears to be for a welcome modal with form elements for project creation.  The code is entirely commented out. This suggests experimentation or temporary removal of this component from the application.



In summary, the majority of changes focused on UI improvements, specifically loading indicators and potentially component refactoring. The core logic for fetching and displaying project data remained largely unchanged throughout the period. The use of Tailwind CSS and various React libraries for styling and UI components is a recurring theme.


## 4:11:06 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `Payment.js`, a React component likely responsible for handling payment on a landing page.  The component renders a payment summary section, displaying expert information and payment options (full or partial payment, with Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, and Stripe options).  There are also tooltips showing more details about partial payments and processing fees.

The file underwent several iterations between 3:14 PM and 3:49 PM on May 19th, 2025.  A significant pattern is the repeated commenting-out and uncommenting of the entire component's code. This suggests a cyclical process of potentially experimenting with different versions or temporarily disabling the component.  The final version at 3:49 PM is commented out, indicating the component might have been disabled or removed completely in the final version.  The uncommented versions are largely consistent in structure and functionality throughout the edits, with only minor potential adjustments not visible from the provided snippets.


## 5:10:28 PM
The log shows React component code updates for a frontend application, specifically focusing on a landing page's "Project" section.  There are two components involved: `Payment.js` and `ActiveProject.js`.

`Payment.js` (5/19/2025, 4:50:19 PM): This component displays a payment summary and options for full or partial payment, along with various payment methods (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, Stripe).  It uses React state to manage payment type and method selection and includes responsive design elements using Tailwind CSS classes.  The code heavily utilizes images for visual elements.

`ActiveProject.js` (Multiple updates between 5/19/2025, 4:53:17 PM and 5/19/2025, 4:54:42 PM): This component renders a list of active projects, categorized using tabs ("All", "At the Auction", "In Process", "Under Warranty", "Completed"). It features a responsive design with a sidebar toggle for mobile and uses React state to manage active tabs, search functionality, and sidebar visibility.  The component uses `useEffect` hooks for dynamic updates to the tab indicator position,  based on screen resizing and scrolling within the tab container.  Multiple updates to this file suggest iterative improvements or bug fixes in a short time period.  The code uses Mantine UI and Lucide React libraries for UI components and icons. A common design pattern across both components is heavy usage of inline styles and images for visual elements.  The components appear to be visually consistent in their design language.


## 6:10:32 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `ActiveProject.js` between 5:19 PM and 5:29 PM,  with no discernible changes in content.  The code in `ActiveProject.js` appears to be a React component for displaying active projects, using features like tabs, image imports, and state management for search and sidebar functionality.  The sample `projectsData` suggests functionality for displaying projects in different states ('At the Auction', 'Drafts', 'Revision', etc.).


Between 5:25 PM and 6:06 PM, `BidTutorList.js` underwent several revisions.  This component fetches and displays a list of tutor bids for a given homework ID, using pagination and sorting options ('Most Relevant', 'Dates', 'Rating: Highest', etc.). It utilizes `axiosInstance` for API calls, `useAuth` for authentication, and `js-cookie` for cookie management. The component maps bid data to a consistent `TutorCard` format.  A significant change is the addition of a `Promotion` component.

Finally, there are edits to `Auction.js` between 6:03 PM and 6:06 PM. This component seems to render an auction page, integrating `BidTutorList`, `ProjectDetails`, and other components.  Notable modifications include removing the `Promotion` component from the main content area and conditionally rendering `TheAuction` and `InviteAndEarn` components based on the presence of tutor bids.  The component fetches project details and tutor bids via API calls, handling loading states and errors with `setIsLoading` and `toast`.
