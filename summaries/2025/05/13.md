# Activity Summary for 5/13/2025

## 12:50:27 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React components over a short period (May 12th and 13th, 2025).

`App.jsx` underwent significant restructuring of its layout.  Initial versions used commented-out code, suggesting iterative development. The final version includes a `Navbar` component, displayed consistently at the top, and conditional rendering of a sidebar (`Navigation`) and retailer-specific navigation (`RetailerNav`) and footer (`RetailerFooter`) based on user role.  The main content area (`Outlet`) is dynamically adjusted for sidebar visibility.  These changes happened between 11:53 PM and 12:04 AM on May 13th.

`BrandList.jsx` was updated to improve its UI. The earlier versions showed commented-out code, indicating a transition from using buttons to a more visually appealing card-based layout utilizing the `lucide-react` icon library.  The update adds edit and delete icons alongside brand names, making it more user-friendly.  These alterations occurred between 12:02 AM and 12:03 AM on May 13th.

`BrandForm.jsx` also received a UI update.  The styling was significantly improved, transitioning from a more basic layout to a cleaner and more modern design. This change happened around 12:10 AM on May 13th.  There were minor reversions/edits to the styling between 12:10 AM and 12:10:32 AM on May 13th.

`AdminNotification.jsx` had its layout updated from a simpler structure to one using Tailwind CSS for more sophisticated styling. The update enhanced the visual appeal and improved the overall user experience.  Multiple revisions occurred between 12:19 AM and 12:42 AM on May 13th.


`BugReports.jsx` saw several changes.  The most significant was a complete overhaul of its UI from a table layout to a more modern design using Tailwind CSS.  It includes a loading indicator (`Loader`) and error handling (`Message`).  A "no bug reports" message was added for improved empty state handling.  The component also incorporates socket.io for real-time updates.  This major update occurred primarily between 12:21 AM and 12:35 AM on May 13th.  Additional styling refinements followed afterwards.

`Navbar.jsx` was enhanced with a notification sidebar (`NotificationSidebar`), which is conditionally rendered for administrators. The user's profile picture/initial is displayed, and a dark mode toggle was removed.  The changes happened around 12:25 AM on May 13th.


`UserCartList.jsx` remained largely unchanged; only comments were added around 12:48 AM and 12:49 AM on May 13th.


The overall pattern indicates a focus on improving the user interface and user experience of the admin dashboard, leveraging Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and using React's functional components with hooks effectively.  There's also a trend of incorporating real-time updates using socket.io.


## 10:40:56 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to three React component files within a frontend project (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).  The most significant changes are in `InviteModal.js`, which underwent three revisions within a short time frame (between 9:57 AM and 10:02 AM).  These revisions focused on refining the modal's functionality related to inviting tutors. Initially, the `InviteModal` component lacked crucial error handling and conditional rendering based on the `orderType` prop.  The updates added a toast notification from the `sonner` library to inform the user when auto-matching cannot be used with invited experts.  The button behavior was also modified to reflect the error handling logic, changing its appearance (opacity and cursor) when auto-match is selected.  The final version removes the conditional rendering of a `<Link>` component, opting instead for a standard button with the toast notification in all cases where `orderType` is not 'self'.

`ProjectDetails.js` shows a single entry at 10:01:18 AM,  demonstrating a substantial component dealing with project details. This component handles fetching, displaying, and editing project information using features like file uploads, date picking, and conditional rendering. It uses `axiosInstance` for API calls and incorporates state management for form data, file uploads, and loading states.  The component interacts with a backend to fetch and update homework (`/api/homework`) and files (`/api/files/upload`).

`ExpertCard.js` has three revisions between 10:07 AM and 10:07 AM showing commented-out code.  The commented code suggests that the component initially included a modal explaining the payment process. This modal has been removed in subsequent commits, the reason for which isn't apparent from the logs.  The main component focuses on displaying detailed tutor information with responsive design adjustments for various screen sizes, showcasing tutor details, ratings, and actions like hiring or chatting. The code heavily uses inline styling and conditional rendering based on tutor properties.


## 11:31:03 AM
The codebase reflects a web application with both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js with Express) components.  Significant changes occurred around 10:36 AM, 10:59 AM, 11:01 AM, 11:06 AM, 11:08 AM, and 11:17 AM on May 13, 2025.

**M_Frontend (Navbar.jsx):**  The `Navbar.jsx` component was updated at 10:36 AM to include notification functionality.  This involved fetching notifications using axios, handling socket events ("message", "newNotification", "assignment") for real-time updates, displaying unread notification counts, and implementing pagination for loading more notifications.  The component utilizes `react-router-dom`, `@heroicons/react`, `axios`, `react-hot-toast`, and `moment` libraries. The navbar also includes elements for toggling a sidebar, displaying socket connection status, and accessing settings.

**M_Backend:** Several backend files were modified between 10:59 AM and 11:08 AM, all related to a "Challan" (likely an invoice or delivery receipt) system.

* **Chalan.model.js (10:59 AM):** Defines a Mongoose schema for the Challan model.  It includes a pre-save hook to auto-generate unique challan numbers using a counter model.
* **chalan.routes.js (11:01 AM):** Sets up Express routes for creating, retrieving, and downloading challans.  All routes are protected by authentication middleware.
* **chalan.controller.js (11:06 AM):** Implements the controller logic for the challan routes, including creating, retrieving (by ID and order ID), and downloading challans as PDFs using `pdfkit`.  The controller includes error handling and populates related data (orders, customers, addresses).
* **index.js (11:08 AM):** The main backend file was updated to include the challan routes and to set up Socket.IO for real-time communication, using custom middleware for authentication (`socketAuthenticator`) and management (`socketManager`).

**M_Frontend (App.jsx):** The `App.jsx` file, updated at 11:17 AM, integrates the `Navbar` component and sets up routing for different application pages including a dashboard, order management, customer management, user management, financial pages, settings, and order types (graphics, cutout, accounts, and display).  It also manages the sidebar's state and uses a `SocketProvider` to provide socket context to its child components.  The routing uses `react-router-dom` and private routes (`PrivateRoute`) to control access to certain pages.

In summary, the commits represent a significant update to the application, adding a new challan management system to the backend and integrating real-time notification and sidebar functionality to the frontend.  The consistent use of timestamps indicates a focused development period.  The use of `axios` on the frontend and corresponding controller/route implementations on the backend suggests a well-structured API-driven architecture.


## 11:41:01 AM
The log shows multiple React component updates within a project, primarily focused on fetching and displaying tutor information and managing project files.  Several components utilize similar patterns for fetching data via `axiosInstance` and handling errors with `toast` notifications.  Authentication is handled consistently using `useAuth` and cookies.

**`BidTutorList.js` (5/13/2025, 11:09:37 AM):** This component fetches and displays a list of tutor bids for a given homework ID.  It includes client-side sorting functionality for bids based on relevance, date, rating, and price.  The component maps bid data to a `TutorCard` format, handling missing data gracefully.

**`InviteTutors.js` (5/13/2025, 11:10:03 AM):** This component allows users to search for and invite tutors to a project. It features a search bar and sorting options (similar to `BidTutorList.js`), fetching tutors by subject ID. A fallback to mock data is implemented for error handling during development.

**`UploadFiles.js` (5/13/2025, 11:11:04 AM):**  This component manages file uploads and downloads for a project. It allows filtering files by user ("Your Files," "Writer's File," "All") and provides options for deleting files. File uploads are handled using a FormData, and the component includes robust error handling.  The component also features separate filter modals and sorting options for desktop and mobile views.

**`InviteModal.js` (5/13/2025, 11:11:31 AM):** A simple modal component that prompts users to invite more tutors,  with a conditional render based on the `orderType`.

**`ExpertCard.js` (5/13/2025, 11:13:21 AM and 5/13/2025, 11:13:53 AM):** This component displays individual tutor cards, showing details like name, image, rating, and price.  There are two identical entries for this file suggesting a possible accidental duplicate commit, no changes were observed between the two commits.  The component includes modals for displaying payment information and tutor reviews.  Headline text is truncated for display purposes but can be expanded for full viewing.

**`CreateNewProject.js` (Multiple timestamps between 11:15:23 AM and 11:40:40 AM):**  This component is the most extensively modified throughout the log. It's a form for creating or editing projects, handling various project details, including title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type, word count, and file uploads.  Multiple updates within this component refine the file upload functionality, error handling, and data fetching for edit mode.  The component retrieves subject categories from local storage.  This component underwent several updates over a span of nearly 30 minutes, likely due to debugging or refactoring.

**`invite-expert\page.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 11:29:15 AM and 11:32:08 AM):** This page component renders the `InviteTutors` component and handles navigation parameters for subject, subject ID, and homework ID.  It includes conditional rendering for authenticated users.  Modifications seem minor to the structure and primarily added logging statements that seem unnecessary.


## 1:14:57 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `CreateNewProject.js` and `page.jsx`.  `CreateNewProject.js` underwent several revisions between 11:41 AM and 12:14 PM, primarily focusing on enhancements to project creation and editing functionalities.  These changes involved adding file upload capabilities, improving category and subject management, and refining error handling.  The file uses `axiosInstance` for API calls to handle project creation, updates, and fetching details, relying on JWT tokens for authentication.  The `handleSubmit` function includes logic for both creating new projects and updating existing ones.

The `page.jsx` file was modified between 11:43 AM and 12:14 PM.  Initial versions show attempts to retrieve parameters (`selectedsubjectName`, `projectsubject`) from the URL.  Later revisions simplify parameter retrieval and remove unnecessary `usePathname` hook and redundant useSearchParams calls, using only one `useSearchParams()` call. The file renders different navigation bars (`CommunityNavbar`, `LandingNavbar`, `MobileNavBar`) based on authentication status, and includes an `InviteTutors` component that receives project information from URL parameters.  The final version of `page.jsx` removes unused variables and streamlines the parameter retrieval process, suggesting a focus on cleaning up the code.  The changes in `page.jsx` are much less substantial compared to the extensive updates in `CreateNewProject.js`.


## 2:14:45 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CreateNewProject.js` and `InviteTutors.js` components.  The `CreateNewProject.js` file underwent significant changes between 1:15 PM and 1:54 PM on May 13, 2025.  Initially, the component contained a fully functional form for creating and editing new projects, including features for file uploads, category and subject selection, deadline setting, and order type selection.  The component uses several external libraries including `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/dates`, `lucide-react`, `sonner`, and `js-cookie` and makes API calls using `axiosInstance` to handle project creation and retrieval.  Between 1:29 PM and 1:54 PM, the entire content of `CreateNewProject.js` was commented out.  This suggests a potential temporary disabling or refactoring of the component.

`InviteTutors.js`, updated at 1:58 PM, appears to be a component for inviting tutors to a project.  It fetches tutor data based on subject ID and allows users to search and sort tutors based on various criteria (relevance, price, etc.). The component also utilizes `axiosInstance` for API calls and displays tutor information using a custom `TutorCard` component.  Unlike `CreateNewProject.js`, this component's code is fully functional and not commented out.  The `InviteTutors` component makes use of several mock images and utilizes `useAuth` and `Cookies` for authentication and authorization.  The consistent use of `axiosInstance`, `useAuth`, `Cookies`, and `toast` across both components highlights a common backend communication and user authentication strategy.


## 3:14:44 PM
The log shows updates to two files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project on May 13, 2025.

`InviteTutors.js` (2:20:35 PM): This file contains React code for a component that allows users to invite tutors to a project.  The component fetches tutor data based on subject ID using `axiosInstance` making API calls to `/tutor/search/by-subject` endpoint.  It includes search functionality, sorting options (by relevance, price, and date), and displays tutor information using a custom `TutorCard` component.  Error handling is implemented using `toast` notifications and fallback to mock data. The code extensively uses functional components and hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.  Data mapping from API response to the `TutorCard` format is also included.


`CreateNewProject.js` (2:27:27 PM and 2:34:25 PM): This file was updated twice in quick succession. It's a React component for creating or editing new projects.  It uses `axiosInstance` to interact with the backend (`/api/homework/${homeworkId}` for fetching details and `/api/files/upload/${userId}` for file uploads). The component manages project details (title, content, type, subject, deadline, etc.), file uploads (using FormData), and subject category selection.  It fetches subject categories from localStorage and handles edit mode by using the `useSearchParams` hook from `next/navigation` to retrieve the `edit` parameter.  The code demonstrates significant state management, including file upload status, edit mode, and category/subject selection.  There's no visible functional difference between the two updates at 2:27:27 PM and 2:34:25 PM; the code is identical in both entries.  The `typeOptions` constant reveals a comprehensive list of supported project types.


## 3:14:50 PM
The log shows development across frontend and backend components related to challan management.

**Backend (c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Backend):**

* **`chalan.controller.js` (5/13/2025, 2:59:18 PM & 5/13/2025, 3:07:55 PM):** This file underwent two updates.  The initial version contained functions for creating, retrieving (individual and by order ID), and downloading challans as PDFs.  The second update likely involved minor refactoring or bug fixes, as the core functionality remained the same.  The code uses `pdfkit` for PDF generation and includes company details hardcoded into the controller.

* **`challan.routes.js` (5/13/2025, 3:07:13 PM, 5/13/2025, 3:08:47 PM & 5/13/2025, 3:10:31 PM):** This file defines the API routes for challan management. The updates show a change in the authentication middleware import (`authMiddleware` to `{ auth }`), suggesting a potential refactoring of authentication handling. No significant change in functionality occurred between the last two updates.

* **`index.js` (5/13/2025, 3:11:36 PM):**  This file is the backend server entry point.  It sets up the server using Express, connects to a database (using `database.connectWithDb()`), configures middleware (including `cors`, `cookieParser`, and `express-fileupload`), and defines routes for various API endpoints, including the `/api/v1/challan` route for challan management.  The server also includes socket.io integration, using a custom `socketAuthenticator` middleware and `socketManager` for handling user connections and disconnections.  The `cors` configuration was updated to allow all origins, potentially for development purposes but should be tightened before production.


**Frontend (c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\M\M_Frontend):**

* **`Sidebar.jsx` (5/13/2025, 3:04:14 PM):** This component renders a sidebar navigation menu, dynamically adapting the menu items based on the user's role (`SuperAdmin`, `Admin`, `Graphics`, `Cutout`, `Accounts`, `Display`).  The menu uses `lucide-react` icons.

* **`App.jsx` (5/13/2025, 3:04:20 PM & 5/13/2025, 3:14:27 PM):** The React application's main component.  It sets up routing using `react-router-dom`, integrates `react-hot-toast` for notifications, and uses a custom `PrivateRoute` component for authentication.  The app includes components for login, signup, and various pages (Dashboard, Orders, Customers, etc.). It uses `SocketProvider` to wrap the application, showing that this is a key part of the application architecture. The second update added the `/challan` route, integrating the new challan management page.

* **`Challan.jsx` (5/13/2025, 3:05:01 PM):** This page displays a list of challans, allowing filtering by search term and status. It uses pagination and includes status badges with color-coding. It uses `react-toastify` for displaying notifications and the `useSocketEvents` custom hook for receiving real-time updates from the server.

* **`ChallanManager.jsx` (5/13/2025, 3:05:24 PM):** A component for managing challans related to a specific order. It opens a modal (`ChallanModal`) to allow users to create new challans or download existing ones.

* **`ChallanModal.jsx` (5/13/2025, 3:06:32 PM):** A modal component for creating or viewing existing challans. It allows users to input challan details (transporter information, material details, etc.) and includes validation and loading states.  It switches between "create" and "list" views based on the existence of existing challans.


The overall pattern shows a well-structured application with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.  The use of  `socket.io` indicates real-time updates are implemented, which is a significant architectural choice enabling real-time status updates.  The development process involved iterative updates across both the frontend and backend, focusing on the addition and refinement of the challan management feature.


## 5:14:48 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two React component files: `CreateNewProject.js` and `InviteTutors.js`.  The majority of changes are concentrated in `CreateNewProject.js`, suggesting more extensive development on this component.

`CreateNewProject.js` underwent numerous revisions between 4:16 PM and 5:12 PM.  These revisions primarily involve the addition and modification of state variables,  `useEffect` hooks for fetching project details and managing subject categories, and functions for file upload (`uploadFile`, `handleFileSelect`, `handleRemoveFile`, `handleAttachClick`), subject selection (`handleSubjectChange`), and word count management (`handleWordCountChange`).  The component fetches data using `axiosInstance` and utilizes  `useAuth` and `useRouter` hooks from Next.js. It handles form submission (`handleSubmit`) and displays error messages using `toast`. A significant portion of the code deals with handling edit mode (`isEditMode`), retrieving and populating the form with existing project data.  The extensive use of `useEffect` hooks suggests a complex data fetching and state management system.

`InviteTutors.js` shows two updates, both within a short timeframe around 4:23 PM and 4:25 PM.  The component focuses on fetching and displaying a list of tutors. The tutor data is fetched based on subject using `axiosInstance`, with a fallback to mock data (`mockTutors`).  The component includes search functionality (`handleSearch`) and sorting capabilities (`handleSortSelect`) for the tutor list, using several sorting criteria (most relevant, price, latest, etc.).  Similar to `CreateNewProject.js`, it utilizes `useAuth` for authentication and `toast` for error handling.  The `mapApiTutorToCardFormat` function transforms tutor data from the API response into a format suitable for the `TutorCard` component.  The changes between the two timestamps do not reflect substantial alterations in the logic or functionality.


## 6:14:45 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `Auction.js` component between 5:36 PM and 5:38 PM on May 13, 2025, focusing on improvements to content display and styling.  The initial version lacks content expansion functionality. Subsequent updates introduce a `contentRef` and related state variables (`isExpanded`, `isOverflowing`) to implement a "See more/See less" feature for truncating long project descriptions, limiting the content display to four lines initially, and then adding a button for expansion.  The button's styling is also refined in the final version (changing from `text-blue-500` to `text-[#640D51]`).  The `useEffect` hook is used consistently to fetch project details and tutor bids based on the `id`, `userId`, and `jwtToken`.  There's also a progress tracker component implemented.

A `CreateNewProject.js` file is also present in the log with a timestamp of 5:49:32 PM on May 13, 2025, containing commented-out code for a React component responsible for creating new projects.  This component handles form input, file uploads, category selection, subject selection, and submission.  The commented-out code suggests a rich feature set including a date/time picker, switch components, and error handling using `toast`.  The component fetches and manages subject categories and uses `axiosInstance` for API calls.  The code appears complete but is commented out, indicating it might be under development or temporarily disabled.

Finally, the `next.config.mjs` file was modified twice at 5:42:04 PM and 5:42:32 PM on May 13, 2025. The changes are insignificant and only involve the formatting of image domains.  No functional changes are observed.


## 7:14:45 PM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `CreateNewProject.js` and `InviteExpertCard.js`.

`CreateNewProject.js` underwent two updates on May 13th, 2025. Both updates consist of commented-out code, suggesting the functionality might be temporarily disabled or undergoing revision. The code represents a form for creating or editing a new project, featuring extensive state management for project details (title, content, type, subject, deadline, word count, etc.), file uploads using `axiosInstance`, and handling of subject categories fetched from localStorage.  The component uses several external libraries including `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/dates`, `lucide-react`, `sonner`, and `js-cookie`.  A significant portion of the code deals with fetching and displaying project details in edit mode, utilizing `useSearchParams` from `next/navigation` and making API calls via `axiosInstance` to retrieve data based on a `homeworkId`.

`InviteExpertCard.js` was updated once on May 13th, 2025, at 6:22:26 PM. This component renders a card displaying tutor information and allows users to invite tutors to a project (`homeworkId` is passed as a prop).  It uses `axiosInstance` to send an invitation request, handles loading states, and displays success or error messages using `sonner`.  The component is responsive, providing different layouts for desktop and mobile views.  The code includes detailed styling using Tailwind CSS classes, along with conditional rendering based on tutor attributes (online status, verification, badges, etc.) and interactive elements such as a modal explaining the invitation process.  The component manages state for modal visibility, invitation status, and utilizes `useAuth` and `js-cookie` for authentication.


## 10:09:43 PM
The `CreateNewProject.js` component, last updated on 5/13/2025 at 7:36:02 PM,  manages the creation and editing of project entries.  It uses a multitude of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) and external libraries (`axios`, `mantine`, `lucide-react`, `sonner`, `next/navigation`, `js-cookie`) for state management, API calls, UI elements, and routing.

The component handles form submission, file uploads (using FormData), and fetching/displaying project details in edit mode.  Significant logic involves fetching subject categories from localStorage and dynamically updating subject options based on selected category.  Error handling is included using `toast` notifications.

The code includes extensive state management for project details (title, content, type, subject, deadline, etc.), file uploads (selected file, file name, file response), and category selection (subject categories, selected category, subjects).  A notable feature is the support for different project types, represented by an `typeOptions` object. The component also handles fetching project details based on `homeworkId` received through URL parameters (`useSearchParams`).  File uploads are handled using an `axiosInstance` to POST to `/api/files/upload/{userId}?uploadType=PROJECT`.  The `jwtToken` and `userId` are retrieved from Cookies or the auth context.  Finally there is a word counter with a minimum word count of 100 words.
