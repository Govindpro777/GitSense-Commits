# Activity Summary for 5/23/2025

## 10:54:05 AM
The log shows development across both frontend and backend components of an LMS system, focusing on demo student registration and login functionality.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/DemoStudentRegistration.js:** This file underwent multiple revisions.  Initially (12:38:32 AM), it contained a fully functional React component for demo student registration.  The component features input validation for name, email, and mobile number, uses `axios` for API calls to `/v1/demo-students/register`, and provides visual feedback to the user via toast notifications and error messages.  Later (12:48:29 AM and 12:48:35 AM), the file was completely commented out, before being restored to a functional state in the final commit.

**LMS_backend/index.js:** This file, representing the backend server, was updated at 12:39:39 AM. The key change was a significant refactoring of route handling. Initially, many routes were directly defined using `app.use`. This was changed to use a `lazyLoadRoute` utility function, dynamically importing route modules, potentially improving load times and organization.  This impacted many API endpoints related to users, courses, teachers, and other LMS features.  The backend uses `express.js`, `cors`, `cookie-parser`, and `dotenv` for environment variable handling.  The server listens on port 5000.  A new `/api/v1/admission` route was added.

**LMS_backend/utils/uploadvideoToCloudinary.js:** This utility function (updated 12:39:52 AM) handles uploading video files to Cloudinary. It uses Cloudinary's `upload_stream` to handle large video files efficiently.  Configuration details are loaded from environment variables.

**LMS_backend/controller/demoStudentController.js:** Updated at 12:42:18 AM, this file contains the backend logic for demo student registration and login.  It uses the `User` model for database interactions.  The `registerForDemo` function validates input, checks for existing users, saves new users, and sends a welcome email.  The `demoLogin` function handles demo student login based on email or mobile number.  An older version of the code (commented out)  handled name splitting into `firstName` and `lastName` and used it in the email, while the final version just uses the name field as is.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/DemoLogin.js:** This component (created at 1:18:00 AM) handles demo student login, specifically designed for cases where an email already exists. It allows users to log in using an existing email address.  It leverages axios to post to `/v1/demo-students/login`.  The component incorporates input validation and provides user feedback using toast messages. The component handles pre-filling the email field if an email is passed in the `existingEmail` prop.

**LMS_frontend/src/app/book-demo/BookingDemo.js:** This file (updates at 10:11:53 AM and 10:12:12 AM) was entirely commented out in both commits. The commented-out code suggests a component for booking demo classes. The code seems to fetch course details, handle teacher selection, display available time slots, and allow users to book slots.  Significant logic is included for handling API calls to fetch course details and time slots, along with data manipulation and display.  The comments indicate that a new API response structure was incorporated which altered the way that slots were processed.


In summary, the changes reflect the development of a demo student registration and login system within a larger LMS application.  The backend was significantly reorganized to use lazy loading of routes. The frontend was updated to include a login form and there is some commented-out code that suggests a feature is under development.  The overall pattern demonstrates a well-structured approach to building a web application with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.


## 1:14:45 PM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\FAQHomework.js` underwent several revisions on May 23, 2025.

The initial versions (12:28:27 PM and 12:28:39 PM) contained placeholder FAQ data hardcoded within the component.  The code was primarily focused on rendering a list of FAQs using an Accordion component.  These early versions lacked dynamic data fetching.

A significant update occurred at 12:38:47 PM. This revision introduced:

* **Dynamic data fetching:** The component now fetches FAQ data from an API endpoint (`/api/faqs/homework`) using `axiosInstance.get`.  The API call includes parameters to limit the number of FAQs and control whether to show all FAQs.
* **Error handling:** The component now includes mechanisms to handle loading states (`isLoading`) and API errors (`error`), displaying appropriate messages to the user.
* **Link handling:**  A key change involves adding functionality to process and render links within the FAQ answers. The `processTextWithLinks` function finds specific text within the answers and converts them into clickable links using `<Link>` from `next/link`.  The logic sorts links by length to prevent issues with partial replacements.  The `renderTextWithLinks` helper function renders the processed text containing links as JSX.
* **Improved Loading and Error UI:** The loading and error states now have improved user interface elements, showing a spinner for loading and a clear error message with a retry button.  The overall layout and styling of these states are more polished.

In summary, the final version represents a substantial improvement over the initial versions by incorporating dynamic data fetching, robust error handling, and the ability to render links within the FAQ answers, enhancing the user experience and making the component more robust and data-driven. The changes demonstrate a shift from static content to a dynamic, API-driven approach.
