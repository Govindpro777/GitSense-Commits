# Activity Summary for 5/6/2025

## 12:45:10 AM
The log shows backend and frontend code changes across several controllers (`invoice`, `customer`, `cutout`, `graphics`, `order`, `user`, `lead`) and frontend components related to order management, customer management, and lead management.  The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development around May 5th and 6th, 2025.

**`invoice.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:54:53 PM):** This file handles invoice creation, retrieval, and PDF generation.  Significant changes involve the implementation of invoice creation based on paid orders, including calculation of subtotals, taxes, and total amounts.  The generation of PDF invoices is also included, utilizing the `pdfkit` library. The `COMPANY_DETAILS` constant is defined directly in the code which may need to be moved to env variables or database for better management.

**`customer.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:55:46 PM):** This controller manages customer creation, updates, and deletion.  It includes robust validation to prevent duplicate email and phone number entries.  Customer address is managed through a separate `Address` model.  The code also handles the case where a customer might not have an address associated.

**`cutout.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:56:02 PM):** This controller focuses on order assignment to cutout users, status updates, and CAD file retrieval.  It uses Socket.IO for real-time notifications, logging status changes to a `Log` model. The code includes functions to assign order to cutout user and to change status accordingly.  The controller also handles downloading individual or zipped CAD files.

**`graphics.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:57:53 PM):**  This controller manages order creation and assignment to graphics users. It includes logic for finding an available graphics user and managing order statuses.  It uses Socket.IO for notifications and has functions to calculate order priority and estimated completion time. The order creation functionality is heavily commented out, indicating potential work in progress or refactoring.

**`order.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:58:23 PM):** This controller handles various order operations, including order assignment, retrieval, updates, deletion, and approval.  It populates related models (customer, assignedTo, approvedBy, createdBy) when retrieving orders.  There's significant logic for handling status changes and logging those changes.

**`user.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:58:44 PM):**  This controller manages user signup and login. It uses bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for authentication. A significant portion involves setting up and sending welcome emails via Nodemailer, including the use of HTML templates and embedded images.

**`auth.js` (5/5/2025, 11:59:15 PM):** This middleware handles authentication and authorization, checking user roles (Admin, SuperAdmin, Accounts, Graphics, Cutout, Viewer) to restrict access to specific routes.  Multiple middleware functions are defined for different roles and combinations of roles.

**`FinancialTransaction.model.js` (5/6/2025, 12:00:13 AM):** This model defines the schema for financial transactions.  It includes pre-save hooks to automatically generate invoice numbers and set payment dates based on transaction status.

**`order.model.js` (5/6/2025, 12:00:40 AM):** This model defines the schema for orders. It includes a pre-save hook for auto-generating unique order IDs using a counter model.  The `status` field includes numerous statuses indicating the order's progress through different stages.

**Frontend Changes (5/6/2025):**  The frontend components and pages demonstrate a consistent UI design using Tailwind CSS.  These changes include:

*   **`CutoutOrderDetailsModal.jsx`**:  Displays order details for Cutout users, including file downloads and status updates.
*   **`FileUploadModal.jsx`**: A modal for uploading files for graphics orders.
*   **`UploadedFilesModal.jsx`**:  A modal to display uploaded files.
*   **`Sidebar.jsx`**: A sidebar navigation component.
*   **`Navbar.jsx`**: A navbar component that contains notifications and other functionalities.
*   **`AccountsOrder.jsx`**: Displays and manages accounts orders.
*   **`InvoiceModal.jsx`**:  A modal for managing invoices (commented out, possibly under development).
*   **`Lead.controller.js`**: Lead management functionality is implemented in this controller and includes changes and additions between timestamps 12:07:42 AM and 12:15:26 AM.
*   **`Leads.jsx`**: A page for managing leads, with features for adding, editing, converting to customers, and deleting leads. The component has gone through several revisions (as seen from multiple timestamps) to improve the functionality and the UI.


In summary, the codebase underwent significant updates related to order and lead management, including robust error handling, authentication, authorization, and real-time updates using Socket.IO. The frontend updates primarily focus on enhancing user experience and interaction with the backend API.  There is evidence of ongoing development and potential refactoring as seen in commented-out code sections and multiple versions of certain files.


## 10:54:45 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `ProjectDetails.js` and `Auction.js`.  `ProjectDetails.js` underwent several minor revisions between 10:09:54 AM and 10:44:43 AM on May 6, 2025, with no substantial changes to its core functionality. The changes appear to be primarily focused on styling and possibly minor bug fixes, as the code remains largely the same across all revisions.


`Auction.js` shows more significant changes between 10:12:47 AM and 10:42:15 AM on May 6, 2025.  The most notable updates include:

* **10:15:18 AM:** Addition of `Cookies` import statement, suggesting the implementation of cookie-based authentication.  The `fetchProjectDetails` function now correctly uses the `id` prop to fetch project details.

* **10:40:10 AM & 10:40:54 AM:** Introduction of `isLoading` and `projectData` state variables for managing the loading state during API calls, along with improvements to error handling within `fetchProjectDetails`.  The use of `homeworkId` is replaced with `id`, and unnecessary file-handling logic is removed from `fetchProjectDetails`.

* **10:42:01 AM & 10:42:15 AM:** Minor refinements in the `handleSortSelect` function (removal of unnecessary console.log), and further simplification and refactoring of the code structure. The `projectTitle` is now correctly rendered within backticks in the Annotated Bibliography section.


The `Auction.js` file uses `axiosInstance` for API calls to `/api/homework/{id}` to fetch project details, utilizing `jwtToken` and `userId` for authentication and authorization.  The UI includes a progress tracker, sections for project details, a promotion banner, and an invite-a-friend section.  The recurring use of inline styles and Tailwind CSS classes is consistent throughout both files.  There's a pattern of using `Image` components from `next/image` for various icons and illustrations.


## 2:57:31 PM
The log shows several modifications across three React component files (`ExpertCard.js`, `BidTutorList.js`, and `Auction.js`) within a React frontend application, all occurring on May 6, 2025.

`ExpertCard.js` (2:23:41 PM): This component underwent significant changes to improve its responsiveness.  The code now includes distinct `DesktopView` and `MobileView` functions to handle different screen sizes, adapting the layout and image dimensions accordingly.  A modal for payment information was added, triggered by a "?" button. The modal uses a click-outside-to-close mechanism using `useEffect` and `useRef`.  The component also incorporates various styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS classes to manage responsiveness and visual elements (images, icons, text).

`BidTutorList.js` (2:32:25 PM, 2:33:31 PM, 2:34:06 PM): This component retrieves and displays a list of tutor bids for a given `homeworkId`.  It fetches data using `axiosInstance` and handles loading states (`isLoading`).  A sorting functionality was added, allowing users to sort bids by relevance, price, and date. The sorting functionality is implemented using a `switch` statement and  updates the UI accordingly.  The component also includes error handling using `toast.error` and gracefully handles the case where there are no bids. Three consecutive commits show minor changes, particularly in the `paymentInfo` calculation within `mapBidToTutorData`. The initial commit calculated it as 30% of the `bid.amount`, the subsequent commits changed this to `Math.round(bid.amount * 0.3)` and then back to the initial calculation, suggesting some experimentation with rounding.


`Auction.js` (2:32:44 PM, 2:45:04 PM, 2:45:38 PM, 2:48:30 PM): This component initially was commented out completely showing a fully commented out version, then progressively became functional.  It displays details of an auction (`id` passed as prop).  The component fetches project details using `axiosInstance` and displays progress using a step-based progress tracker.  Initially, it contained a commented-out section that replicated elements found in `BidTutorList`, such as sorting functionality and tutor display using `TutorCard`.  Subsequent commits integrated the `BidTutorList` component to improve organization and removed redundant sorting logic,  and finally removed the direct rendering of `TutorCard` components in favor of using the `BidTutorList` component.  This component also uses `useAuth` and `Cookies` to manage authentication, similar to `BidTutorList`.


## 3:57:26 PM
The log shows a single code update to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\models\customer.model.js` at 3:56:57 PM on May 6, 2025.  This update defines a Mongoose schema for a `Customer` model.  The schema includes fields for firstName, lastName, phoneNo, email, gstNo, panNo, password, createdBy, and references to Address and Order models via ObjectIds.  A pre-save hook is implemented to automatically generate the `name` field by concatenating firstName and lastName.  The code uses Mongoose for database interaction.


## 3:57:29 PM
The log shows several code changes across three files on May 6th, 2025.

`ExpertCard.js` was updated twice within a minute (3:02:58 PM and 3:03:16 PM).  These changes primarily involved refinements to the responsive design of the `TutorCard` component, adjusting the layout and sizes of elements (images, text) for different screen sizes (xs, sm, md, lg, xl).  No functional changes were made; only styling and responsiveness adjustments were implemented.  The second commit seems to have only adjusted the button text conditionally based on whether a price is set or not.


`page.jsx`  underwent two minor modifications  between 3:26:40 PM and 3:27:01 PM. The changes focused on how the `id` parameter is accessed and used within the component. Initially `const { id } = params;` was used, but this was subsequently changed to  `const { id } = use(params);` . This suggests a possible shift in how the routing or parameter handling is done, but without more context, the precise reason is unclear.

`BidTutorList.js` was modified three times between 3:28:31 PM and 3:29:45 PM.  These changes center around a component that displays a list of tutor bids, fetching data via an API call (`/api/bids/order/${homeworkId}`). The component includes sorting functionality (Most Relevant, Least Relevant, Latest, Price: Lowest first, Price: Highest first).  The significant updates are in the `mapBidToTutorData` function, where initially `priceValue` was 0, and later changed to  `bid.amount`. Also the `isOnline` property in the tutor data was toggled between true and false.  These are minor changes, likely bug fixes or minor data adjustments in how bid information is displayed.


## 4:57:32 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `customer.controller.js` file between 3:59:13 PM and 4:01:05 PM on May 6, 2025, primarily focusing on adding `gstNo` and `panNo` fields to the customer model and updating the `updateCustomer` function to handle these new fields.  The changes ensure that these fields are updated only if they are provided in the request body.  There is no change to the logic for creating customers.

The `Customers.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 4:03:47 PM and 4:25:10 PM on May 6, 2025.  These changes involved enhancing the customer data display by adding GST and PAN information to the table and including these fields in the search functionality.  Additionally, the edit modal was updated to include the new GST and PAN number fields.  A significant change at 4:09:41 PM added a "Documents" column to display GST and PAN details more clearly.  The final revision at 4:25:10 PM maintains these additions without further modification.

The `invoice.controller.js` file shows the development of an invoice generation system between 4:36:46 PM and 4:51:57 PM on May 6, 2025. The initial commit was commented out, suggesting it was a placeholder or an earlier iteration. Subsequent commits added functionality to create, retrieve, and download invoices as PDFs.  The PDF generation includes company and customer details along with invoice items, and the customer's GST and PAN numbers are incorporated into the invoice's customer address section. The `generateInvoicePDF` function is a substantial part of this controller and lays out the structure of the PDF invoice.  The code repeatedly uses `.populate()` for database queries, suggesting a relationship-driven database schema.  There's a consistent use of try-catch blocks for error handling in all functions.


## 5:57:33 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Auction.js`, a React component likely part of a larger project bidding system.  The main focus of the changes revolves around fetching and displaying project and bid data.

The earliest revisions (5/6/2025, 5:36:50 PM - 5:37:48 PM) show initial development of the component.  The component fetches project details using `axiosInstance.get('/api/homework/${id}')`, requiring a `jwtToken` and `userId`.  It renders a progress tracker, project title and content, and includes components for auction details (`TheAuction`), an invite-and-earn program (`InviteAndEarn`), and project details (`ProjectDetails`).  There's also commented-out code related to sorting options for tutors, suggesting this feature was initially planned but later removed or deferred. A visually appealing UI is implemented using tailwind CSS.

A significant change occurs around 5/6/2025, 5:38:50 PM.  A new `useEffect` hook and the `fetchTutorBids` function are added. This function uses `axiosInstance.get('/api/bids/order/${homeworkId}')` to retrieve tutor bids.  The `homeworkId` variable is used inconsistently, initially seemingly aliased to `id`, but later correctly corrected to `id`. This indicates the component now retrieves both project and bid data.  The `sortOptions` and related functionality are fully commented out in this revision.


The final revisions (5/6/2025, 5:45:25 PM - 5:50:07 PM) refine the `fetchTutorBids` function, consistently using `id` instead of `homeworkId`.  Additionally, conditional rendering is added; `TheAuction` and `InviteAndEarn` components are only rendered if `tutorBids.length === 0`. This suggests a change in the UI flow depending on whether bids exist.  The commented-out code for sorting tutors persists, implying that feature remains out of scope, at least for this version.

In summary, the code evolved from a basic project display to a component dynamically showing project details and tutor bids, with a conditional UI based on bid presence. The removal of tutor sorting and the focus on fetching bid data were key developments throughout the revision process.  The final version uses the `id` consistently for fetching data.
