# Activity Summary for 5/6/2025

## 12:45:10 AM
The log shows backend and frontend code changes across several controllers (`invoice`, `customer`, `cutout`, `graphics`, `order`, `user`, `lead`) and frontend components related to order management, customer management, and lead management.  The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development around May 5th and 6th, 2025.

**`invoice.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:54:53 PM):** This file handles invoice creation, retrieval, and PDF generation.  Significant changes involve the implementation of invoice creation based on paid orders, including calculation of subtotals, taxes, and total amounts.  The generation of PDF invoices is also included, utilizing the `pdfkit` library. The `COMPANY_DETAILS` constant is defined directly in the code which may need to be moved to env variables or database for better management.

**`customer.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:55:46 PM):** This controller manages customer creation, updates, and deletion.  It includes robust validation to prevent duplicate email and phone number entries.  Customer address is managed through a separate `Address` model.  The code also handles the case where a customer might not have an address associated.

**`cutout.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:56:02 PM):** This controller focuses on order assignment to cutout users, status updates, and CAD file retrieval.  It uses Socket.IO for real-time notifications, logging status changes to a `Log` model. The code includes functions to assign order to cutout user and to change status accordingly.  The controller also handles downloading individual or zipped CAD files.

**`graphics.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:57:53 PM):**  This controller manages order creation and assignment to graphics users. It includes logic for finding an available graphics user and managing order statuses.  It uses Socket.IO for notifications and has functions to calculate order priority and estimated completion time. The order creation functionality is heavily commented out, indicating potential work in progress or refactoring.

**`order.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:58:23 PM):** This controller handles various order operations, including order assignment, retrieval, updates, deletion, and approval.  It populates related models (customer, assignedTo, approvedBy, createdBy) when retrieving orders.  There's significant logic for handling status changes and logging those changes.

**`user.controller.js` (5/5/2025, 11:58:44 PM):**  This controller manages user signup and login. It uses bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for authentication. A significant portion involves setting up and sending welcome emails via Nodemailer, including the use of HTML templates and embedded images.

**`auth.js` (5/5/2025, 11:59:15 PM):** This middleware handles authentication and authorization, checking user roles (Admin, SuperAdmin, Accounts, Graphics, Cutout, Viewer) to restrict access to specific routes.  Multiple middleware functions are defined for different roles and combinations of roles.

**`FinancialTransaction.model.js` (5/6/2025, 12:00:13 AM):** This model defines the schema for financial transactions.  It includes pre-save hooks to automatically generate invoice numbers and set payment dates based on transaction status.

**`order.model.js` (5/6/2025, 12:00:40 AM):** This model defines the schema for orders. It includes a pre-save hook for auto-generating unique order IDs using a counter model.  The `status` field includes numerous statuses indicating the order's progress through different stages.

**Frontend Changes (5/6/2025):**  The frontend components and pages demonstrate a consistent UI design using Tailwind CSS.  These changes include:

*   **`CutoutOrderDetailsModal.jsx`**:  Displays order details for Cutout users, including file downloads and status updates.
*   **`FileUploadModal.jsx`**: A modal for uploading files for graphics orders.
*   **`UploadedFilesModal.jsx`**:  A modal to display uploaded files.
*   **`Sidebar.jsx`**: A sidebar navigation component.
*   **`Navbar.jsx`**: A navbar component that contains notifications and other functionalities.
*   **`AccountsOrder.jsx`**: Displays and manages accounts orders.
*   **`InvoiceModal.jsx`**:  A modal for managing invoices (commented out, possibly under development).
*   **`Lead.controller.js`**: Lead management functionality is implemented in this controller and includes changes and additions between timestamps 12:07:42 AM and 12:15:26 AM.
*   **`Leads.jsx`**: A page for managing leads, with features for adding, editing, converting to customers, and deleting leads. The component has gone through several revisions (as seen from multiple timestamps) to improve the functionality and the UI.


In summary, the codebase underwent significant updates related to order and lead management, including robust error handling, authentication, authorization, and real-time updates using Socket.IO. The frontend updates primarily focus on enhancing user experience and interaction with the backend API.  There is evidence of ongoing development and potential refactoring as seen in commented-out code sections and multiple versions of certain files.


## 10:54:45 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `ProjectDetails.js` and `Auction.js`.  `ProjectDetails.js` underwent several minor revisions between 10:09:54 AM and 10:44:43 AM on May 6, 2025, with no substantial changes to its core functionality. The changes appear to be primarily focused on styling and possibly minor bug fixes, as the code remains largely the same across all revisions.


`Auction.js` shows more significant changes between 10:12:47 AM and 10:42:15 AM on May 6, 2025.  The most notable updates include:

* **10:15:18 AM:** Addition of `Cookies` import statement, suggesting the implementation of cookie-based authentication.  The `fetchProjectDetails` function now correctly uses the `id` prop to fetch project details.

* **10:40:10 AM & 10:40:54 AM:** Introduction of `isLoading` and `projectData` state variables for managing the loading state during API calls, along with improvements to error handling within `fetchProjectDetails`.  The use of `homeworkId` is replaced with `id`, and unnecessary file-handling logic is removed from `fetchProjectDetails`.

* **10:42:01 AM & 10:42:15 AM:** Minor refinements in the `handleSortSelect` function (removal of unnecessary console.log), and further simplification and refactoring of the code structure. The `projectTitle` is now correctly rendered within backticks in the Annotated Bibliography section.


The `Auction.js` file uses `axiosInstance` for API calls to `/api/homework/{id}` to fetch project details, utilizing `jwtToken` and `userId` for authentication and authorization.  The UI includes a progress tracker, sections for project details, a promotion banner, and an invite-a-friend section.  The recurring use of inline styles and Tailwind CSS classes is consistent throughout both files.  There's a pattern of using `Image` components from `next/image` for various icons and illustrations.
