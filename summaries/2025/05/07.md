# Activity Summary for 5/7/2025

## 2:07:27 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `RequestCorrection.js` between 1:56 PM and 2:07 PM on May 7, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, a modal for requesting corrections, remains consistent throughout.  The primary changes involve adding and modifying the UI, specifically the styling and layout of the modal.

Initially, the component was a simple modal with a text area for correction details, a file upload, and "Send" and "Cancel" buttons.  Around 1:56 PM, three additional popups (`RefundPendingPopup`, `OrderNotPaidPopup`, `OpinionCountsPopup`) were integrated. These popups are displayed conditionally based on whether the user clicks "Cancel," "Send," or "Review" respectively. A `handleFinalClose` function was added to perform cleanup after these nested popups close.

Subsequent changes between 1:57 PM and 2:07 PM focused on refining the UI.  These edits primarily involved adjusting CSS class names to control the width (`2xs:w-[...]`, `md:w-full`) of the text area for better responsiveness across different screen sizes.  There were also minor tweaks to padding (`p-2`, `p-4`) and button sizing (`2xs:px-4 2xs:py-2 md:px-6 md:py-2`) for improved visual appeal and consistency. The addition of `overflow-y-auto` to the main `div` suggests improvements to handle content overflow within the modal.  The text size of the action buttons was also modified for improved readability at different screen sizes (`2xs:text-[12px] xs:text-[14px] md:text-[16px]`).  These modifications suggest iterative design improvements based on testing and feedback.


## 3:07:25 PM
The log shows multiple edits to two React component files: `RequestCorrection.js` and `RefundRequestForm.js`.

`RequestCorrection.js` underwent significant changes between 2:09:09 PM and 2:10:48 PM.  Initially, it was a modal for requesting corrections, featuring a text area, file upload functionality, and "Cancel" and "Send" buttons.  The major update involved the addition of three new pop-up components (`RefundPendingPopup`, `OrderNotPaidPopup`, `OpinionCountsPopup`) displayed based on user interactions with the "Cancel" and "Send" buttons.  The "Send" button now triggers the `OrderNotPaidPopup`, and a new "Review" button triggers `OpinionCountsPopup`. Clicking "Cancel" opens the `RefundPendingPopup`.  A `handleFinalClose` function was added to perform cleanup after closing any of these nested popups. Minor styling adjustments, particularly for button sizes and image sizes across different screen sizes,  were also made within this period.

`RefundRequestForm.js` was modified between 2:15:15 PM and 2:18:08 PM. These edits primarily focused on minor styling adjustments and responsiveness using Tailwind CSS classes.  The changes involved altering text sizes (`2xs`, `xs`, `md`, `lg` classes) for headings and paragraphs to improve visual consistency across different screen sizes. The vertical timeline's styling also experienced some minor tweaks concerning its vertical position.  The most notable change was the reduction in size of the numbered steps within the form.

In summary, the code updates demonstrate a shift in functionality for `RequestCorrection.js` towards a more complex interaction flow with nested popups, while the updates to `RefundRequestForm.js` were primarily cosmetic, enhancing responsiveness and UI consistency.  The frequent updates to `RefundRequestForm.js` suggest iterative refinements to the component's layout and styling.


## 4:07:22 PM
The log shows two revisions of `InviteAndEarn.js`, a React component,  within a minute of each other on May 7, 2025.  Both revisions contain almost identical code, rendering an "Invite and Earn" section with desktop and mobile views. The core functionality and styling remain consistent. The only difference appears to be in the mobile view's heading and supporting text, which is slightly changed to present a different offer and target.  The first revision advertises earning "$25.00" while the second revision changed the offer to "$20 Off".  The referenced images (`/landing-page/project/*.svg`) are also consistent across both revisions.  No significant structural changes or additions/deletions were made to the code.


## 5:07:28 PM
The code changes primarily involve developing features related to inviting tutors for projects.  Significant modifications occurred between 4:43 PM and 5:06 PM on May 7th, 2025.

`CreateNewProject.js` (4:14:35 PM): This component was extensively updated to allow users to create new projects.  Key additions include file upload functionality using `axiosInstance` for API interaction, along with category and subject management based on data fetched from `localStorage` and handled via `useEffect` hooks.  Error handling using `toast` notifications is also implemented.  The component uses Material UI for styling and Lucide React for icons.

`InviteTutors.js` (4:37:41 PM, 4:58:43 PM, 5:00:07 PM, 5:00:49 PM, 5:03:17 PM):  This component displays a list of tutors, allowing users to search for experts.  The component is styled using Tailwind CSS and includes a search bar, tutor cards (`TutorCard` component), and a sidebar (`InviteExpertSideDetails` component).  Later updates added props `subject` and `subjectId` to the component, reflecting a change in how data is passed to it.  A crucial update around 5:03 PM resulted in a rename of the component to `inviteExpert`, changing its export name.

`InviteModal.js` (4:43:05 PM, 4:46:02 PM, 4:46:42 PM, 4:51:17 PM, 4:53:25 PM, 4:53:41 PM, 5:01:26 PM): This component, a modal, prompts users to invite more tutors if needed.  It's a simple component showing an invitation button that links to the `/homework/invite-expert` page.  The most significant changes involved adding `subject` and `subjectId` props, initially only logging them, and then finally using them to dynamically generate the href for the link to pass these variables as query parameters.  The addition of `"use client"` directive is observed in the last update.

`invite-expert/page.jsx` (4:54:04 PM, 4:54:13 PM, 4:54:27 PM, 4:54:35 PM, 5:04:09 PM, 5:05:04 PM, 5:05:22 PM, 5:06:04 PM): This page renders the `InviteTutors` component.  Initially, it conditionally rendered different navigation bars based on authentication status. There were several iterations to correctly fetch `subject` and `subjectId` from the router's query parameters and pass them down to `InviteTutors` as props.  The component name changed from `inviteExpert` to `InviteExpertPage` in one update around 5:04 PM. A change to `next/navigation` is present in one of the commits.  The debugging `console.log` statements were added and then removed in later updates.

Recurring elements include the use of `Image` from `next/image`, consistent styling with Tailwind CSS, and the use of custom components (`TutorCard`, `InviteExpertSideDetails`). The integration of routing (`useRouter` from `next/router` changed to `next/navigation`) and authentication (`useAuth`) are common themes throughout these files. The updates show a clear progression towards passing subject-related data between components.  The addition of `"use client"` directive is also a recurring change.


## 6:07:26 PM
The log shows development on a React frontend application, specifically focusing on components related to inviting tutors and creating new projects.

`InviteModal.js` underwent several revisions between 5:07 PM and 5:33 PM.  Initially, it was a simple modal with a button linking to `/homework/invite-expert`.  Subsequent changes added `subject` and `subjectId` props, initially with flawed prop destructuring and console logging statements that persisted through revisions. The most significant change involved modifying the `Link` component to pass `subject` and `subjectId` as query parameters to `/homework/invite-expert`, improving functionality by ensuring that context is passed between pages. This was done in multiple attempts, initially using `encodeURIComponent` and subsequently changing to using the `query` prop of the Link component. Finally, the Link component was changed back to a simple button.

`invite-expert\page.jsx` shows a page component for inviting experts.  It uses Redux's `useSelector` to access user data and the custom hook `useAuth` for authentication status. It conditionally renders a different navigation bar depending on whether the user is authenticated. It also renders the `InviteTutors` component. This component was created at 5:08 PM.

`CreateNewProject.js` (created at 5:14 PM) is a significantly larger component for creating new projects. It handles form submission, file uploads using `axiosInstance`, manages project details (title, content, type, subject, deadline, etc.), and integrates with a backend API (`/api/homework/create`) and redirects to an auction page after submission. The component fetches and manages subject categories from localStorage.  Error handling is implemented using `toast` notifications. The component also includes extensive form validation, uses Mantine UI components and Lucide React icons.

Overall, the changes demonstrate iterative development focusing on improving the user experience and functionality of the tutor invitation and project creation features. The repeated edits to `InviteModal.js` highlight the debugging process involved in passing data between pages and the process of iterating on the UI.


## 7:07:24 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `invite-expert` feature within a React application.  The updates span several files between 6:45 PM and 7:05 PM on May 7, 2025.

The `page.jsx` file in the `invite-expert` directory underwent multiple revisions.  Initially, it displayed different navigation bars based on authentication status.  Subsequent changes added the functionality to retrieve `subject` and `subjectId` parameters from the URL using `useSearchParams`. This suggests an integration with a subject selection mechanism elsewhere in the app.  The console logs added to `page.jsx` indicate debugging efforts related to retrieving subject information. There are small variations in the console log messages across different commits.


The `InviteModal.js` component was updated to include the `subject` and `subjectId` props within the link to `/homework/invite-expert`, passing these parameters as query parameters. This directly connects the modal to the `/homework/invite-expert` page, allowing for context to be passed.

The `InviteTutors.js` component saw the most significant changes.  Early revisions focused on layout and styling using Tailwind CSS.  The final revision (7:05:30 PM) is a complete overhaul. The commented-out code suggests a previous version that displayed static tutor data.  The final version replaces this with functionality to fetch tutor data using `axiosInstance` based on `subjectId` and `userId`.  The component now includes a search bar, sorting functionality (by relevance, price, and date), and uses a function `mapApiTutorToCardFormat` to transform fetched data into a format suitable for the `TutorCard` component.  Error handling and the use of mock data in case of API failures are also included.  The integration of cookies and authentication context (`useAuth`) suggests this data is only fetched if the user is authenticated.  A modal for sorting tutors is also implemented.

In summary, the code changes reflect the development of a tutor invitation feature.  The updates focused on routing, data fetching, and improved UI elements to provide a more interactive experience. The final version of `InviteTutors.js` shows a move towards a more robust and dynamic system that fetches tutor data based on context.


## 11:20:15 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the backend controllers (`accounts.controller.js` and `invoice.controller.js`) and a service file (`websocketStatus.js`) between 10:37 PM and 11:15 PM on May 7, 2025.

`accounts.controller.js`: This file manages account-related operations.  Significant changes include adding and refining functions for assigning orders to accounts (`assignOrderToAccount`), fetching assigned orders (`getAssignedOrders`), creating bills (`createBill`), updating bills (`updateBill`), fetching all bills (`getAllBill`), a basic account controller route (`accountController`), and updating account status (`updateAccountStatus`).  These functions extensively use Mongoose models (`Order`, `User`, `FinancialTransaction`, `Log`) for database interactions.  Error handling and status codes are consistently implemented.  A `sendAssignmentNotification` function manages real-time notifications via sockets.

`invoice.controller.js`: This file handles invoice creation and management.  The most significant changes involve the `createInvoice` function, which was revised multiple times.  Initial versions lacked logging of invoice creation; subsequent versions added logging using the `Log` model, first logging the user id, later improving it to include user name and role. The function creates invoices based on order details and items, calculating subtotals, taxes, and totals. It populates the invoice with company and customer addresses and generates an invoice number. The file also includes functions for retrieving invoices (`getAllInvoices`, `getInvoiceById`, `getInvoicesByOrderId`) and downloading invoices as PDFs (`downloadInvoice`). The generation of the PDF invoice utilizes the `pdfkit` library.  Company details are hardcoded, suggesting a future improvement to pull this data dynamically.

`websocketStatus.js`: This service manages real-time status updates using socket.io. The key functions are `changeStatus`, `changeStatusByCutout`, and `notifyOrderUpdated`.  These functions send notifications to admins and assigned users about order status changes and updates.  These functions use `socketManager` to get socket IDs and `notification` model to log the notification in the DB.  The updates focused on adding user name to notification messages for clarity and improved logging.  The `getAllAdmin` function is used to retrieve all admin users for notification purposes.


A recurring pattern is the consistent use of error handling within `try...catch` blocks and the use of appropriate HTTP status codes in the response objects.  The use of the `Log` model for auditing changes across both controllers is also notable.  The evolution of the invoice creation logging, specifically adding user name and role, highlights iterative improvement in functionality and logging.
