# Activity Summary for 5/7/2025

## 2:07:27 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `RequestCorrection.js` between 1:56 PM and 2:07 PM on May 7, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, a modal for requesting corrections, remains consistent throughout.  The primary changes involve adding and modifying the UI, specifically the styling and layout of the modal.

Initially, the component was a simple modal with a text area for correction details, a file upload, and "Send" and "Cancel" buttons.  Around 1:56 PM, three additional popups (`RefundPendingPopup`, `OrderNotPaidPopup`, `OpinionCountsPopup`) were integrated. These popups are displayed conditionally based on whether the user clicks "Cancel," "Send," or "Review" respectively. A `handleFinalClose` function was added to perform cleanup after these nested popups close.

Subsequent changes between 1:57 PM and 2:07 PM focused on refining the UI.  These edits primarily involved adjusting CSS class names to control the width (`2xs:w-[...]`, `md:w-full`) of the text area for better responsiveness across different screen sizes.  There were also minor tweaks to padding (`p-2`, `p-4`) and button sizing (`2xs:px-4 2xs:py-2 md:px-6 md:py-2`) for improved visual appeal and consistency. The addition of `overflow-y-auto` to the main `div` suggests improvements to handle content overflow within the modal.  The text size of the action buttons was also modified for improved readability at different screen sizes (`2xs:text-[12px] xs:text-[14px] md:text-[16px]`).  These modifications suggest iterative design improvements based on testing and feedback.


## 3:07:25 PM
The log shows multiple edits to two React component files: `RequestCorrection.js` and `RefundRequestForm.js`.

`RequestCorrection.js` underwent significant changes between 2:09:09 PM and 2:10:48 PM.  Initially, it was a modal for requesting corrections, featuring a text area, file upload functionality, and "Cancel" and "Send" buttons.  The major update involved the addition of three new pop-up components (`RefundPendingPopup`, `OrderNotPaidPopup`, `OpinionCountsPopup`) displayed based on user interactions with the "Cancel" and "Send" buttons.  The "Send" button now triggers the `OrderNotPaidPopup`, and a new "Review" button triggers `OpinionCountsPopup`. Clicking "Cancel" opens the `RefundPendingPopup`.  A `handleFinalClose` function was added to perform cleanup after closing any of these nested popups. Minor styling adjustments, particularly for button sizes and image sizes across different screen sizes,  were also made within this period.

`RefundRequestForm.js` was modified between 2:15:15 PM and 2:18:08 PM. These edits primarily focused on minor styling adjustments and responsiveness using Tailwind CSS classes.  The changes involved altering text sizes (`2xs`, `xs`, `md`, `lg` classes) for headings and paragraphs to improve visual consistency across different screen sizes. The vertical timeline's styling also experienced some minor tweaks concerning its vertical position.  The most notable change was the reduction in size of the numbered steps within the form.

In summary, the code updates demonstrate a shift in functionality for `RequestCorrection.js` towards a more complex interaction flow with nested popups, while the updates to `RefundRequestForm.js` were primarily cosmetic, enhancing responsiveness and UI consistency.  The frequent updates to `RefundRequestForm.js` suggest iterative refinements to the component's layout and styling.


## 4:07:22 PM
The log shows two revisions of `InviteAndEarn.js`, a React component,  within a minute of each other on May 7, 2025.  Both revisions contain almost identical code, rendering an "Invite and Earn" section with desktop and mobile views. The core functionality and styling remain consistent. The only difference appears to be in the mobile view's heading and supporting text, which is slightly changed to present a different offer and target.  The first revision advertises earning "$25.00" while the second revision changed the offer to "$20 Off".  The referenced images (`/landing-page/project/*.svg`) are also consistent across both revisions.  No significant structural changes or additions/deletions were made to the code.


## 5:07:28 PM
The code changes primarily involve developing features related to inviting tutors for projects.  Significant modifications occurred between 4:43 PM and 5:06 PM on May 7th, 2025.

`CreateNewProject.js` (4:14:35 PM): This component was extensively updated to allow users to create new projects.  Key additions include file upload functionality using `axiosInstance` for API interaction, along with category and subject management based on data fetched from `localStorage` and handled via `useEffect` hooks.  Error handling using `toast` notifications is also implemented.  The component uses Material UI for styling and Lucide React for icons.

`InviteTutors.js` (4:37:41 PM, 4:58:43 PM, 5:00:07 PM, 5:00:49 PM, 5:03:17 PM):  This component displays a list of tutors, allowing users to search for experts.  The component is styled using Tailwind CSS and includes a search bar, tutor cards (`TutorCard` component), and a sidebar (`InviteExpertSideDetails` component).  Later updates added props `subject` and `subjectId` to the component, reflecting a change in how data is passed to it.  A crucial update around 5:03 PM resulted in a rename of the component to `inviteExpert`, changing its export name.

`InviteModal.js` (4:43:05 PM, 4:46:02 PM, 4:46:42 PM, 4:51:17 PM, 4:53:25 PM, 4:53:41 PM, 5:01:26 PM): This component, a modal, prompts users to invite more tutors if needed.  It's a simple component showing an invitation button that links to the `/homework/invite-expert` page.  The most significant changes involved adding `subject` and `subjectId` props, initially only logging them, and then finally using them to dynamically generate the href for the link to pass these variables as query parameters.  The addition of `"use client"` directive is observed in the last update.

`invite-expert/page.jsx` (4:54:04 PM, 4:54:13 PM, 4:54:27 PM, 4:54:35 PM, 5:04:09 PM, 5:05:04 PM, 5:05:22 PM, 5:06:04 PM): This page renders the `InviteTutors` component.  Initially, it conditionally rendered different navigation bars based on authentication status. There were several iterations to correctly fetch `subject` and `subjectId` from the router's query parameters and pass them down to `InviteTutors` as props.  The component name changed from `inviteExpert` to `InviteExpertPage` in one update around 5:04 PM. A change to `next/navigation` is present in one of the commits.  The debugging `console.log` statements were added and then removed in later updates.

Recurring elements include the use of `Image` from `next/image`, consistent styling with Tailwind CSS, and the use of custom components (`TutorCard`, `InviteExpertSideDetails`). The integration of routing (`useRouter` from `next/router` changed to `next/navigation`) and authentication (`useAuth`) are common themes throughout these files. The updates show a clear progression towards passing subject-related data between components.  The addition of `"use client"` directive is also a recurring change.


## 6:07:26 PM
The log shows development on a React frontend application, specifically focusing on components related to inviting tutors and creating new projects.

`InviteModal.js` underwent several revisions between 5:07 PM and 5:33 PM.  Initially, it was a simple modal with a button linking to `/homework/invite-expert`.  Subsequent changes added `subject` and `subjectId` props, initially with flawed prop destructuring and console logging statements that persisted through revisions. The most significant change involved modifying the `Link` component to pass `subject` and `subjectId` as query parameters to `/homework/invite-expert`, improving functionality by ensuring that context is passed between pages. This was done in multiple attempts, initially using `encodeURIComponent` and subsequently changing to using the `query` prop of the Link component. Finally, the Link component was changed back to a simple button.

`invite-expert\page.jsx` shows a page component for inviting experts.  It uses Redux's `useSelector` to access user data and the custom hook `useAuth` for authentication status. It conditionally renders a different navigation bar depending on whether the user is authenticated. It also renders the `InviteTutors` component. This component was created at 5:08 PM.

`CreateNewProject.js` (created at 5:14 PM) is a significantly larger component for creating new projects. It handles form submission, file uploads using `axiosInstance`, manages project details (title, content, type, subject, deadline, etc.), and integrates with a backend API (`/api/homework/create`) and redirects to an auction page after submission. The component fetches and manages subject categories from localStorage.  Error handling is implemented using `toast` notifications. The component also includes extensive form validation, uses Mantine UI components and Lucide React icons.

Overall, the changes demonstrate iterative development focusing on improving the user experience and functionality of the tutor invitation and project creation features. The repeated edits to `InviteModal.js` highlight the debugging process involved in passing data between pages and the process of iterating on the UI.
