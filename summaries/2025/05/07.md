# Activity Summary for 5/7/2025

## 2:07:27 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `RequestCorrection.js` between 1:56 PM and 2:07 PM on May 7, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, a modal for requesting corrections, remains consistent throughout.  The primary changes involve adding and modifying the UI, specifically the styling and layout of the modal.

Initially, the component was a simple modal with a text area for correction details, a file upload, and "Send" and "Cancel" buttons.  Around 1:56 PM, three additional popups (`RefundPendingPopup`, `OrderNotPaidPopup`, `OpinionCountsPopup`) were integrated. These popups are displayed conditionally based on whether the user clicks "Cancel," "Send," or "Review" respectively. A `handleFinalClose` function was added to perform cleanup after these nested popups close.

Subsequent changes between 1:57 PM and 2:07 PM focused on refining the UI.  These edits primarily involved adjusting CSS class names to control the width (`2xs:w-[...]`, `md:w-full`) of the text area for better responsiveness across different screen sizes.  There were also minor tweaks to padding (`p-2`, `p-4`) and button sizing (`2xs:px-4 2xs:py-2 md:px-6 md:py-2`) for improved visual appeal and consistency. The addition of `overflow-y-auto` to the main `div` suggests improvements to handle content overflow within the modal.  The text size of the action buttons was also modified for improved readability at different screen sizes (`2xs:text-[12px] xs:text-[14px] md:text-[16px]`).  These modifications suggest iterative design improvements based on testing and feedback.

The log shows multiple edits to two React component files: `RequestCorrection.js` and `RefundRequestForm.js`.

`RequestCorrection.js` underwent significant changes between 2:09:09 PM and 2:10:48 PM.  Initially, it was a modal for requesting corrections, featuring a text area, file upload functionality, and "Cancel" and "Send" buttons.  The major update involved the addition of three new pop-up components (`RefundPendingPopup`, `OrderNotPaidPopup`, `OpinionCountsPopup`) displayed based on user interactions with the "Cancel" and "Send" buttons.  The "Send" button now triggers the `OrderNotPaidPopup`, and a new "Review" button triggers `OpinionCountsPopup`. Clicking "Cancel" opens the `RefundPendingPopup`.  A `handleFinalClose` function was added to perform cleanup after closing any of these nested popups. Minor styling adjustments, particularly for button sizes and image sizes across different screen sizes,  were also made within this period.

`RefundRequestForm.js` was modified between 2:15:15 PM and 2:18:08 PM. These edits primarily focused on minor styling adjustments and responsiveness using Tailwind CSS classes.  The changes involved altering text sizes (`2xs`, `xs`, `md`, `lg` classes) for headings and paragraphs to improve visual consistency across different screen sizes. The vertical timeline's styling also experienced some minor tweaks concerning its vertical position.  The most notable change was the reduction in size of the numbered steps within the form.

In summary, the code updates demonstrate a shift in functionality for `RequestCorrection.js` towards a more complex interaction flow with nested popups, while the updates to `RefundRequestForm.js` were primarily cosmetic, enhancing responsiveness and UI consistency.  The frequent updates to `RefundRequestForm.js` suggest iterative refinements to the component's layout and styling.


## 4:07:22 PM
The log shows two revisions of `InviteAndEarn.js`, a React component,  within a minute of each other on May 7, 2025.  Both revisions contain almost identical code, rendering an "Invite and Earn" section with desktop and mobile views. The core functionality and styling remain consistent. The only difference appears to be in the mobile view's heading and supporting text, which is slightly changed to present a different offer and target.  The first revision advertises earning "$25.00" while the second revision changed the offer to "$20 Off".  The referenced images (`/landing-page/project/*.svg`) are also consistent across both revisions.  No significant structural changes or additions/deletions were made to the code.
