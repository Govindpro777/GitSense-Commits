# Activity Summary for 5/7/2025

## 2:07:27 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `RequestCorrection.js` between 1:56 PM and 2:07 PM on May 7, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, a modal for requesting corrections, remains consistent throughout.  The primary changes involve adding and modifying the UI, specifically the styling and layout of the modal.

Initially, the component was a simple modal with a text area for correction details, a file upload, and "Send" and "Cancel" buttons.  Around 1:56 PM, three additional popups (`RefundPendingPopup`, `OrderNotPaidPopup`, `OpinionCountsPopup`) were integrated. These popups are displayed conditionally based on whether the user clicks "Cancel," "Send," or "Review" respectively. A `handleFinalClose` function was added to perform cleanup after these nested popups close.

Subsequent changes between 1:57 PM and 2:07 PM focused on refining the UI.  These edits primarily involved adjusting CSS class names to control the width (`2xs:w-[...]`, `md:w-full`) of the text area for better responsiveness across different screen sizes.  There were also minor tweaks to padding (`p-2`, `p-4`) and button sizing (`2xs:px-4 2xs:py-2 md:px-6 md:py-2`) for improved visual appeal and consistency. The addition of `overflow-y-auto` to the main `div` suggests improvements to handle content overflow within the modal.  The text size of the action buttons was also modified for improved readability at different screen sizes (`2xs:text-[12px] xs:text-[14px] md:text-[16px]`).  These modifications suggest iterative design improvements based on testing and feedback.
