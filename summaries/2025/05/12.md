# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 10:47:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `ProductList.jsx`, a React component likely for managing product data in an admin panel.

The first revision (10:20:46 AM) is a substantial component encompassing product creation functionality.  It utilizes various React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useNavigate`), Redux API slices (`productApiSlice`, `categoryApiSlice`, `brandApiSlice`), and Socket.IO for real-time updates. The component handles numerous product attributes (name, description, price, images, categories, brands, stock, etc.), including slabs (likely for tiered pricing) and coupons.  The `handleSubmit` function prepares and sends product data via a `FormData` object. Notably, it includes logic for handling multiple images, slabs with associated coupons and expiry dates,  and date format conversion within `handleSlabChange`.  Local storage is used to persist form data.

The second revision (10:40:46 AM) completely comments out the entire component, effectively removing all its functionality.

The third revision (10:41:22 AM) reinstates the component, almost identical to the first revision,  with only minor differences.  These differences  appear to be stylistic or very minor code cleanup. There are no functional changes.  The major functionality, including form submission and data handling remains the same.  The core structure and functionality of the component were preserved after the temporary removal.

The `CreateNewProject.js` component was updated on May 12, 2025, at 11:05:34 AM.  This update significantly enhances the project creation and editing functionality.  Key changes include:

* **File Upload:** Added file upload capabilities using a FormData object and axiosInstance.post to `/api/files/upload`.  The component now manages file selection, upload progress (via `isLoading`), and error handling.  Uploaded file information is stored in the `fileResponse` state.  A file removal functionality is also included.

* **Edit Mode:** Implemented edit mode functionality.  The component now checks for an `edit` parameter in the URL search parameters. If present, it fetches existing project details using `axiosInstance.get` to `/api/homework/{homeworkId}` and populates the form with those details.  Successful edits redirect to `/homework/auction/{homeworkId}`.

* **Project Type Expansion:** The `typeOptions` constant now includes a much more extensive list of project types compared to a commented-out shorter list.

* **Subject Category Management:** The component fetches subject categories from localStorage, and manages subject selection based on the chosen category.  The `selectedCategory` and associated subjects are dynamically updated.

* **Data Handling:**  The component uses useState hooks to manage various project details (title, content, type, deadline, word count, etc.).  It uses `axiosInstance` for API calls (both GET and POST/PUT) to handle project creation and updates. The `useAuth` hook and cookies are used for authentication.

* **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks and `toast` notifications informs the user about successes and failures during API calls and file uploads.

* **Data Flow:** The component updates the states based on user interactions and manages the flow of data to the backend APIs for creating and updating projects.  `router.push` handles navigation after successful actions.

The changes suggest a significant improvement in the user interface and the backend interaction for creating and editing projects within the application.  The extensive use of `useEffect` hooks suggests a complex but well-organized component that manages multiple asynchronous operations and data dependencies.
