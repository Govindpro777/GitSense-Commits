# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 10:47:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `ProductList.jsx`, a React component likely for managing product data in an admin panel.

The first revision (10:20:46 AM) is a substantial component encompassing product creation functionality.  It utilizes various React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useNavigate`), Redux API slices (`productApiSlice`, `categoryApiSlice`, `brandApiSlice`), and Socket.IO for real-time updates. The component handles numerous product attributes (name, description, price, images, categories, brands, stock, etc.), including slabs (likely for tiered pricing) and coupons.  The `handleSubmit` function prepares and sends product data via a `FormData` object. Notably, it includes logic for handling multiple images, slabs with associated coupons and expiry dates,  and date format conversion within `handleSlabChange`.  Local storage is used to persist form data.

The second revision (10:40:46 AM) completely comments out the entire component, effectively removing all its functionality.

The third revision (10:41:22 AM) reinstates the component, almost identical to the first revision,  with only minor differences.  These differences  appear to be stylistic or very minor code cleanup. There are no functional changes.  The major functionality, including form submission and data handling remains the same.  The core structure and functionality of the component were preserved after the temporary removal.


## 11:31:52 AM
The `CreateNewProject.js` component was updated on May 12, 2025, at 11:05:34 AM.  This update significantly enhances the project creation and editing functionality.  Key changes include:

* **File Upload:** Added file upload capabilities using a FormData object and axiosInstance.post to `/api/files/upload`.  The component now manages file selection, upload progress (via `isLoading`), and error handling.  Uploaded file information is stored in the `fileResponse` state.  A file removal functionality is also included.

* **Edit Mode:** Implemented edit mode functionality.  The component now checks for an `edit` parameter in the URL search parameters. If present, it fetches existing project details using `axiosInstance.get` to `/api/homework/{homeworkId}` and populates the form with those details.  Successful edits redirect to `/homework/auction/{homeworkId}`.

* **Project Type Expansion:** The `typeOptions` constant now includes a much more extensive list of project types compared to a commented-out shorter list.

* **Subject Category Management:** The component fetches subject categories from localStorage, and manages subject selection based on the chosen category.  The `selectedCategory` and associated subjects are dynamically updated.

* **Data Handling:**  The component uses useState hooks to manage various project details (title, content, type, deadline, word count, etc.).  It uses `axiosInstance` for API calls (both GET and POST/PUT) to handle project creation and updates. The `useAuth` hook and cookies are used for authentication.

* **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks and `toast` notifications informs the user about successes and failures during API calls and file uploads.

* **Data Flow:** The component updates the states based on user interactions and manages the flow of data to the backend APIs for creating and updating projects.  `router.push` handles navigation after successful actions.

The changes suggest a significant improvement in the user interface and the backend interaction for creating and editing projects within the application.  The extensive use of `useEffect` hooks suggests a complex but well-organized component that manages multiple asynchronous operations and data dependencies.


## 11:47:26 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CategoryList.jsx`, a React component for managing categories.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout—creating, updating, and deleting categories—using custom hooks (`useCreateCategoryMutation`, `useUpdateCategoryMutation`, `useDeleteCategoryMutation`, `useFetchCategoriesQuery`)  for interacting with a backend API.  The component also utilizes `react-toastify` for user feedback and `react-redux` for state management.

Early revisions (10:48:19 AM, 10:49:35 AM, 10:59:47 AM) involved primarily commenting and uncommenting large blocks of code, suggesting experimentation or temporary disabling of features.  There's no substantial structural change. The commented code represents the same logic as the uncommented code in the later revisions.

A significant UI overhaul happened between 10:59:47 AM and 11:02:06 AM.  The component's rendering shifted from a simpler layout to a more sophisticated design using a grid system (`grid grid-cols-*`) to organize an Admin menu, category creation form, and a category list.  This revision also introduces better handling for empty category lists and includes loading states with appropriate visual cues.  There is an addition of icons and improved styling overall.

Subsequent revisions (11:03:20 AM, 11:03:32 AM, 11:04:18 AM, 11:04:38 AM) focused on minor stylistic adjustments and the removal of unnecessary `border` classes from various elements.  Finally, at 11:04:57 AM the component reverts back to the structure seen in the revisions around 10:49:35 AM, removing the more advanced UI enhancements introduced around 11:02:06 AM.  This final revision removes the more advanced grid-based layout and returns to a simpler structure.  The core functionality for creating, updating, and deleting categories remains unchanged.
