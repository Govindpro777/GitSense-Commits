# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 10:47:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `ProductList.jsx`, a React component likely for managing product data in an admin panel.

The first revision (10:20:46 AM) is a substantial component encompassing product creation functionality.  It utilizes various React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useNavigate`), Redux API slices (`productApiSlice`, `categoryApiSlice`, `brandApiSlice`), and Socket.IO for real-time updates. The component handles numerous product attributes (name, description, price, images, categories, brands, stock, etc.), including slabs (likely for tiered pricing) and coupons.  The `handleSubmit` function prepares and sends product data via a `FormData` object. Notably, it includes logic for handling multiple images, slabs with associated coupons and expiry dates,  and date format conversion within `handleSlabChange`.  Local storage is used to persist form data.

The second revision (10:40:46 AM) completely comments out the entire component, effectively removing all its functionality.

The third revision (10:41:22 AM) reinstates the component, almost identical to the first revision,  with only minor differences.  These differences  appear to be stylistic or very minor code cleanup. There are no functional changes.  The major functionality, including form submission and data handling remains the same.  The core structure and functionality of the component were preserved after the temporary removal.


## 11:31:52 AM
The `CreateNewProject.js` component was updated on May 12, 2025, at 11:05:34 AM.  This update significantly enhances the project creation and editing functionality.  Key changes include:

* **File Upload:** Added file upload capabilities using a FormData object and axiosInstance.post to `/api/files/upload`.  The component now manages file selection, upload progress (via `isLoading`), and error handling.  Uploaded file information is stored in the `fileResponse` state.  A file removal functionality is also included.

* **Edit Mode:** Implemented edit mode functionality.  The component now checks for an `edit` parameter in the URL search parameters. If present, it fetches existing project details using `axiosInstance.get` to `/api/homework/{homeworkId}` and populates the form with those details.  Successful edits redirect to `/homework/auction/{homeworkId}`.

* **Project Type Expansion:** The `typeOptions` constant now includes a much more extensive list of project types compared to a commented-out shorter list.

* **Subject Category Management:** The component fetches subject categories from localStorage, and manages subject selection based on the chosen category.  The `selectedCategory` and associated subjects are dynamically updated.

* **Data Handling:**  The component uses useState hooks to manage various project details (title, content, type, deadline, word count, etc.).  It uses `axiosInstance` for API calls (both GET and POST/PUT) to handle project creation and updates. The `useAuth` hook and cookies are used for authentication.

* **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks and `toast` notifications informs the user about successes and failures during API calls and file uploads.

* **Data Flow:** The component updates the states based on user interactions and manages the flow of data to the backend APIs for creating and updating projects.  `router.push` handles navigation after successful actions.

The changes suggest a significant improvement in the user interface and the backend interaction for creating and editing projects within the application.  The extensive use of `useEffect` hooks suggests a complex but well-organized component that manages multiple asynchronous operations and data dependencies.


## 11:47:26 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CategoryList.jsx`, a React component for managing categories.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout—creating, updating, and deleting categories—using custom hooks (`useCreateCategoryMutation`, `useUpdateCategoryMutation`, `useDeleteCategoryMutation`, `useFetchCategoriesQuery`)  for interacting with a backend API.  The component also utilizes `react-toastify` for user feedback and `react-redux` for state management.

Early revisions (10:48:19 AM, 10:49:35 AM, 10:59:47 AM) involved primarily commenting and uncommenting large blocks of code, suggesting experimentation or temporary disabling of features.  There's no substantial structural change. The commented code represents the same logic as the uncommented code in the later revisions.

A significant UI overhaul happened between 10:59:47 AM and 11:02:06 AM.  The component's rendering shifted from a simpler layout to a more sophisticated design using a grid system (`grid grid-cols-*`) to organize an Admin menu, category creation form, and a category list.  This revision also introduces better handling for empty category lists and includes loading states with appropriate visual cues.  There is an addition of icons and improved styling overall.

Subsequent revisions (11:03:20 AM, 11:03:32 AM, 11:04:18 AM, 11:04:38 AM) focused on minor stylistic adjustments and the removal of unnecessary `border` classes from various elements.  Finally, at 11:04:57 AM the component reverts back to the structure seen in the revisions around 10:49:35 AM, removing the more advanced UI enhancements introduced around 11:02:06 AM.  This final revision removes the more advanced grid-based layout and returns to a simpler structure.  The core functionality for creating, updating, and deleting categories remains unchanged.


## 2:01:22 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `next.config.mjs` and `CreateNewProject.js`.

`next.config.mjs` was modified three times between 1:36 PM and 1:39 PM on May 12, 2025.  These changes involved adjusting the list of allowed image domains within the `images` configuration. Specifically,  "instaxpert-student-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com" was added and then later removed from the array of allowed domains.  The rest of the configuration, including `eslint`, `reactStrictMode`, `env`, `experimental`, and `webpack` settings, remained consistent across these revisions.

`CreateNewProject.js` was updated once at 1:53 PM on May 12, 2025. This substantial change involved adding significant frontend functionality for creating and editing projects.  Key updates include:

* **File Upload:** Added features for file selection, upload using  `axiosInstance` to `/api/files/upload`, and display of file name. Error handling and success messages are also implemented using `toast`.
* **Project Editing:** Implemented functionality to edit existing projects by fetching data using `axiosInstance`  to `/api/homework/{homeworkId}` based on URL parameters. The update uses a PUT request to  `/api/homework/{homeworkId}`.
* **Category and Subject Management:**  The code fetches and manages subject categories and subjects from `localStorage`, updating the available subjects dynamically based on the selected category.
* **Form Handling:** Improved form handling with enhanced state management for project details, including deadline (`DateTimePicker`), project type (`typeOptions`), word count, and order type.
* **API Interactions:**  The component extensively uses `axiosInstance` to interact with the backend API for project creation (`POST /api/homework/create`) and updates.  Authentication is handled via JWT tokens obtained from cookies or the `authContext`.  Error handling and success messages are displayed using `toast`.


The `CreateNewProject.js` file demonstrates a complete form for project creation and editing, integrated with backend APIs for data persistence and file management.  The changes to `next.config.mjs` are minor in comparison, focusing solely on adjusting allowed image domains.


## 4:21:41 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `BidTutorList.js` and `ExpertCard.js`, both located in the `src\components\landingPage\Project` directory of a React frontend application.  The changes span a period from 3:40 PM to 4:19 PM on May 12, 2025.

**`BidTutorList.js` Updates:**

The `BidTutorList.js` file underwent two significant updates.  Both revisions focused on importing necessary modules and converting the component from a commented-out functional component to a fully functional one using `useRef` and `useRef` hooks for handling state and external click management.  This suggests a refactoring effort to improve functionality and maintainability.  The component fetches tutor bids using `axiosInstance` based on `homeworkId`, `userId`, and `jwtToken`. The component also includes client-side sorting functionality for the tutor bids.

**`ExpertCard.js` Updates:**

The `ExpertCard.js` file was modified multiple times throughout the logged period.  The changes primarily involved refinements to the styling and layout of the `TutorCard` component, particularly its responsive design for different screen sizes (using Tailwind CSS classes).  The updates adjust the sizes of images and text across various screen sizes (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) showing a focus on enhancing the user interface.  A modal for explaining the payment process was added and improved.


The recurring pattern in both files is the extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The commented-out code in the initial revisions of both files suggests iterative development and testing before committing the final versions. The consistent timestamps close together indicate a focused development sprint on these components.


## 5:21:40 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `ExpertCard.js` on May 12, 2025.  All changes appear to be minor adjustments, primarily focused on styling and responsiveness within the component.  There are no discernible changes to core functionality.  The timestamps indicate a period of focused editing between approximately 4:56 PM and 5:20 PM.  The code consistently displays a React component rendering a card, likely for displaying expert profiles, using `next/image` for image rendering and `lucide-react` for icons.  The repeated code suggests iterative refinements to the visual presentation rather than substantial functional alterations.


## 5:31:01 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `CategoryList.jsx` and `BrandList.jsx`.  Both files are React components for managing categories and brands respectively, within an admin panel.

**`CategoryList.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):**

The `CategoryList.jsx` file underwent several iterations between 4:33 PM and 4:38 PM.  The core functionality remained consistent throughout: fetching, creating, updating, and deleting categories.  Significant changes include:

* **4:33 PM - 4:35 PM:**  The most substantial change involved the addition of loading states (`isLoading`) to the mutation hooks (`useCreateCategoryMutation`, `useUpdateCategoryMutation`, `useDeleteCategoryMutation`).  This improves user experience by providing feedback during asynchronous operations.  An `AdminMenu` component was also added.


* **4:35 PM - 4:38 PM:**  The `AdminMenu` component's code was commented out in several revisions, suggesting experimentation or a temporary removal. The final revision of the component included commented out code.

* **Overall Pattern:** The code consistently uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), Redux for state management (`useSelector`), and a custom API slice (`categoryApiSlice`) for interacting with a backend. Error handling and toast notifications are implemented for user feedback.  The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS.


**`BrandList.jsx` (Two Revisions):**

The `BrandList.jsx` file shows revisions at 4:55 PM and 4:58 PM and then a final revision at 5:07 PM.  This component mirrors the structure of `CategoryList.jsx`, managing brands instead of categories.

* **4:55 PM - 5:07 PM:** The initial revision was a commented out version of the component. The second revision at 4:58 PM was very similar to the commented-out version with the only difference being that the commented out code was now uncommented and running. The final revision at 5:07 PM involved a significant UI overhaul. The layout transitioned from a simple, vertically stacked structure to a more sophisticated grid-based design that displays brand cards.  Error handling was also simplified.

* **Overall Pattern:**  `BrandList.jsx` also utilizes React hooks, Redux, a custom API slice (`brandApiSlice`), and Tailwind CSS for styling. The structure closely resembles `CategoryList.jsx`, highlighting a consistent coding style and approach to data handling across the admin panel.  The changes demonstrate a focus on enhancing UI/UX, particularly in the presentation of brand information and the overall design of the component.

In summary, the changes reflect iterative development, improvements in error handling and UI design, and a consistent architectural pattern across the two admin panel components. The `AdminMenu` component underwent some experimentation and the `BrandList` component received a major UI refresh.


## 6:21:43 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `ExpertCard.js`, a React component, over a short period on May 12, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, displaying expert information (name, image, badges, ratings, bio, etc.), remained consistent throughout all the changes.  The edits primarily focused on minor adjustments to styling and layout using Tailwind CSS classes.  These adjustments involved tweaking sizes (`w-[]`, `h-[]`), margins (`mb-[]`, `mt-[]`, `ml-[]`), padding (`p-[]`, `px-[]`, `py-[]`), and spacing (`gap-[]`) for various screen sizes (xs, sm, md, lg, xl).  There are also no significant code changes beyond these styling alterations.  The timestamps indicate a period of intense activity between approximately 5:23 PM and 5:30 PM, followed by further minor adjustments later in the evening.  The repetitive nature of the code changes suggests fine-tuning for responsiveness and visual improvements rather than substantial functional updates.


## 7:21:36 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ExpertCard.js` throughout the evening of May 12th, 2025.  The file is a React component displaying expert cards, likely for a tutoring or expert service platform.  The code remains largely unchanged across revisions, focusing on responsive design adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  No functional changes are apparent in the `ExpertCard.js` file across the multiple commits.

The `next.config.mjs` file was modified twice within a short period (6:42 PM). These changes involved adding  `"instaxpert-student-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com"` to the list of allowed image domains.  This suggests the addition of a new S3 bucket for student uploads.  The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable is set, indicating the configuration of an API endpoint.
