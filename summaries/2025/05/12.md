# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 10:47:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `ProductList.jsx`, a React component likely for managing product data in an admin panel.

The first revision (10:20:46 AM) is a substantial component encompassing product creation functionality.  It utilizes various React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useNavigate`), Redux API slices (`productApiSlice`, `categoryApiSlice`, `brandApiSlice`), and Socket.IO for real-time updates. The component handles numerous product attributes (name, description, price, images, categories, brands, stock, etc.), including slabs (likely for tiered pricing) and coupons.  The `handleSubmit` function prepares and sends product data via a `FormData` object. Notably, it includes logic for handling multiple images, slabs with associated coupons and expiry dates,  and date format conversion within `handleSlabChange`.  Local storage is used to persist form data.

The second revision (10:40:46 AM) completely comments out the entire component, effectively removing all its functionality.

The third revision (10:41:22 AM) reinstates the component, almost identical to the first revision,  with only minor differences.  These differences  appear to be stylistic or very minor code cleanup. There are no functional changes.  The major functionality, including form submission and data handling remains the same.  The core structure and functionality of the component were preserved after the temporary removal.
