# Activity Summary for 2/23/2025

The `CustomerList.jsx` component was updated on February 23, 2025, at 10:40:58 PM.  This update significantly enhances the component's functionality for managing customer orders.  The key changes include:

* **Backend Integration:** The component now fetches order data (`/api/orders/orders`) and laundry categories (`/api/laundry/categories`) from a backend API using `axios`. Error handling is included for both API calls.

* **Order Creation:** A new order can be created via a modal form.  The form includes fields for customer details (name, contact, address), laundry items (category, subcategory, quantity, price), remarks, and calculates the total amount.  The order is then submitted to the backend (`/api/orders/create-order`) via another `axios` POST request.  Successful and unsuccessful submissions are handled with toast notifications.

* **UI Enhancements:**  The UI includes a date picker for filtering orders, a modal for adding new customers, and a table displaying fetched order data (date, order ID, customer name, total amount, quantity, payment status).  React icons are used for visual elements.  The form's input validation is improved (checking for required fields).

* **State Management:**  The component uses `useState` hooks extensively to manage form data, fetched categories and subcategories, order items, total amount, and the modal's visibility.  `useEffect` hooks are utilized to fetch data on component mount.  Data flow is carefully managed to ensure that changes in one field trigger updates in others (e.g., selecting a category updates subcategories and price).

* **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Robust error handling is implemented throughout the component, providing informative error messages to the user through toast notifications. Input validation and error handling enhances the user experience and prevents unexpected behavior.


The code demonstrates a well-structured React component with clear separation of concerns and effective use of state management and asynchronous operations. The use of `axios` for API communication and React's built in functionalities like `useState` and `useEffect`  makes the code efficient and maintainable.
