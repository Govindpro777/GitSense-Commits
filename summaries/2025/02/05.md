# Activity Summary for 2/5/2025

## 11:31:59 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `Navbar.jsx` between 11:28 AM and 11:30 AM on February 5th, 2025.  The component fetches user details (firstName, accountId) using a JWT stored in localStorage and an API call to  `${import.meta.env.VITE_APP_BASE_URL}user/getUserById/${id}`.  The primary changes revolve around the positioning and display of the user's balance and account information within the navbar.  Specifically:

* **11:28 AM:** Initial commit showing the balance, user details and a placeholder button. The balance label (`Balance: ${userData.price}`) is present, but `userData.price` is undefined resulting in an empty balance display.

* **11:29 AM - 11:30 AM:** Several commits focus on rearranging UI elements. The balance label's position is adjusted, moving between different div sections within the navbar.  A button element is added and removed from the navbar during this time. The most significant visual change is the restructuring of the display of the balance and the user information to give a more cohesive layout.

* **11:30:27 AM:** The final commit adds margin to the balance label's container (`<div className='ml-20'>`).


Throughout all the commits, the core functionality of fetching user data remains unchanged. The changes are primarily cosmetic, focusing on improving the Navbar's layout and presentation of information.  The `userData.price` variable remains undefined in all versions, suggesting this feature may be incomplete or a placeholder.
