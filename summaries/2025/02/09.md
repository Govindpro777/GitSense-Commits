# Activity Summary for 2/9/2025

## 11:41:23 AM
The log shows development on a laundry management application's React frontend.  Significant changes occurred between 2:00 AM and 2:20 AM and again around 11:00 AM.

**`AddSupply.jsx`:**  This component, for adding new supplies, underwent a minor revision at 2:05 AM. The primary changes were cosmetic, refining the styling (e.g., changing class names from `rounded-md` to `rounded-lg`, adjusting padding and font styles) and removing some options from the select elements. The core functionality of handling form data remained unchanged.

**`App.jsx`:** This file, representing the main application, was updated at 2:00 AM and 10:56 AM. The 2:00 AM update established the routing structure of the application using `react-router-dom`, defining routes for various sections like customers, supplies, inventory, and so on. The 10:56 AM update added a route for an `EmployeeList` component.

**`Sidebar.jsx`:** This component, responsible for the application's sidebar navigation, saw updates at 2:08 AM and 11:09 AM. The 2:08 AM update created the basic sidebar structure with navigation links to different parts of the application.  The 11:09 AM update mainly focused on cosmetic changes to styling, such as changing the color of the header text and slightly adjusting spacing.  No functional changes are evident in the diff. The updates at 11:10 AM and 11:12 AM made further minor stylistic adjustments to padding and spacing within the sidebar.


**`CustomerList.jsx`:** This component, displaying a list of customers, was extensively modified between 2:10 AM and 2:21 AM.  The initial version at 2:10 AM showed a basic customer list table with status indicators. Subsequent changes added buttons for adding new customers (using a `PlusIcon` from `@heroicons/react/24/outline`) and modifying the "Add Customer" button to use a `NavLink` to `/add-supply` at approximately 2:15 AM. Further refinements involved styling adjustments, mainly to the button, making it smaller and altering the icon size. The final change at 2:21 AM adjusted the margins of the main `div` to center the content better.


**`EmployeeList.jsx`:** This component, for displaying employee information, was added to the application at 10:48 AM.  The initial version presented a simple table of employees.  Subsequent modifications between 10:48 AM and 11:21 AM primarily involved styling the "Add Employee" button by adding background color (`bg-yellow-300`) and refining the shape and padding.  The plus icon was also restyled. Finally, the button text was changed from "Create Laundry" to "Add Employee".


**`Navbar.jsx`:** This component, for the application's navigation bar, was created at 11:02 AM and then underwent several stylistic refinements until 11:18 AM. The most significant functional change was at approximately 11:17 AM where a dropdown icon (`ChevronDownIcon` from `lucide-react`) was added next to the "Create Laundry" button.  The styling of the plus icon and the "Create Laundry" button underwent several iterations, involving color and background adjustments. The search bar was also modified to reduce padding (`py-2` changed to `py-1`).


**Recurring Elements:** Throughout the log, there's consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling, and frequent use of icons from `@heroicons/react/24/outline` and `lucide-react`.  The majority of the later changes appear to focus on improving the visual appearance and consistency of the UI elements.
