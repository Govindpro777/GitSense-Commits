# Activity Summary for 2/21/2025

## 12:03:52 PM
On February 21, 2025, at 11:13:20 AM,  `authController.js` was updated. This file contains controllers for user authentication (signup, login, password change, email verification using OTP), and CRUD operations for laundry categories.  The authentication methods use bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token generation.  Error handling is implemented throughout, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.  The code also includes functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting laundry categories using the `LaundryCategory` model.


Five minutes later, at 11:13:35 AM, `laundaryRoutes.js` was updated to define express routes for the laundry category controllers (create, read, update, delete) defined in `authController.js`.  This suggests that the laundry category functionality was added as part of a single commit or update.  The routes are concise and follow RESTful conventions.

The `LaundaryCategoryList.jsx` component underwent significant revisions between 10:15 AM and 11:39 AM on February 21, 2025.  Initially, the component fetched laundry categories from a backend API (`BASE_URL/api/laundry/categories`) and rendered them in a table.  A modal for adding new categories was implemented, allowing for the input of a category name and multiple subcategories with prices.  The initial implementation used `axios.post` to add new categories and `window.location.reload()` to refresh the page after adding or deleting categories.  

Subsequent changes introduced functionality to edit existing categories.  The edit functionality went through several iterations:  Initially using `isEditing` and `editCategoryId` states, then transitioning to using an `editCategory` state for easier management. The `handleSubmit` function was modified to handle both adding new categories and updating existing ones, with the later version using `axios.put` for updates, and the update no longer requiring a full page reload.  The `handleDeleteCategory` function was also modified to remove subcategories individually without a full page refresh, and then reverted to the full page reload version.  Error handling and loading states (`loading`, `error`) were added to improve user experience.  Finally, the component was simplified, removing commented-out code.

The `CustomerList.jsx` component was also modified between 11:43 AM and 11:54 AM.  Initially, it displayed a static list of customers with sample data.  A modal was added for adding new customers, allowing for input fields for various details.  The final version introduces  `useEffect` hooks to fetch laundry categories and subcategories from a backend API (`BASE_URL/api/laundry-categories` and `BASE_URL/api/subcategories`), dynamically populating the respective select options in the modal. The `handleChange` function was updated to handle changes to form data, including correctly updating `subCategories` based on the selected `laundryCategory` and resetting the `subCategory` selection when the `laundryCategory` is changed.  The placeholder URLs for API calls in earlier versions of this file were replaced with the dynamic `BASE_URL`.
