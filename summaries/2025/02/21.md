# Activity Summary for 2/21/2025

## 12:03:52 PM
On February 21, 2025, at 11:13:20 AM,  `authController.js` was updated. This file contains controllers for user authentication (signup, login, password change, email verification using OTP), and CRUD operations for laundry categories.  The authentication methods use bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token generation.  Error handling is implemented throughout, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.  The code also includes functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting laundry categories using the `LaundryCategory` model.


Five minutes later, at 11:13:35 AM, `laundaryRoutes.js` was updated to define express routes for the laundry category controllers (create, read, update, delete) defined in `authController.js`.  This suggests that the laundry category functionality was added as part of a single commit or update.  The routes are concise and follow RESTful conventions.
