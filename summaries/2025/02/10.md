# Activity Summary for 2/10/2025

## 10:56:22 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `CustomerList.jsx` and `LaundaryCategoryList.jsx` components, and to `App.jsx`  between February 9th and 10th, 2025.  `EmployeeList.jsx` was also added and significantly modified.


**`CustomerList.jsx` Changes:**

The `CustomerList.jsx` component underwent numerous revisions between 8:11 PM and 8:26 PM on February 9th, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the UI/UX of the customer list table. The initial versions used custom SVG icons and a more complex status rendering mechanism.  Later versions switched to using `react-icons/fa` and `@heroicons/react/24/outline` for icons, simplifying the code and the table presentation. The number of sample customers displayed was also adjusted in several iterations (from 3 to 10, then 9, then back to 8).  The table's styling (e.g., `text-center`, `p-3`, `max-w-5xl`) changed, and the overall layout was modified.  The route for adding customers (`/add-supply`) remained constant.  Significant changes occurred around 8:14 PM and 8:16 PM.

**`LaundaryCategoryList.jsx` Changes:**

This component was created around 8:19 PM on February 9th, 2025.  It shares a similar structure to the final version of `CustomerList.jsx`, using `react-icons/fa` and `@heroicons/react/24/outline` for icons and presenting data in a table format.  A minor update at 8:19:13 PM adjusted the `mx-auto` class for better centering.  The component displays laundry categories. The route for adding new categories is `/add-supply`, which is the same as in `CustomerList`.

**`App.jsx` Changes:**

The `App.jsx` routing configuration was updated twice on February 10th, 2025.  The first update at 9:59:18 AM initially omitted the `/employees-list` route.  It was then added in the second update at 9:59:46 AM, indicating the addition of the `EmployeeList` component to the application.

**`EmployeeList.jsx` Changes:**

The `EmployeeList.jsx` component was created and substantially modified on February 10th, 2025.  The initial version was a simple placeholder.  A more developed version was added at 10:39:25 AM, showing a table with employee data (name, area, salary), edit and delete functionalities using icons, and pagination.  A dedicated "Add Employee" button is also present.

**Recurring Elements:**

*   Consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
*   Use of icons from `react-icons/fa` and `@heroicons/react/24/outline`.
*   The `/add-supply` route appears repeatedly in both `CustomerList` and `LaundaryCategoryList`, suggesting a potential inconsistency in routing.




## 3:11:32 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Navbar.jsx` between 10:56 AM and 11:06 AM on February 10, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved refactoring the icons used in the navigation bar.  Initially, the code included `MagnifyingGlassIcon`, `BellIcon`, `CalendarIcon`, `PlusIcon`, and `ChevronDownIcon` from various libraries. In the final revision at 11:06 AM, `BellIcon` and `CalendarIcon` were removed and replaced with custom SVG icons for the notification and calendar functionalities.  A small red circle was added to the notification button for emphasis.

The `EmployeeList.jsx` component was updated twice at 3:06 PM and 3:07 PM on February 10, 2025. The only significant change between these two commits was the addition of an "Action" column to the employee table.  This column contains buttons represented by `FaPencilAlt` and `FaTrash` icons for editing and deleting employees, respectively.

The `CustomerList.jsx` component underwent several revisions at 3:07 PM on February 10, 2025. The final version uses a simplified design, displaying customer data in a table with an avatar image for each customer, using icons from `react-icons/fa`  (`FaCalendarAlt`, `FaEye`) and `@heroicons/react/24/outline` (`PlusIcon`).  The styling was cleaned up and the commented-out code was removed from the file.  A significant change is the switch from placeholder data arrays to using `Array(8).fill({})` for generating placeholder data.  The `Add Customer` button was updated to use `NavLink` from `react-router-dom` for better routing.
