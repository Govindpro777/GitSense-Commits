# Activity Summary for 2/14/2025

## 10:10:00 AM
The log shows development of authentication features for a laundry management application.  The key changes span from 9:13 AM to 9:24 AM on February 14, 2025.

`authController.js` (backend): This file remained largely unchanged throughout the log, containing the core authentication logic for signup, OTP verification, and login using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token generation.  The initial version (9:13 AM) and the final version (9:20 AM) are identical. The code implements email verification via OTP.

`OTPVerification.jsx` (frontend):  The main change here (between 9:16 AM and 9:24 AM)  added error handling. The component now checks if the email is missing, providing a more robust user experience by redirecting to signup if necessary.


`Signup.jsx` (frontend): This component underwent several minor revisions between 9:17 AM and 9:19 AM.  These revisions focused on correcting how the email address was passed to the OTP verification page after signup.  Initially, there was a bug where the email wasn't correctly passed; this was fixed in later commits. The component's functionality remained consistent:  handling user input for signup and navigating to OTP verification upon successful submission.  The `confirm password` input field was commented out in all versions.


The overall pattern shows iterative development, primarily focused on frontend improvements and bug fixes related to data passing between the signup and OTP verification components.  The backend authentication logic remained stable.

The log shows development activity on a laundry management application's backend and frontend.

**Backend (authController.js):**  The `authController.js` file underwent multiple revisions between 11:26 AM and 11:31 AM on February 14, 2025.  These revisions did not change the core functionality; the code remained consistent across all revisions, implementing user signup (with OTP verification), and login functionalities using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for authentication.  The only difference seems to be a stray 'e' character at the end of the second revision.

**Frontend:**

* **Sidebar.jsx (11:30 AM & 11:34 AM):** The sidebar component was updated. The initial change at 11:30 AM added a mobile menu button. A subsequent update at 11:34 AM  modified the `logOut` function to include `navigate("/login")` using `react-router-dom's` `useNavigate` hook, redirecting the user to the login page after logout.  The sidebar itself contains navigation links for various features of the laundry management system (dashboard, customer list, laundry categories, etc.).

* **Login.jsx (11:40 AM & 11:41 AM):**  The login component was slightly modified. The change between 11:40 AM and 11:41 AM simplified the navigation after a successful login; the `replace: true` option was removed from  `navigate("/", { replace: true })`,  meaning the login page will not be added to the browser history. The component uses Axios to make API calls to the backend for login authentication.

* **Dashboard.jsx (11:43 AM - 11:46 AM):** The dashboard component, displaying various charts and data, underwent several revisions.  The most significant change involved adding authentication at 11:45 AM and subsequent refactoring.  An `useEffect` hook was introduced to check for a token in local storage and redirect the user to the login page if the token is missing.  This enhancement protects the dashboard route, making it accessible only to logged-in users. The component renders charts using Recharts, displaying revenue, order time, and order data.


* **App.jsx (11:47 AM & 11:48 AM):** The main application routing was modified. The initial version had commented out code. The final version at 11:48 AM introduced separate routes for signup and login without the Navbar and Sidebar, and all other routes now redirect to a dashboard route instead of a root path. This improved the application's structure and user experience.  The routes define the structure of the application, linking various components together.  The changes reflect the addition of authentication to several components.
