# Activity Summary for 2/14/2025

## 10:10:00 AM
The log shows development of authentication features for a laundry management application.  The key changes span from 9:13 AM to 9:24 AM on February 14, 2025.

`authController.js` (backend): This file remained largely unchanged throughout the log, containing the core authentication logic for signup, OTP verification, and login using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token generation.  The initial version (9:13 AM) and the final version (9:20 AM) are identical. The code implements email verification via OTP.

`OTPVerification.jsx` (frontend):  The main change here (between 9:16 AM and 9:24 AM)  added error handling. The component now checks if the email is missing, providing a more robust user experience by redirecting to signup if necessary.


`Signup.jsx` (frontend): This component underwent several minor revisions between 9:17 AM and 9:19 AM.  These revisions focused on correcting how the email address was passed to the OTP verification page after signup.  Initially, there was a bug where the email wasn't correctly passed; this was fixed in later commits. The component's functionality remained consistent:  handling user input for signup and navigating to OTP verification upon successful submission.  The `confirm password` input field was commented out in all versions.


The overall pattern shows iterative development, primarily focused on frontend improvements and bug fixes related to data passing between the signup and OTP verification components.  The backend authentication logic remained stable.
