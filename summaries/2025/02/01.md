# Activity Summary for 2/1/2025

## 1:03:32 AM
The `resetPassword.js` controller underwent significant changes between 12:30 AM and 1:02 AM on February 1st, 2025.

The initial version (12:30 AM) implemented password reset using a randomly generated token stored directly in the user document,  sent via email using Nodemailer with credentials from environment variables.  It used `crypto` for token generation and `bcrypt` for password hashing.  The email included a link with a token valid for one hour.  Both `forgotPassword` and `resetPassword` functions were defined within the module.


The revised version (1:02 AM) replaced the custom token generation with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) generated using `jsonwebtoken`.  The token's lifespan was shortened to 15 minutes.  It also simplified the email template and error handling.  The `forgotPassword` function now returns a more concise success message, and the  `resetPassword`  function now extracts the token from the request parameters (`req.params`) instead of the request body (`req.body`).  The code was also restructured to use `exports` for exporting functions.  Error handling was also improved, with more specific error messages and including the error object in the response for debugging purposes in the `forgotPassword` function.  The bcrypt library was changed from `require("bcrypt")` to `require("bcryptjs")`.  Environment variables were shortened (e.g., `EMAIL_USER` instead of `EMAIL_USERNAME`).  The code uses a `BASE_URL` environment variable for constructing the reset link.


## 2:03:35 AM
The log shows development of password reset functionality in a Node.js backend application.

Initially,  `reset.js` (1:04:05 AM) and `resetPassword.js` (1:04:41 AM) were created to handle password reset requests, using JWT for token generation and nodemailer for email delivery.  The `.env` file was updated multiple times (1:05:04 AM, 1:05:37 AM, 1:16:45 AM, 1:16:53 AM) to add environment variables like `FRONTEND_URL`, `EMAIL_USER`, and `EMAIL_PASS`.  Note that these values are sensitive and were redacted for security reasons.

`app.js` underwent several changes.  Around 1:07:57 AM and 1:08:39 AM, it was updated to include the new password reset routes, with the route being adjusted to `/api/v1/auth` by 1:09:01 AM.

There was a brief period (1:37:25 AM, 1:38:06 AM)  where the `reset.js` file had a pathing error in the `require` statement that was quickly corrected.

Finally, the `User` model in `User.js` was modified (1:42:27 AM, 1:42:41 AM, 1:43:20 AM) to include `token` and `tokenExpires` fields, and a pre-save middleware was added to hash passwords using bcrypt before saving to the database.  This indicates improvements in user security and a more robust password reset process.  The addition of `tokenExpires` suggests enhancements to token management.


## 5:35:23 AM
The log shows development of authentication features in a React frontend application.

**`ForgotPassword.jsx`**:  This component, first appearing at 2:00:32 AM, handles the forgot password functionality.  It allows users to input their email address to receive a password reset link.  A later update at 2:30:16 AM removed the display of the message returned from the API.


**`router.jsx`**: This file, managing the application routes, underwent multiple changes. At 2:00:53 AM, the initial routes were defined, including paths for `/trade`, `/support`, `/history`, `/profile`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/plans`, `/buy`, and `/admin`. At 2:01:52 AM, a route for password reset (`/reset-password`) was added.  Finally, at 2:08:33 AM, the `/reset-password` route was changed to `/forgot-password`  to align with the `ForgotPassword` component.


**`LoginForm.jsx`**: This component, first appearing at 2:03:53 AM, handles user login.  It uses axios to make a POST request to the backend for authentication.  The component was modified multiple times between 2:03:53 AM and 2:09:31 AM.  These changes involved adding and refining the UI element for the "Forgot Password?" functionality,  making the button functional by adding a `handleForgotPassword` function and navigating the user to the `/forgot-password` route.  The styling of the UI elements was also slightly adjusted in these repeated updates.  The final version of `LoginForm.jsx` (2:09:31 AM) includes a "Forgot Password?" button that directs users to the correct route.

In summary, the code changes reflect the iterative development of authentication features, including login, signup, and password reset. The `LoginForm` component received the most updates as the team likely worked on implementing and refining the "Forgot Password" functionality.  A consistent pattern is the use of `axios` for API calls and  `react-router-dom` for navigation.  The styling consistently uses Tailwind CSS classes.


## 11:06:48 AM
The codebase implements password reset functionality.  Between 2:20 AM and 2:27 AM on February 1st, 2025, several files were updated.

`sendEmail.js`:  Initially (2:20 AM), this file contained hardcoded email credentials.  A later revision (2:27 AM) improved security by loading credentials from environment variables (`process.env.EMAIL_USER`, `process.env.EMAIL_PASS`, `process.env.FRONTEND_URL`). The reset email URL is now dynamically generated using the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable.

`resetPassword.js`: This controller (2:20 AM) handles both the forgot password and reset password requests.  It generates a random reset token, stores it in the `User` model, and sends a reset email using `sendEmail.js`.  It also verifies tokens upon reset, checking for expiration.

`reset.js`: This file (2:21 AM) defines the routes (`/forgot-password` and `/reset-password`) for the password reset functionality, mapping them to the controllers in `resetPassword.js`.

`User.js`:  The `User` model underwent a significant change. The initial version (2:21 AM) lacked fields for password reset. A subsequent update (2:23 AM) added `resetPasswordToken` and `resetPasswordExpire` fields to store the reset token and its expiration time, respectively.

The overall pattern shows a well-structured approach to password reset, separating concerns into models, controllers, routes, and utility functions. The final commit improves security by externalizing sensitive information to environment variables.


## 11:06:51 AM
The log shows a series of rapid modifications to `AdminPanel.jsx` between 10:26 AM and 10:46 AM on February 1st, 2025.  These changes primarily involve the Admin Panel's sidebar. Initially, the sidebar contained commented-out sections for "New User," "Feedback," "Help," and "Shortcuts" buttons.  These were subsequently removed completely.

Over this period, the sidebar was updated to include "Notifications" and "Logout" buttons.  The icon imports for these buttons were added in stages, with some initial redundancy in import statements.  The styling and placement of the "Notifications" and "Logout" buttons in the sidebar also underwent several iterations.  At some point the style for the logout button changed to a lighter shade of blue, changing from `bg-red-600` to `bg-[#0f6dd3]/20`.  Finally, a button to view "All Users" was added and later commented out, indicating potential changes to the overall user management flow.  The position of the Notifications and Logout buttons changed, and finally a `mt` (margin-top) value was added to the button container, indicating adjustments to layout and positioning.


The `ForgotPassword.jsx` and `LoginForm.jsx` files were modified at approximately 11:03 AM and 11:03:55 AM respectively, indicating separate updates to the authentication components of the application.  The `LoginForm.jsx` file uses `import.meta.env.VITE_APP_BASE_URL` which indicates environment variables are used to handle the base URL configuration for API requests. The `router.jsx` file was updated at 11:04:17 AM, reflecting the addition of the `/admin` route, making the Admin Panel accessible through the application's routing system.
