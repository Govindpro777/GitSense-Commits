# Activity Summary for 2/1/2025

## 1:03:32 AM
The `resetPassword.js` controller underwent significant changes between 12:30 AM and 1:02 AM on February 1st, 2025.

The initial version (12:30 AM) implemented password reset using a randomly generated token stored directly in the user document,  sent via email using Nodemailer with credentials from environment variables.  It used `crypto` for token generation and `bcrypt` for password hashing.  The email included a link with a token valid for one hour.  Both `forgotPassword` and `resetPassword` functions were defined within the module.


The revised version (1:02 AM) replaced the custom token generation with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) generated using `jsonwebtoken`.  The token's lifespan was shortened to 15 minutes.  It also simplified the email template and error handling.  The `forgotPassword` function now returns a more concise success message, and the  `resetPassword`  function now extracts the token from the request parameters (`req.params`) instead of the request body (`req.body`).  The code was also restructured to use `exports` for exporting functions.  Error handling was also improved, with more specific error messages and including the error object in the response for debugging purposes in the `forgotPassword` function.  The bcrypt library was changed from `require("bcrypt")` to `require("bcryptjs")`.  Environment variables were shortened (e.g., `EMAIL_USER` instead of `EMAIL_USERNAME`).  The code uses a `BASE_URL` environment variable for constructing the reset link.

The log shows development of password reset functionality in a Node.js backend application.

Initially,  `reset.js` (1:04:05 AM) and `resetPassword.js` (1:04:41 AM) were created to handle password reset requests, using JWT for token generation and nodemailer for email delivery.  The `.env` file was updated multiple times (1:05:04 AM, 1:05:37 AM, 1:16:45 AM, 1:16:53 AM) to add environment variables like `FRONTEND_URL`, `EMAIL_USER`, and `EMAIL_PASS`.  Note that these values are sensitive and were redacted for security reasons.

`app.js` underwent several changes.  Around 1:07:57 AM and 1:08:39 AM, it was updated to include the new password reset routes, with the route being adjusted to `/api/v1/auth` by 1:09:01 AM.

There was a brief period (1:37:25 AM, 1:38:06 AM)  where the `reset.js` file had a pathing error in the `require` statement that was quickly corrected.

Finally, the `User` model in `User.js` was modified (1:42:27 AM, 1:42:41 AM, 1:43:20 AM) to include `token` and `tokenExpires` fields, and a pre-save middleware was added to hash passwords using bcrypt before saving to the database.  This indicates improvements in user security and a more robust password reset process.  The addition of `tokenExpires` suggests enhancements to token management.

The log shows development of authentication features in a React frontend application.

**`ForgotPassword.jsx`**:  This component, first appearing at 2:00:32 AM, handles the forgot password functionality.  It allows users to input their email address to receive a password reset link.  A later update at 2:30:16 AM removed the display of the message returned from the API.


**`router.jsx`**: This file, managing the application routes, underwent multiple changes. At 2:00:53 AM, the initial routes were defined, including paths for `/trade`, `/support`, `/history`, `/profile`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/plans`, `/buy`, and `/admin`. At 2:01:52 AM, a route for password reset (`/reset-password`) was added.  Finally, at 2:08:33 AM, the `/reset-password` route was changed to `/forgot-password`  to align with the `ForgotPassword` component.


**`LoginForm.jsx`**: This component, first appearing at 2:03:53 AM, handles user login.  It uses axios to make a POST request to the backend for authentication.  The component was modified multiple times between 2:03:53 AM and 2:09:31 AM.  These changes involved adding and refining the UI element for the "Forgot Password?" functionality,  making the button functional by adding a `handleForgotPassword` function and navigating the user to the `/forgot-password` route.  The styling of the UI elements was also slightly adjusted in these repeated updates.  The final version of `LoginForm.jsx` (2:09:31 AM) includes a "Forgot Password?" button that directs users to the correct route.

In summary, the code changes reflect the iterative development of authentication features, including login, signup, and password reset. The `LoginForm` component received the most updates as the team likely worked on implementing and refining the "Forgot Password" functionality.  A consistent pattern is the use of `axios` for API calls and  `react-router-dom` for navigation.  The styling consistently uses Tailwind CSS classes.
