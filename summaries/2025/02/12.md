# Activity Summary for 2/12/2025

## 12:41:53 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `Billing.jsx` and `CustomerList.jsx` components, with `Reports.jsx` also undergoing changes.  The most significant changes occurred on February 11th, 2025, with a series of rapid modifications to `Billing.jsx` between 9:50 AM and 9:51 AM.  These changes involved the initial creation of a `BillingDashboard` component, which displays billing information including total customers, today's bill, pending bills, and a table of customer invoices.  A later revision on the same day (7:47 PM) seems to have restored an earlier version of the component without the table and pagination.


On February 12th, 2025, further revisions to `Billing.jsx` (around 10:00 AM) focused on replacing the pagination buttons with SVG icons for "Previous" and "Next" navigation.  The `CustomerList.jsx` component received an update on February 12th, 2025, at 9:58 AM; however, the log doesn't provide details about the nature of these changes. The `Reports.jsx` component was updated twice on February 11th, 2025, around 7:49 PM. The changes to this component involve the addition of date input fields for filtering reports.


A recurring element in the code is the use of `new Array(8).fill({})` to create sample data for components.  This suggests that the sample data is placeholder data likely used for development and testing. The consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is also apparent throughout the code snippets.
