# Activity Summary for 2/2/2025

## 12:09:48 AM
The log shows development of a React admin panel.  Significant changes occurred between 11:09 PM and 11:20 PM on February 1st, 2025, and then again around midnight on February 2nd, 2025.

`Setting.jsx` underwent the most revisions. Initially, it used a component-based approach for dropdowns and file uploads (`FormSelect`, `DropFiles`),  but these imports were later commented out and replaced with native `<Form.Select>` and `<Form.Control type="file">` elements. This suggests a simplification of the component's dependencies. The styling also changed between versions, becoming more concise and using more straightforward React Bootstrap components.  A state variable to handle file selection (`selectedFile`) was added in one commit, indicating the addition of file upload functionality.  Finally, one commit left the file completely empty, likely an accidental deletion or temporary state.


`App.jsx` shows routing changes. Initially, the `/setting` route pointed to `Setting.jsx`, but this was later changed to `SettingsPage.jsx`, reflecting a renaming or refactor of the settings component.  A route for `/sidebar` was added, showing the addition of a sidebar component.


`OtpVerification.jsx` shows a complete rework of the UI/UX, switching from a simple layout to one with more styling and improved visual appeal.  The functional aspect (handling OTP verification using `axios` to a backend) remained unchanged.

`SettingsPage.jsx` introduces a new settings page with a more advanced layout, including sections for avatar, basic information, password change, and account deletion. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and `lucide-react` for icons.


`SideBar.jsx` also shows UI/UX rework, along with changing the way the sidebar's state is managed. It shows changes from commented code to functional component and again back to functional component with changes in the way the state was managed.


`AdminPanel.jsx` shows the initial design of the main admin panel dashboard.


In summary, the codebase underwent significant UI/UX improvements between February 1st and 2nd, while functionality (like OTP verification and logout) was implemented earlier.  The changes show a pattern of iterative design and refactorings to improve both the look and feel and dependency management of the application.


## 12:37:41 AM
The log shows a single update to `SignupForm.jsx` at 2/1/2025, 11:37:59 PM.  This component is a React signup form. The update modifies the form's structure, removing separate fields for first and last name and replacing them with a single "Full Name" field. The form now submits data to an endpoint  `${import.meta.env.VITE_APP_BASE_URL}user/signup` using `axios`. Upon successful submission, it stores a token in local storage and redirects to the root path (`/`). Error handling is implemented to display server-side errors or a generic error message. The form includes visual elements styled using Tailwind CSS, showing loading state and providing a link to navigate to the login page.  The component uses React's `useState` hook for managing form data, loading state and error messages, and `useNavigate` for navigation.
