# Activity Summary for 2/24/2025

## 11:46:40 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `CustomerList.jsx` between 10:57 AM and 11:08 AM on February 24, 2025, primarily focused on refining the UI of a customer order form and list.  The modal containing the order form underwent several changes, with additions of `overflow-y-auto` and `max-h` to control scrolling and height.  The `handleDeleteItem` function was implemented to remove items from the order, and the Edit button was removed from the item list.


A separate file, `LaundaryCategoryList.jsx`, was edited at 11:06 AM on the same day. This component handles the creation and management of laundry categories and subcategories, using API calls (`axios`) to interact with a backend. The UI involves a modal for adding/editing categories and uses `heroicons` for icons.  The component includes functionality to add, remove, and edit subcategories within a category.


Finally, `App.jsx` was updated at 11:14 AM, showing the routing configuration for the application.  It defines routes for various components, including `CustomerList`, `LaundaryCategoryList`,  `StationList`, and authentication pages (`SignupPage`, `LoginPage`, `OTPVerificationPage`).  The `App` component renders a layout including a `Navbar` and `Sidebar` for most routes, except for the authentication pages.  `Sidebar.jsx` was modified at 11:11 AM and 11:11:35 AM. These modifications removed the Help section and involved minor styling adjustments.  `StationList.jsx` was modified multiple times between 11:13 AM and 11:18 AM.  The most significant change was in the UI elements and renaming a few elements, while still using API calls for backend interaction.  The changes consistently use axios for API calls to endpoints such as `/api/orders/orders` and `/api/laundry/categories`.  The consistent use of React components, styling, and error handling (`try...catch`) is observed throughout the code.
