# Activity Summary for 2/24/2025

## 11:46:40 AM
The log shows multiple edits to `CustomerList.jsx` between 10:57 AM and 11:08 AM on February 24, 2025, primarily focused on refining the UI of a customer order form and list.  The modal containing the order form underwent several changes, with additions of `overflow-y-auto` and `max-h` to control scrolling and height.  The `handleDeleteItem` function was implemented to remove items from the order, and the Edit button was removed from the item list.


A separate file, `LaundaryCategoryList.jsx`, was edited at 11:06 AM on the same day. This component handles the creation and management of laundry categories and subcategories, using API calls (`axios`) to interact with a backend. The UI involves a modal for adding/editing categories and uses `heroicons` for icons.  The component includes functionality to add, remove, and edit subcategories within a category.


Finally, `App.jsx` was updated at 11:14 AM, showing the routing configuration for the application.  It defines routes for various components, including `CustomerList`, `LaundaryCategoryList`,  `StationList`, and authentication pages (`SignupPage`, `LoginPage`, `OTPVerificationPage`).  The `App` component renders a layout including a `Navbar` and `Sidebar` for most routes, except for the authentication pages.  `Sidebar.jsx` was modified at 11:11 AM and 11:11:35 AM. These modifications removed the Help section and involved minor styling adjustments.  `StationList.jsx` was modified multiple times between 11:13 AM and 11:18 AM.  The most significant change was in the UI elements and renaming a few elements, while still using API calls for backend interaction.  The changes consistently use axios for API calls to endpoints such as `/api/orders/orders` and `/api/laundry/categories`.  The consistent use of React components, styling, and error handling (`try...catch`) is observed throughout the code.


## 4:02:17 PM
The log shows frequent modifications to the `.env` file between 3:04 PM and 3:54 PM on February 24, 2025, primarily focusing on the `DATABASE_URL` variable.  The changes involved adjustments to the database username and password, experimenting with different formats (e.g., using `%40` for `@`).  The final `DATABASE_URL` settled on  `"mysql://root:Govind%40123@localhost:3306/refer_and_earn"`.  The `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` was also updated at 3:18 PM from a placeholder to `fiwaurulzegeeidd`.

The `validators.js` file (middleware) underwent no functional changes, only its timestamps were updated alongside some of the `.env` file changes.

At 3:55 PM, the backend server (`server.js`) was updated. This file uses environment variables loaded via `dotenv.config()`, including `FRONTEND_URL` and implicitly `PORT` and `DATABASE_URL` (for database connection).  The addition of `cors` middleware is notable, enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) from the frontend URL defined in the `.env` file.  A database connection test function was added as well.

Lastly, at 3:58 PM, frontend component files (`ReferralModal.tsx` and `Header.tsx`) were added to the log, indicating work on the frontend user interface for a referral system.  `ReferralModal.tsx` shows a React component for a modal form to submit referral information, while `Header.tsx` is a simple header component for the application.
