The log shows development of a laundry management frontend application.

A simple loading indicator (`Loader.jsx`) was created, undergoing multiple iterations in styling between 11:02 AM and 11:05 AM, changing the border color and adding a background color before settling on a blueish color (`#5A6ACF`).

Finally, there were several changes to the `.env` file between 11:11 AM and 11:12 AM, switching the `VITE_BASE_URL` from a production URL (`https://laundary-management-backend.onrender.com/`) to a local development URL (`http://localhost:5000/`).
