# Activity Summary for 2/19/2025

## 10:57:46 AM
The log shows updates to two React component files: `Navbar.jsx` and `Sidebar.jsx`, both within a laundry management frontend application.  No changes were made to the content of either file between the first and second timestamps for `Navbar.jsx`.

**Navbar.jsx:**

* **2/19/2025, 10:24:27 AM and 2/19/2025, 10:24:47 AM:** The component renders a navigation bar with a search input field using `MagnifyingGlassIcon`, a "Create Laundry" button employing `PlusIcon`, and other SVG icons.  The code remains unchanged between these timestamps.  The navbar is styled using Tailwind CSS classes.

**Sidebar.jsx:**

* **2/19/2025, 10:28:16 AM:** This component displays a sidebar with navigation links for various sections of the laundry management application (Dashboard, Customer List, Laundry Category, etc.), utilizing `react-router-dom` for navigation and `@heroicons/react/24/outline` for icons.  A logout functionality is implemented, using `localStorage` to remove the token and redirecting to the login page.  The sidebar includes a mobile menu toggle using `Bars3Icon` and `XMarkIcon`.  The component uses `react-toastify` for displaying success and error messages during logout.  The sidebar is also styled with Tailwind CSS and has conditional rendering based on `isSidebarOpen` state to handle mobile responsiveness.
