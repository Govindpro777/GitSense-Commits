# Activity Summary for 2/15/2025

## 7:37:01 PM
The primary changes revolve around the frontend structure of a laundry management application and its authentication system.

**App.jsx (2/15/2025, 6:48:18 PM):** This file defines the main application routing.  It sets up routes for various components, including a dashboard, customer list, employee list, billing, reports, and forms for creating new entries (employees, inventory, laundry, supplies, and customers).  The routes are divided into those that include a Navbar and Sidebar and those that do not (Signup, Login and OTP verification).

**Sidebar.jsx (Multiple Revisions, 2/15/2025, 6:54:52 PM - 6:55:40 PM):** This component was modified several times within a short period. The changes primarily focused on minor refinements to the styling and layout of the sidebar.  One significant change involves making the sidebar scrollable using `overflow-auto` instead of `overflow-y-auto`.  The overall structure and functionality of the sidebar remained consistent;  it provides navigation links to the routes defined in `App.jsx` and a logout function that removes the token from local storage and redirects to the login page.


**Login.jsx (2/15/2025, 7:28:35 PM):**  This component implements a login form using `axios` to send login credentials to the backend. It utilizes the `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` environment variable to dynamically set the API base URL.

**OTPVerification.jsx (2 revisions, 2/15/2025, 7:29:21 PM - 7:30:00 PM):** This component handles OTP verification after signup.  It receives the user's email from the previous page using `useLocation` and makes a POST request to the backend to verify the OTP.  Similar to `Login.jsx`, it uses `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL`.  A correction was made to include the base URL in the API endpoint.

**Signup.jsx (Multiple Revisions, 2/15/2025, 7:29:27 PM - 7:31:03 PM):** This component implements a signup form. It uses `axios` to make a POST request to the backend's signup endpoint.  It also redirects to the OTP verification page after successful signup, passing the email via `useLocation`. Several revisions adjusted the API endpoint to use `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` and added a console log to check its value.

**.env (2 Revisions, 2/15/2025, 7:26:25 PM - 7:26:41 PM):** The `.env` file was updated to set the `VITE_BASE_URL` environment variable, pointing to a backend API deployed on Render.

**.gitignore (2/15/2025, 7:34:32 PM):**  This file was updated to explicitly ignore the `.env` file, ensuring that sensitive information is not committed to the repository.


A common pattern across the authentication components (`Login.jsx`, `OTPVerification.jsx`, and `Signup.jsx`) is the use of `axios` for making API requests, consistent styling, and the use of environment variables for managing the API base URL.  The changes show a clear progression towards a functional authentication flow and integrating with a remote backend.


## 10:02:36 PM
The log shows changes made to the `authController.js` file within a  Laundary management backend project.  The file contains code for user authentication, including signup, OTP verification, and login functionality.

`authController.js` underwent several revisions between 7:00:13 PM and 7:00:36 PM on February 15, 2025.  The changes appear minor and  likely involved debugging or code cleanup, as the core functionality (signup, OTP verification, and login using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token generation) remained consistent across all revisions.  Specifically, the only visible difference is the removal of `console.log(req.body)` from the `signup` and `login` functions between the first and subsequent versions.
