# Activity Summary for 2/18/2025

## 11:24:47 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to two files, `CustomerList.jsx` and `Navbar.jsx`, within a short time frame on February 18th, 2025.

**`CustomerList.jsx`**: This file underwent several revisions, all at approximately the same time (between 10:56 AM and 11:04 AM).  The content remained largely unchanged;  the core component appears to display a list of customers with information like date, name, amount, number of pieces, invoice ID, and status.  The changes seem focused on minor adjustments to the rendered UI rather than significant functional changes. No specific changes are discernible from the identical code snippets.

**`Navbar.jsx`**: This file was also heavily revised between 11:04 AM and 11:22 AM. The significant changes involved simplifying the UI. Initially, the code contained commented-out sections,  and several SVG elements within buttons.  The final version removed commented-out code, simplifying the structure and removing redundant buttons. The most significant changes included  the removal of unnecessary SVG elements and the adjustment of the "Create Laundary" button's styling and placement. The button's `px-4 py-2` padding was changed to `px-4 py-2.5` and the `lg:ml-[200px]` margin was changed to  `ml-[200px]`.  A commented-out notification/calendar section was also removed.  The changes suggest a refactoring to improve the Navbar's design.
