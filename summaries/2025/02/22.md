# Activity Summary for 2/22/2025

## 2:25:22 PM
The log shows modifications to `orderController.js` on February 22nd, 2025 at 1:51:05 PM.  The changes implement two primary functionalities: order creation and order retrieval.  The `createOrder` function uses a helper function `getNextOrderId` to generate a unique ID for each new order before saving it to the database using the `Order` model.  The `getOrders` function retrieves and returns all orders from the database.  Both functions include basic error handling using try-catch blocks, returning appropriate status codes (201 for creation success, 200 for retrieval success, and 500 for errors).  The code utilizes console logs for debugging purposes, logging the request body, generated order ID, and the new order object itself.
