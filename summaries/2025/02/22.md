# Activity Summary for 2/22/2025

## 2:25:22 PM
The log shows modifications to `orderController.js` on February 22nd, 2025 at 1:51:05 PM.  The changes implement two primary functionalities: order creation and order retrieval.  The `createOrder` function uses a helper function `getNextOrderId` to generate a unique ID for each new order before saving it to the database using the `Order` model.  The `getOrders` function retrieves and returns all orders from the database.  Both functions include basic error handling using try-catch blocks, returning appropriate status codes (201 for creation success, 200 for retrieval success, and 500 for errors).  The code utilizes console logs for debugging purposes, logging the request body, generated order ID, and the new order object itself.


## 2:25:25 PM
The log shows three revisions of `CustomerList.jsx` on February 22nd, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the order creation process and user feedback.

The first revision (1:50:46 PM) establishes the core component, fetching orders and categories from a backend API using `axios`. It includes a form for adding new orders with features to select laundry categories and subcategories, calculate total amounts, and add items to the order.  The UI uses a modal for order creation and displays a basic customer order list.  Alert boxes are used to provide feedback to the user.


The second revision (1:55:28 PM) improves feedback mechanisms by replacing `alert` calls in the `handleSubmit` function with `react-toastify`'s `toast` for better user experience. The error message in `handleAddItem` was also updated.


The third revision (1:56:35 PM) appears to be identical to the second revision, indicating a possible accidental duplicate or a very minor, undetectable change.

Throughout the revisions, the component consistently interacts with a backend API located at the URL stored in `BASE_URL` (obtained from environment variables, hence excluded from the summary) for fetching order data, categories, subcategories, and for creating new orders. The code uses functional components, hooks, and several external libraries including `axios`, `react-toastify`, `react-datepicker`, and Heroicons and react-icons for UI elements.  No structural changes are observed across the three revisions; only the feedback mechanisms and possibly a minor error message in `handleAddItem` were modified.
