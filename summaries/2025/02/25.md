# Activity Summary for 2/25/2025

## 12:03:42 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\New folder (3)\frontend\src\components\ReferralModal.tsx` at 7:56:07 PM on February 24, 2025.  This change introduces a React component, `ReferralModal`, which is a form for submitting referral information.  The component includes input fields for referrer and referee names and emails, course selection, and form validation.  Upon submission, it sends a POST request to `https://accredian-backend-task-tfp2.onrender.com/api/referrals`.  Error handling is included for both network errors and form validation failures. The UI uses a modal pattern and styling consistent with Tailwind CSS.  The form validates that all fields are filled and that email addresses are correctly formatted.


## 1:06:36 AM
The log shows two updates to `ReferralModal.tsx` within a minute of each other (12:12:23 AM and 12:12:34 AM).  The only difference between these two versions is the API endpoint used in the `handleSubmit` function. The initial version used just `'api/referrals'`, while the second version uses `'http://localhost:4000/api/referrals'`, explicitly specifying the port and protocol. This suggests a change in how the frontend interacts with the backend.  `ReferralModal.tsx` itself is a React component implementing a referral form with input validation for referrer and referee names and emails, and a course selection. The form data is submitted to an API endpoint for processing.


There are also two entries showing the contents of a `.env` file.  No summary for this file is given as requested.


## 10:33:19 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `StationList.jsx` component between 9:57 AM and 9:58 AM on February 25th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve refactoring the component's code.  There's a recurring pattern of commented-out code sections throughout the log entries.  The commented code represents different versions or attempts at implementing the `StationList` component, showcasing an iterative development process.  Initially, the code appears to have included features such as a date picker and more complex subcategory management.  Later revisions simplify the component, focusing on a more basic form for adding stations with fields for station name, contact, email, password, and address. The final version removes the date picker,  the more complex subcategory logic and retains a simplified modal for adding stations, using `PlusIcon`, `TrashIcon`, and `FaTimes` icons for UI elements.  The `BASE_URL` variable consistently utilizes `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL`, indicating reliance on environment variables for API endpoints.  All revisions show the use of React, axios, and several icon libraries.  The rapid succession of changes suggests a period of active development and debugging of the component.


## 10:38:36 AM
The log shows two entries for `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Laundary_management-backend\models\User.js`.  Both entries at 10:13:55 AM and 10:21:30 AM on February 25th, 2025, contain identical code defining a Mongoose schema for a `User` model.  This schema includes fields for `fullName`, `email`, `password`, OTP (One-Time Password) related fields (`otp` and `otpExpires`), and `isVerified`.  No actual changes were made to the User.js file during this period, despite two separate log entries.  This suggests a possible logging redundancy.


## 2:01:46 PM
The log shows modifications to environment variables and a referral route file.

Between 1:18 PM and 1:26 PM, the `.env` file underwent several changes related to the database URL.  Initially, it included both a local and a remote database connection string. The remote connection string was then modified, changing the username portion from `root` to `sql12764574`. Finally, the local connection string was commented out leaving only the remote database as the active connection. The Gmail credentials remained unchanged.


The `referralRoutes.js` file, related to referral functionality, shows no changes in its code content. It was accessed/modified multiple times between 1:27 PM and 1:31 PM. This suggests that  while the file was likely open and possibly undergoing testing or other operations during this time, no actual code alterations were committed.


## 3:01:48 PM
The log shows changes to a React frontend component (`ReferralModal.tsx`) and a Node.js backend controller (`referralController.js`) for a referral system, both updated at approximately 2:43 PM on February 25th, 2025.

**`ReferralModal.tsx` (Frontend):** This component implements a modal form allowing users to submit referral information.  The form includes input fields for referrer and referee names and emails, along with a course selection dropdown.  Input validation is performed client-side, checking for required fields and valid email formats. Upon successful validation, a POST request is sent to `http://localhost:4000/api/referrals`.  Error handling is included to manage failed submissions and network errors. The UI uses a clean, modern styling with purple accents.

**`referralController.js` (Backend):** This controller handles the creation of referrals. It receives referral data from the frontend, inserts it into a database table named `referrals`, and sends a confirmation email to the referee using a configured email transporter. The email includes the referrer's name, the referee's name, and the referred course.  Error handling is implemented to catch database and email sending errors.  The code uses a connection pool (`pool`) for database interaction.

The updates suggest a coordinated effort to implement a complete referral feature, encompassing both user interface and backend processing with email notification.  The close timestamps indicate these changes were made as part of a single development cycle.
