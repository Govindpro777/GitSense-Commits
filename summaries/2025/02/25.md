# Activity Summary for 2/25/2025

## 12:03:42 AM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\New folder (3)\frontend\src\components\ReferralModal.tsx` at 7:56:07 PM on February 24, 2025.  This change introduces a React component, `ReferralModal`, which is a form for submitting referral information.  The component includes input fields for referrer and referee names and emails, course selection, and form validation.  Upon submission, it sends a POST request to `https://accredian-backend-task-tfp2.onrender.com/api/referrals`.  Error handling is included for both network errors and form validation failures. The UI uses a modal pattern and styling consistent with Tailwind CSS.  The form validates that all fields are filled and that email addresses are correctly formatted.


## 1:06:36 AM
The log shows two updates to `ReferralModal.tsx` within a minute of each other (12:12:23 AM and 12:12:34 AM).  The only difference between these two versions is the API endpoint used in the `handleSubmit` function. The initial version used just `'api/referrals'`, while the second version uses `'http://localhost:4000/api/referrals'`, explicitly specifying the port and protocol. This suggests a change in how the frontend interacts with the backend.  `ReferralModal.tsx` itself is a React component implementing a referral form with input validation for referrer and referee names and emails, and a course selection. The form data is submitted to an API endpoint for processing.


There are also two entries showing the contents of a `.env` file.  No summary for this file is given as requested.
