The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\New folder (3)\frontend\src\components\ReferralModal.tsx` at 7:56:07 PM on February 24, 2025.  This change introduces a React component, `ReferralModal`, which is a form for submitting referral information.  The component includes input fields for referrer and referee names and emails, course selection, and form validation.  Upon submission, it sends a POST request to `https://accredian-backend-task-tfp2.onrender.com/api/referrals`.  Error handling is included for both network errors and form validation failures. The UI uses a modal pattern and styling consistent with Tailwind CSS.  The form validates that all fields are filled and that email addresses are correctly formatted.
