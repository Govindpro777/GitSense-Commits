# Activity Summary for 3/30/2025

## 11:25:24 AM
The log shows a series of frontend and backend code changes for a Metal CRM application between 10:25 AM and 11:19 AM on March 30, 2025.  The updates primarily focus on the `Orders`, `CreateNewOrder`, `EditOrder`, and `UserManagement` pages, along with their supporting components and backend controllers.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\Orders.jsx`:** This file underwent multiple revisions.  Early versions show a functional component for displaying orders with features like searching, filtering by status, and actions (view, edit, delete).  Later versions transitioned to a more modern, table-based UI using Tailwind CSS for styling, and included image preview functionality using a new `ImagePreviewModal` component.  A significant change involved replacing the card-based order display with a table-based structure and the addition of image preview functionality, improving the UIâ€™s organization and information density.  The `deleteOrder` function now optimistically updates the UI before confirming the deletion with the backend.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\CreateNewOrder.jsx`:** This component was updated to utilize custom hooks (`useCustomers`, `useGraphicsUsers`) for improved data fetching and filtering of customers and assigned users. The UI was enhanced with auto-suggest dropdowns for customer and user selection, improving usability.  The final revision includes improved handling of image uploads.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\useCustomer.jsx` and `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\useGraphicsUser.jsx`:** These custom hooks were added to manage customer and graphic user data, respectively. They handle fetching, filtering, and clearing filtered lists.  These hooks significantly clean up the code in `CreateNewOrder` and `EditOrder` by centralizing data handling.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\ImagePreviewModal.jsx`:** This component was added to handle image previews.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\App.jsx`:** This file shows the routing configuration for the application, including the addition of a sidebar component (`Sidebar2`) and updated routes to reflect the new components introduced.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\EditOrder.jsx`:** This component manages order updates and incorporates a user suggestion box similar to the `CreateNewOrder` component.  The  user interface was improved, using a modal with form elements for input and updates.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\models\order.model.js`:** The `created` field's data type changed from `Date` to `String`, storing the date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\controller\order.controller.js`:** This controller handles order-related API requests. Significant changes include added functionality for updating order status in `updateOrder` and the addition of a createOrder function to handle order creation.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\models\user.models.js`:**  A `created` field was added to the User model, storing the creation date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\controller\user.controller.js`:** This controller was updated to handle user account creation and authorization.  The update involved adding the `created` field to the user model.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\UserManagement.jsx`:** This page was improved with a filter and search functionality, along with visual enhancements using Tailwind CSS.  The date display was also improved to show only the date part.


Overall, the changes reflect a significant improvement in both the frontend user interface and the backend API functionality, aiming for better user experience and more robust data handling.  A recurring theme is the consistent use of React, axios, and Tailwind CSS across the codebase. The changes were made in a relatively short time span, suggesting focused development sprints.


## 2:39:24 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `Offer.tsx` and `Experts.tsx`, and  `how_works.tsx` between 12:26 PM and 2:38 PM on March 30, 2025.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Exper-Buddy\components\Offer.tsx`**:  This file underwent extensive styling adjustments.  Changes primarily focused on the positioning (`left`, `top`) and dimensions (`w`, `h`) of images (specifically `crown` and `country`) within the UI.  There were also minor modifications to padding and class names in the input field and its container between 12:31 PM and 12:36 PM.  The most significant change was replacing a placeholder image with the `country` image at 12:26:56 PM.  The rest of the changes between 12:26 PM and 12:36 PM involved minor adjustments to styling, with no substantial functional changes. After 12:36 PM, the changes only affect the styling of the `crown` image.

**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Exper-Buddy\components\Experts.tsx`**: This file was initially commented out but was uncommented and significantly revised at 2:09:39 PM. The update involved replacing inline SVG icons with imported images (`Img1`, `Img2`, `Img3`) and restructuring the layout of images in the right section.  The code also  updated the styling and layout of the component and replaced a `Calendar` icon with a custom SVG icon for the deadline input.  The feature section was also completely restyled.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Exper-Buddy\components\how_works.tsx`**: This file underwent several revisions concerning the styling and positioning of the crown image and the `Step` numbering within the component.  The most notable changes happen between 2:14 PM and 2:38 PM, primarily focusing on visual improvements, and  specifically the styling of the Step numbers (changing border size and adding rounded corners).  There was no changes to the functionality of the component.

**Recurring Patterns**:  A common theme across all files is the use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling,  the frequent use of `Image` components from `next/image`, and the consistent use of the `crown` image for decorative purposes.  The frequent changes in `Offer.tsx` suggest iterative UI refinements.
