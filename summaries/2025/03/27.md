# Activity Summary for 3/27/2025

## 6:35:28 PM
The log shows significant frontend and backend development on a Metal CRM application between 5:37 PM and 6:31 PM on March 27, 2025.

**Frontend Changes:**

* **`Sidebar.jsx` (5:37 PM):** This component was updated to implement a dynamic sidebar based on user role (`SuperAdmin`, `Admin`, `Graphics`, `Display`, `Accounts`).  The sidebar displays different menu items depending on the user's role retrieved from local storage. A logout functionality is also implemented.

* **`EditOrder.jsx` (5:39 PM, 5:39:55 PM):** This page underwent two revisions.  The first version used a hardcoded URL. The second, and final, version replaced the hardcoded URL with a dynamic URL from the environment variable `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL`, improving maintainability and deployment flexibility. The page allows for editing order details (customer name, dimensions, status, assignedTo) and updating them via API calls.

* **`CreateNewOrder.jsx` (5:40 PM, 5:42 PM, 6:09 PM, 6:09:46 PM, 6:10 PM, 6:10:23 PM, 6:14 PM, 6:15 PM):** This component, responsible for creating new orders, saw multiple revisions. Early versions had hardcoded API URLs; later versions were updated to use `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` for better flexibility. The most significant updates focused on error handling with the addition of `react-hot-toast` for displaying user-friendly messages, improved loading state management with the `Loader` component, and input validation.  It now also includes image uploading functionality.  The final version included thorough error handling using `react-hot-toast` for a better user experience.

* **`Orders.jsx` (5:41 PM, 6:17 PM, 6:18 PM):** This page displays a list of orders. It was updated to fetch orders from the backend, implement search and filtering functionality by customer name, order ID, and status.  The loading state and error handling were improved significantly using `react-hot-toast`  in the final version for better user experience. A delete functionality was added which now performs optimistic updates and error handling via toast messages.


* **`App.jsx` (5:43 PM, 5:53 PM):** The main application routing component. It was updated to include the new `EditOrder` component in the routing configuration. No other significant changes.

* **`Dashboard.jsx` (5:43 PM):**  A dashboard displaying summary statistics and recent orders. No significant changes to functionality in this update.

* **`Loader.jsx` (5:48 PM - 5:50 PM):** This component, a simple loading indicator, underwent multiple seemingly redundant updates, but there are no actual code changes in these edits.

* **`Login.jsx` (5:52 PM, 5:54 PM, 5:54:50 PM):** The login component was updated to improve user interface, add loading indicator (`Loader` component) during authentication, and implement better error handling, with the addition of a loading state and error messages. The final version incorporates a visually appealing loading spinner integrated within the login button itself.

* **`Customers.jsx` (6:08 PM, 6:09 PM, 6:20 PM, 6:20:30 PM):** This component manages customer data. It features fetching, creating, updating, and deleting customers through API calls. Multiple revisions focused on robust error handling and improved user feedback using `react-hot-toast` for a better user experience. Loading indicators are incorporated for better feedback while asynchronous operations are underway.



**Backend Changes:**

* **`order.controller.js` (5:38 PM, 6:01 PM, 6:06 PM):** The order controller was updated to handle creating, assigning, fetching, updating, and deleting orders.  Image uploading using Cloudinary was integrated, with improved error handling and sequential order ID generation.  The final version ensures that images are correctly saved with proper error handling and response.

* **`cloudinary.js` (6:29 PM, 6:30 PM, 6:31 PM):** The Cloudinary configuration file underwent several revisions. The initial version had commented-out code. The final version configures Cloudinary using environment variables for cloud name, API key, and API secret, setting up the storage for images uploaded via the backend. The folder path for uploaded files is specified here.


**Recurring Elements:**

A significant pattern is the consistent use of `react-hot-toast` for improved user feedback and error handling across multiple components, and the use of environment variables for API URLs and Cloudinary configuration.  The consistent use of `async/await` for asynchronous operations is also observed.  There is also a substantial focus on error handling and user experience improvements through toast messages and loading indicators.
