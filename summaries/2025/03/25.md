# Activity Summary for 3/25/2025

## 11:21:05 AM
The `UserManagement.jsx` component was updated twice on March 25th, 2025.  The first update at 9:47:24 AM shows a React component for managing users.  It fetches user data via an API call using Axios,  includes functionality to add new users, and displays a list of existing users with their details (name, email, account type, creation timestamp).  The user list was initially commented out. The second update at 9:59:26 AM uncommented the user list display section, making the user list dynamically rendered based on fetched data.  Both versions included functionality for adding users via a modal, and both used `lucide-react` icons. The key change between the two updates was the un-commenting of the section displaying the fetched user data, making the component fully functional.  The code consistently uses Axios for API interactions, storing the authentication token in local storage, and leveraging React's state management hooks.
