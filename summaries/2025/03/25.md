# Activity Summary for 3/25/2025

## 11:21:05 AM
The `UserManagement.jsx` component was updated twice on March 25th, 2025.  The first update at 9:47:24 AM shows a React component for managing users.  It fetches user data via an API call using Axios,  includes functionality to add new users, and displays a list of existing users with their details (name, email, account type, creation timestamp).  The user list was initially commented out. The second update at 9:59:26 AM uncommented the user list display section, making the user list dynamically rendered based on fetched data.  Both versions included functionality for adding users via a modal, and both used `lucide-react` icons. The key change between the two updates was the un-commenting of the section displaying the fetched user data, making the component fully functional.  The code consistently uses Axios for API interactions, storing the authentication token in local storage, and leveraging React's state management hooks.

The log shows code changes made on March 25th, 2025, to a React application.  The primary changes involve the creation or significant update of a login component.

`App.jsx` (12:42:21 PM): This file contains the main application routing.  The code shows a basic structure with a `<Login>` component for the `/login` route.  A commented-out section suggests a planned, more extensive route structure including components like `Dashboard`, `PipelinesPage`, etc. This indicates the application is under development and the initial login functionality has been implemented first.

`Login.jsx` (12:42:38 PM): This file defines the login component (`HealthPlixLoginPage`).  It's a visually rich component featuring a visually appealing login form, marketing-style information about HealthPlix, and placeholder images.  The login form handles email and password input, along with a "Remember Me" functionality and links for password recovery and signup.  The time difference between the updates to `App.jsx` and `Login.jsx` suggests that the Login component was developed immediately after setting up the basic routing.  The styling heavily uses Tailwind CSS.
