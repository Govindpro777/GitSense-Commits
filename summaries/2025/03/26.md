# Activity Summary for 3/26/2025

## 5:44:23 AM
The log shows initial development of a React application.  The earliest change (1:59:07 AM) involves creating a basic `App.jsx` component, which simply renders a "app" div.  Next, `main.jsx` (2:12:05 AM) is updated to render this `App` component, demonstrating the application's basic structure and utilizing `react-dom`.  It also includes logging of the environment variable `NODE_ENV` and uses `serviceWorker.unregister()`. Finally, the `vite.config.js` file (2:14:29 AM) is modified to include a React plugin and an alias for the `src` directory, which is a common practice to improve import statements.  The `vite.config.js` update suggests a move towards using Vite as the build tool. The overall pattern shows a progression from a minimal setup to a more structured project.
