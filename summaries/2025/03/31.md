# Activity Summary for 3/31/2025

## 10:39:46 AM
The log shows several code changes across two files (`user.models.js` and `order.controller.js`) and one file `Sidebar.jsx` within a Metal CRM application.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\models\user.models.js` (3/31/2025, 9:45:02 AM):** This file defines a Mongoose schema for users.  The schema includes fields for `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `password`, `accountType` (with an enum specifying different user roles), `isActive`, and a `created` timestamp.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\controller\order.controller.js` (Multiple Updates):**  This file contains the controllers for order management. There are multiple revisions of this file over a short period:

* **(3/31/2025, 9:53:45 AM):** Initial commit with functions for creating, assigning, retrieving, updating, deleting, and approving orders. The `createOrder` function includes commented-out cloudinary image upload functionality.  Order IDs are sequentially generated.  The code populates related fields (customer, assignedTo, createdBy) using `.populate()`.

* **(3/31/2025, 9:54:48 AM):**  A change in the `createOrder` function.  When assigning an order (`assignedTo` field), the assigned user's `isActive` field is set to `true`. This implies a user activation mechanism upon order assignment.

* **(3/31/2025, 9:58:04 AM):** The `createOrder` function is further modified to add a check preventing orders from being assigned to users with the `accountType` of "Graphics".  The commented-out code to update the assigned user's `isActive` property is still present.


* **(3/31/2025, 9:58:42 AM):** The commented-out code to update `isActive` is removed from `createOrder`.  This suggests a decision to decouple user activation from order assignment.

* **(3/31/2025, 10:11:40 AM):** This revision is identical to the one at 9:58:42 AM.


The `order.controller.js` file consistently uses Mongoose's `findById`, `findByIdAndUpdate`, and `find` methods for database interactions.  Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks.  The code also shows a potential integration with a cloudinary image storage service (commented-out initially).

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\components\New folder\Sidebar.jsx` (3/31/2025, 10:00:47 AM):** This React component renders a sidebar menu based on the user's `accountType` stored in localStorage.  The menu dynamically adapts to display different options for different user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts). The sidebar includes a logout button.  The menu structure is clearly defined in the `menuItems` object, making it easy to maintain and extend.


## 11:39:43 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `ImageUploader.js` on March 31st, 2025.  The main function, `localFileUpload`, handles local file uploads using `express-fileupload`, `path`, and `fs` modules.  It ensures the input `files` is an array, creates a directory ("files") if it doesn't exist, and uploads each file, assigning a timestamped filename.  The commented-out code suggests that cloudinary integration was previously considered, but it was removed in later commits.

Specific changes across the revisions include:

* **11:31:29 AM:** Initial commit of `localFileUpload`. The upload directory was initially set to `path.join(__dirname, "files")`.
* **11:33:23 AM:** The upload directory path was modified to `path.join(__dirname, "../files")`, changing the relative path to the parent directory.
* **11:39:19 AM:** A minor change in code formatting; backticks were added around `${Date.now()}_${file.name}` for better string interpolation clarity.  The upload directory path reverted back to `path.join(__dirname, "files")`.  No functional changes were made.

The commented-out `uploadImageToCloudinary` function indicates an intention to support cloudinary uploads, possibly abandoned during development.  The consistent use of promises and error handling (`try...catch`) is evident throughout the code.
