# Activity Summary for 3/31/2025

## 10:39:46 AM
The log shows several code changes across two files (`user.models.js` and `order.controller.js`) and one file `Sidebar.jsx` within a Metal CRM application.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\models\user.models.js` (3/31/2025, 9:45:02 AM):** This file defines a Mongoose schema for users.  The schema includes fields for `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `password`, `accountType` (with an enum specifying different user roles), `isActive`, and a `created` timestamp.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\controller\order.controller.js` (Multiple Updates):**  This file contains the controllers for order management. There are multiple revisions of this file over a short period:

* **(3/31/2025, 9:53:45 AM):** Initial commit with functions for creating, assigning, retrieving, updating, deleting, and approving orders. The `createOrder` function includes commented-out cloudinary image upload functionality.  Order IDs are sequentially generated.  The code populates related fields (customer, assignedTo, createdBy) using `.populate()`.

* **(3/31/2025, 9:54:48 AM):**  A change in the `createOrder` function.  When assigning an order (`assignedTo` field), the assigned user's `isActive` field is set to `true`. This implies a user activation mechanism upon order assignment.

* **(3/31/2025, 9:58:04 AM):** The `createOrder` function is further modified to add a check preventing orders from being assigned to users with the `accountType` of "Graphics".  The commented-out code to update the assigned user's `isActive` property is still present.


* **(3/31/2025, 9:58:42 AM):** The commented-out code to update `isActive` is removed from `createOrder`.  This suggests a decision to decouple user activation from order assignment.

* **(3/31/2025, 10:11:40 AM):** This revision is identical to the one at 9:58:42 AM.


The `order.controller.js` file consistently uses Mongoose's `findById`, `findByIdAndUpdate`, and `find` methods for database interactions.  Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks.  The code also shows a potential integration with a cloudinary image storage service (commented-out initially).

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\components\New folder\Sidebar.jsx` (3/31/2025, 10:00:47 AM):** This React component renders a sidebar menu based on the user's `accountType` stored in localStorage.  The menu dynamically adapts to display different options for different user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts). The sidebar includes a logout button.  The menu structure is clearly defined in the `menuItems` object, making it easy to maintain and extend.


## 11:39:43 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `ImageUploader.js` on March 31st, 2025.  The main function, `localFileUpload`, handles local file uploads using `express-fileupload`, `path`, and `fs` modules.  It ensures the input `files` is an array, creates a directory ("files") if it doesn't exist, and uploads each file, assigning a timestamped filename.  The commented-out code suggests that cloudinary integration was previously considered, but it was removed in later commits.

Specific changes across the revisions include:

* **11:31:29 AM:** Initial commit of `localFileUpload`. The upload directory was initially set to `path.join(__dirname, "files")`.
* **11:33:23 AM:** The upload directory path was modified to `path.join(__dirname, "../files")`, changing the relative path to the parent directory.
* **11:39:19 AM:** A minor change in code formatting; backticks were added around `${Date.now()}_${file.name}` for better string interpolation clarity.  The upload directory path reverted back to `path.join(__dirname, "files")`.  No functional changes were made.

The commented-out `uploadImageToCloudinary` function indicates an intention to support cloudinary uploads, possibly abandoned during development.  The consistent use of promises and error handling (`try...catch`) is evident throughout the code.


## 2:43:47 PM
The `graphics.controller.js` file underwent several revisions on March 31st, 2025.  The main focus of the changes was the `createOrder` function.

Initially, the code used `uploadImageToCloudinary` for image uploads. This was later commented out, and  `localFileUpload` was implemented instead.  There were also several intermediate commits where the `localFileUpload` was commented out, indicating potential experimentation or debugging.  The final version correctly handles cases where no images are uploaded by initializing `imageUrls` as an empty array and only calling `localFileUpload` if `files` exist.


Between 2:30:37 PM and 2:33:05 PM, there were multiple iterations to handle file uploads more robustly.  The initial version directly accessed `req.files.images`, which was improved to handle the case where `req.files.images` might be null or undefined using a conditional operator (`req.files && req.files.images ? req.files.images : null`). The commented out cloudinary upload suggests a shift in the image storage strategy.


The other functions (`findAvailableGraphicsUser`, `sendAssignmentNotification`, `calculatePriority`, `calculateEstimatedCompletion`, `getPendingOrders`, `reassignUnassignedOrders`, `getUserAssignedOrders`, and the `process-order` agenda job) remained largely unchanged throughout these revisions.  These functions manage order creation, assignment, and processing workflows, leveraging MongoDB aggregation for user selection and transactional operations using Mongoose sessions to ensure data consistency.  The `process-order` agenda job handles the asynchronous processing of orders.  There is consistent use of error handling with try-catch blocks and transaction management to ensure reliability.


## 2:43:57 PM
The log shows multiple code changes across several files within a Metal CRM application.  The most significant changes relate to order management and image uploading.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\controller\order.controller.js`**:  This file underwent several revisions between 11:40 AM and 12:01 PM.  Initially, the code included commented-out sections suggesting the use of Cloudinary for image uploading.  Subsequent revisions replaced Cloudinary with a `localFileUpload` function.  This suggests a shift in the image storage strategy from a cloud-based solution to local file storage.  The `createOrder`, `assignOrder`, `getOrders`, `getOrderById`, `updateOrder` and `deleteOrder` functions remained largely consistent across these changes, primarily involving bug fixes or minor adjustments. The commented-out sections were entirely removed in the final revision at 12:01 PM.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\controller\graphics.controller.js`**:  This controller, introduced around 11:42 AM, handles order creation and management specifically for the graphics team.   Multiple updates were made between 2:33 PM and 2:37 PM, primarily focusing on robust error handling and improving file upload logic.  The changes ensure that images are only processed and uploaded if files are provided. The `process-order` agenda job was improved to handle potential errors during order processing, reverting the order status to 'New' and adding an error message in case of failure.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\routes\admin.routes.js`**:  Between 11:46 AM and 12:20 PM, this file received several updates to incorporate new routes related to graphics order management. Specifically, routes were added for `/createOrder/:id`, `/pending`, `/reassign`, and `/assigned`, all pointing to the `graphicController` added previously. The `isAdmin` middleware was consistently used to protect these routes.  The `updateOrder` route is also updated from `upload.single('image')` to `updateOrder` alone suggesting a change in image handling approach.  Additionally, the `getUser` middleware import was added and removed in this file over a few consecutive edits.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\UserManagement.jsx`**: This component, updated around 1:46 PM and 1:52 PM, handles user management in the frontend.  The primary change was the addition of an "Add User" modal that allows for user creation.  The UI improvements were made to the overall appearance of the user management page.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\CreateNewOrder.jsx`**: This component, updated between 1:59 PM and 2:37 PM, is responsible for creating new orders.  The major revision involved transitioning from a single-image upload to handling multiple images with previews, improving the user experience. The code was also refactored to handle submission of the form using `fetch` which simplified it slightly.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\EditOrder.jsx`**: This component was updated between 2:15PM and 2:16 PM.  It now handles image uploads and previews for editing orders. This component also switched from `axios` to `fetch` for data retrieval.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\ImagePreviewModal.jsx`**: This component was updated at 2:16PM to handle multiple images, displaying a carousel-style preview rather than a single image.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\index.js`**: This file, updated at 2:29 PM, sets up the backend server. The changes focused on setting up a server for the application. No substantial code changes were made.


In summary, the codebase underwent a significant refactoring concerning image handling, shifting from Cloudinary to local file uploads.  New features related to graphics order management were added.  The frontend components received updates to enhance user experience, particularly in order creation and image handling.  A new super admin controller route was added in the backend.


## 4:43:51 PM
The log shows significant development activity on March 31st, 2025, focused on a Metal CRM backend and frontend.

**Backend Changes:**

* **`order.model.js` (3:51:57 PM, 4:15:42 PM):** This model underwent minor revisions.  The only change between the two timestamps is the removal and re-addition of `required: true`  for `customerName`. The `order` schema defines fields for order details (ID, customer, requirements, dimensions, status, images, assigned/approved/created by users, customer name, and creation timestamp).  The status field includes various stages of order processing.

* **`graphics.controller.js` (4:02:04 PM):** This controller handles order creation and management, specifically for graphics-related tasks. Key functions include:
    * `findAvailableGraphicsUser()`:  Finds an available graphics user based on active order count using aggregation.
    * `sendAssignmentNotification()`: (Placeholder) Sends a notification to the assigned user.
    * `calculatePriority()`: Calculates order priority based on requirements complexity.
    * `calculateEstimatedCompletion()`: Calculates estimated completion time.
    * `createOrder()`: Creates a new order, uploads images (using a local file upload function), assigns it to a graphics user (if available), creates a corresponding `WorkQueueItem`, and schedules an Agenda job for processing.  Uses transactions to ensure data consistency.
    * `getPendingOrders()`: Retrieves pending orders.
    * `reassignUnassignedOrders()`: Reassigns unassigned orders to available graphics users.
    * `getUserAssignedOrders()`: Retrieves orders assigned to a specific user.
    * An Agenda job `process-order` updates order and work queue item statuses during processing and handles potential errors.

* **`workQueueItem.model.js` (4:03:10 PM):** This model defines the schema for work queue items, which track the progress of orders through processing steps.  Notable features include:
    * Pre-save middleware to update order status based on work queue status changes.
    * A virtual `isOverdue` property to check for overdue items.
    * Methods for logging errors and incrementing retry counts.
    * A static method `findNextPendingItem` to efficiently find the next pending item to process.  The schema includes fields for the associated order, status, assigned user, priority, processing steps (with individual statuses and timestamps), start/completion timestamps, estimated completion time, retry count, and an error log.

* **`customer.model.js` (4:20:14 PM, 4:24:34 PM):**  This model, defining the customer schema, was updated to make the `firstName` and `lastName` fields `required`.

* **`user.controller.js` (4:39:20 PM, 4:39:44 PM, 4:40:03 PM):**  This controller experienced multiple revisions, primarily around user authorization and access control in the `deleteUser` function.  The controller handles user signup, account creation (restricted to SuperAdmins), login (with JWT token generation and cookie setting), user information retrieval, password change, fetching all users (with authorization checks for SuperAdmins and Admins), and user deletion (with authorization checks).  The permission to delete users changed from Admin to SuperAdmin across these revisions.

* **`user.routes.js` (4:41:02 PM):** This file defines the routes for user-related functionalities, utilizing middleware for authentication and authorization.

**Frontend Changes:**

* **`UserManagement.jsx` (4:43:19 PM):** This component provides a user interface for managing users.  It fetches users from the backend, allows searching and filtering by role, and includes functionalities for adding and deleting users with confirmation modals.  It uses React, Lucide-React icons, and Axios for API calls.


The overall pattern reveals a system designed for managing orders, assigning tasks to users, and tracking progress through various stages using a work queue.  The backend uses Mongoose for database interactions, Agenda for scheduling tasks, and bcrypt for password hashing.  The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with this system. The changes highlight iterative development, particularly in refining authorization logic and implementing a robust user management system.


## 6:51:53 PM
The log shows development activity on a Metal CRM application, encompassing both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js with Express) components.

The `UserManagement.jsx` file underwent several iterations between 4:44 PM and 4:54 PM.  Initially, it featured user listing, searching, filtering by role, and a modal for adding new users.  The crucial addition at 4:54 PM was the implementation of a `handleDeleteUser` function, enabling user deletion via an API call to `/api/v1/auth/deleteUser/:userId`.  This function also efficiently updates the UI by removing the deleted user from the `users` state without a full refetch, improving performance. The delete button was also made functional.


The `user.controller.js` file, modified between 4:53 PM and 4:53:36 PM, contains the backend logic for user management.  It includes functions for user signup (`signUp`), account creation (`createAccount` - restricted to SuperAdmins), login (`login`), user details retrieval (`getUser`), password change (`changePassword`), fetching all users (`getAllUsers` - also restricted to SuperAdmins or Admins), and user deletion (`deleteUser` - restricted to SuperAdmins).  The `createAccount` function validates the account type against an `allowedAccountTypes` array. The `getAllUsers` function excludes password information from the response. The `deleteUser` function prevents the deletion of SuperAdmin accounts.  No significant code changes occurred in this file between the two timestamps.


The `user.routes.js` file (modified at 4:54 PM) defines the Express.js routes for the user-related endpoints, mapping HTTP methods to the controller functions.  The routes are secured using authentication middleware (`auth`) and, where applicable, SuperAdmin authorization (`isSuperAdmin`).


Finally, a `superadmin.controller.js` file was created at 4:55 PM, containing a simple endpoint that returns a welcome message for SuperAdmins.  This suggests the addition of a separate controller for SuperAdmin-specific functionalities.

In summary, the changes reflect a comprehensive implementation of user management features, incorporating frontend UI elements for interaction and robust backend logic for security and data handling, with clear access control and authorization mechanisms for SuperAdmins and Admins.  The later changes improve efficiency in the frontend through optimized state management during user deletion.
