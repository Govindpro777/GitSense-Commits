# Activity Summary for 3/31/2025

## 10:39:46 AM
The log shows several code changes across two files (`user.models.js` and `order.controller.js`) and one file `Sidebar.jsx` within a Metal CRM application.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\models\user.models.js` (3/31/2025, 9:45:02 AM):** This file defines a Mongoose schema for users.  The schema includes fields for `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `password`, `accountType` (with an enum specifying different user roles), `isActive`, and a `created` timestamp.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\controller\order.controller.js` (Multiple Updates):**  This file contains the controllers for order management. There are multiple revisions of this file over a short period:

* **(3/31/2025, 9:53:45 AM):** Initial commit with functions for creating, assigning, retrieving, updating, deleting, and approving orders. The `createOrder` function includes commented-out cloudinary image upload functionality.  Order IDs are sequentially generated.  The code populates related fields (customer, assignedTo, createdBy) using `.populate()`.

* **(3/31/2025, 9:54:48 AM):**  A change in the `createOrder` function.  When assigning an order (`assignedTo` field), the assigned user's `isActive` field is set to `true`. This implies a user activation mechanism upon order assignment.

* **(3/31/2025, 9:58:04 AM):** The `createOrder` function is further modified to add a check preventing orders from being assigned to users with the `accountType` of "Graphics".  The commented-out code to update the assigned user's `isActive` property is still present.


* **(3/31/2025, 9:58:42 AM):** The commented-out code to update `isActive` is removed from `createOrder`.  This suggests a decision to decouple user activation from order assignment.

* **(3/31/2025, 10:11:40 AM):** This revision is identical to the one at 9:58:42 AM.


The `order.controller.js` file consistently uses Mongoose's `findById`, `findByIdAndUpdate`, and `find` methods for database interactions.  Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks.  The code also shows a potential integration with a cloudinary image storage service (commented-out initially).

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\components\New folder\Sidebar.jsx` (3/31/2025, 10:00:47 AM):** This React component renders a sidebar menu based on the user's `accountType` stored in localStorage.  The menu dynamically adapts to display different options for different user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts). The sidebar includes a logout button.  The menu structure is clearly defined in the `menuItems` object, making it easy to maintain and extend.


## 11:39:43 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `ImageUploader.js` on March 31st, 2025.  The main function, `localFileUpload`, handles local file uploads using `express-fileupload`, `path`, and `fs` modules.  It ensures the input `files` is an array, creates a directory ("files") if it doesn't exist, and uploads each file, assigning a timestamped filename.  The commented-out code suggests that cloudinary integration was previously considered, but it was removed in later commits.

Specific changes across the revisions include:

* **11:31:29 AM:** Initial commit of `localFileUpload`. The upload directory was initially set to `path.join(__dirname, "files")`.
* **11:33:23 AM:** The upload directory path was modified to `path.join(__dirname, "../files")`, changing the relative path to the parent directory.
* **11:39:19 AM:** A minor change in code formatting; backticks were added around `${Date.now()}_${file.name}` for better string interpolation clarity.  The upload directory path reverted back to `path.join(__dirname, "files")`.  No functional changes were made.

The commented-out `uploadImageToCloudinary` function indicates an intention to support cloudinary uploads, possibly abandoned during development.  The consistent use of promises and error handling (`try...catch`) is evident throughout the code.


## 2:43:47 PM
The `graphics.controller.js` file underwent several revisions on March 31st, 2025.  The main focus of the changes was the `createOrder` function.

Initially, the code used `uploadImageToCloudinary` for image uploads. This was later commented out, and  `localFileUpload` was implemented instead.  There were also several intermediate commits where the `localFileUpload` was commented out, indicating potential experimentation or debugging.  The final version correctly handles cases where no images are uploaded by initializing `imageUrls` as an empty array and only calling `localFileUpload` if `files` exist.


Between 2:30:37 PM and 2:33:05 PM, there were multiple iterations to handle file uploads more robustly.  The initial version directly accessed `req.files.images`, which was improved to handle the case where `req.files.images` might be null or undefined using a conditional operator (`req.files && req.files.images ? req.files.images : null`). The commented out cloudinary upload suggests a shift in the image storage strategy.


The other functions (`findAvailableGraphicsUser`, `sendAssignmentNotification`, `calculatePriority`, `calculateEstimatedCompletion`, `getPendingOrders`, `reassignUnassignedOrders`, `getUserAssignedOrders`, and the `process-order` agenda job) remained largely unchanged throughout these revisions.  These functions manage order creation, assignment, and processing workflows, leveraging MongoDB aggregation for user selection and transactional operations using Mongoose sessions to ensure data consistency.  The `process-order` agenda job handles the asynchronous processing of orders.  There is consistent use of error handling with try-catch blocks and transaction management to ensure reliability.
