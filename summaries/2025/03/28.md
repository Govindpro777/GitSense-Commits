# Activity Summary for 3/28/2025

## 10:31:21 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\EditOrder.jsx` underwent two modifications on March 28th, 2025.

The first change, at 9:34:06 AM, introduced a React component, `EditOrderPopup`, which is a modal popup for editing orders. This popup features improved styling and responsiveness compared to the original component.  The original `EditOrder` component was commented out. The `EditOrderPopup` uses a `onClose` prop to manage closure, improving the user experience.


The second change, at 9:36:02 AM, removed the `EditOrderPopup` component, reverting the file to a previous version. The commented-out code was removed from the `EditOrder` component that was now the only component in the file. This suggests that the decision to create a popup was temporary. The key functional differences between the versions were the method of displaying the form (modal vs. full page) and the way it handles closing (using a prop `onClose` for the modal vs. navigating to another route).  Both versions utilize similar fetch calls to retrieve and update order data using a token from local storage and a base URL from environment variables.  The styling changed with font sizes, and some spacing and component sizes adjustments.


## 4:29:38 PM
The primary change on March 28th, 2025, at 3:30:22 PM involved the `App.tsx` file.  This file, the main application component, was updated to implement routing using `react-router-dom`.  The update introduced routes for login (`/login`), patient dashboard (`/patient/:id`), consultation view (`/consultation/:id`), test results (`/test-results/:id`), and appointment list (`/appointments`).  Authentication is managed via a state variable `isAuthenticated`, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.  All authenticated routes are wrapped within a `Layout` component, suggesting a consistent header/footer structure.  The initial authentication state is set to `true` for testing purposes, which may need to be updated for a production environment.
