# Activity Summary for 3/28/2025

## 10:31:21 AM
The file `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-frontend\src\pages\EditOrder.jsx` underwent two modifications on March 28th, 2025.

The first change, at 9:34:06 AM, introduced a React component, `EditOrderPopup`, which is a modal popup for editing orders. This popup features improved styling and responsiveness compared to the original component.  The original `EditOrder` component was commented out. The `EditOrderPopup` uses a `onClose` prop to manage closure, improving the user experience.


The second change, at 9:36:02 AM, removed the `EditOrderPopup` component, reverting the file to a previous version. The commented-out code was removed from the `EditOrder` component that was now the only component in the file. This suggests that the decision to create a popup was temporary. The key functional differences between the versions were the method of displaying the form (modal vs. full page) and the way it handles closing (using a prop `onClose` for the modal vs. navigating to another route).  Both versions utilize similar fetch calls to retrieve and update order data using a token from local storage and a base URL from environment variables.  The styling changed with font sizes, and some spacing and component sizes adjustments.


## 4:29:38 PM
The primary change on March 28th, 2025, at 3:30:22 PM involved the `App.tsx` file.  This file, the main application component, was updated to implement routing using `react-router-dom`.  The update introduced routes for login (`/login`), patient dashboard (`/patient/:id`), consultation view (`/consultation/:id`), test results (`/test-results/:id`), and appointment list (`/appointments`).  Authentication is managed via a state variable `isAuthenticated`, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.  All authenticated routes are wrapped within a `Layout` component, suggesting a consistent header/footer structure.  The initial authentication state is set to `true` for testing purposes, which may need to be updated for a production environment.


## 6:31:20 PM
The log shows a series of edits to the `navbar.tsx` component and the `package.json` file.  The `navbar.tsx` component underwent significant changes related to its logo and navigation. Initially, the logo was a complex SVG, then it was replaced by a simple text-based logo ("XpertBuddy"), subsequently replaced again with an image imported from "@/public/Group 316127881.png".  The "Home" navigation link also changed from "Home" to "Find Tutor" and "Projects" link changed to "HomeWork" at different times. These changes happened rapidly between 6:06 PM and 6:30 PM on March 28, 2025.  Finally, the `navbar.tsx` component was entirely commented out at 6:26 PM and 6:27 PM, before being restored in a final version using the image logo.

The `package.json` file was updated at 6:11 PM on March 28, 2025. This update lists various dependencies and devDependencies, including React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and several UI component libraries from Radix UI.  This suggests a project using Next.js with a heavy reliance on pre-built UI components.  The version of Next.js is 15.1.0 and React is version 19.
The changes to `app/page.tsx` involved adjustments to the hero section image height and width between 6:19 PM and 6:20 PM, ultimately settling on a height of 650px and width of 500px.  A new logo was added, imported from "@/public/Group 316127881.png", which is consistent with the changes made to the navbar.
