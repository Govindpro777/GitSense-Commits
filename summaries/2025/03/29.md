# Activity Summary for 3/29/2025

## 12:02:22 AM
The log shows a series of edits to the `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Exper-Buddy\app\page.tsx` file between 11:06 PM and 12:02 AM on March 28th and 29th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the transformation of the homepage's hero section.

Initially, the page featured a hero section with two buttons ("Get Started" and "Submit a Project"), a background image, and company logos.  Between 11:11 PM and 11:19 PM, the buttons were removed and replaced with a form to submit project descriptions, including a toggle switch for "Human experts only."  A "Find an Expert" button was added to submit the form.  The `handleSubmit` function was also defined during this period, although it currently only logs the form's data.  Import statements for `<Input>` and `<Switch>` components were added at 11:14 PM.  The height and width of the `<Input>` component were adjusted repeatedly between 11:16 PM and 11:19 PM, settling on `w-[460px] h-[150px]`.


The background image implementation changed several times. Initially, it used the `Image` component. Later attempts involved inline styles and finally, at 11:59 PM, it used `url(${bgImage.src})`  This last version uses a background image stored in `@/public/bg-pattern.png`. The file `@/public/Pattern-Bg-1 2.png` was used in various attempts, then commented out.  The `ml-14` class was added for left margin adjustment in the hero section around 11:26 PM, further refined to `ml-48` at 11:59 PM and ultimately removed. `container mx-auto px-4` was also removed at 11:58 PM.

Around 11:35 PM, a `ReviewRatings` component was added, indicating the inclusion of a review section on the page. This component's styling was adjusted slightly in the later edits,  mostly regarding background color (`bg-gray-50`, `bg-[#f1efeb]`, and `bg-white`).

Finally, elements such as the "Book Now" and "AI Powered" sections, initially present, were commented out by 11:32 PM. The color of the paragraph text under the heading was also changed from `text-[#6b7b93]` to `text-[#16192c]` around 12:02 AM.  The overall change suggests a shift from a general introduction to a more project-focused design, emphasizing the submission of projects rather than general navigation.


## 1:02:21 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to the `page.tsx` file between 12:02 AM and 12:10 AM on March 29th, 2025, primarily focusing on styling adjustments within the Hero section.  These changes involve modifying text colors (`text-[#16192c]`, `text-[#a414d5]`), font weights (`font-bold`, `font-medium`, `font-semibold`), font sizes (`text-lg`, `text-xl`, `text-2xl`, `text-3xl`, `text-base`), and adding/removing  `font-sans` and other styling classes to adjust text appearance, as well as some margin and padding adjustments.  There is also one change to the input field placeholder text, removing it in one version and adding it back in another.  The `ml-48` and `ml-56` adjustments indicate changes to the left margin of the hero section's content. The most significant changes happen in quick succession around 12:04 AM.


Between 12:13 AM and 12:22 AM, the `Review.tsx` component underwent a major restructuring. Initially, it displayed review ratings using inline SVGs and conditional rendering for images.  Subsequently, it was refactored to utilize the Next.js `Image` component for improved image handling and layout.  The styling also evolved from a more compact layout to a cleaner, more spaced-out design with larger icons and text, using flexbox for better alignment and responsiveness. The changes culminated in a visually improved and more robust review section.

The `faq.tsx` file was updated between 12:34 AM and 12:35 AM, primarily altering the questions and answers. One question was rephrased for clarity, and a new question about exam assistance was added.  A question about Appointy pricing was changed to a more generic "How much will it cost?" question. Another question about payment methods was briefly added then replaced by an identical answer to the exam help question.

Finally, the `signup-modal.tsx` file was modified repeatedly between 12:37 AM and 12:51 AM.  The initial changes focused on refining the modal's title and removing some unnecessary elements from the form.  Later revisions simplified the modal to only require an email address, adding User Agreement and marketing preference checkboxes and removing the name and password fields. The styling of the modal was also refined, particularly concerning the rounded corners (`rounded-xl`, `rounded-3xl`, `rounded-5xl`), height adjustments (`h-[300px]`, `h-[350px]`), and button width (`w-[150px]`). The background opacity of the modal overlay was also adjusted (`bg-black/50`, `bg-black/15`, `bg-black/10`, `bg-black/20`).  The final version of the component uses a functional approach with an explicit `handleClose` function.
