# Activity Summary for 3/29/2025

## 12:02:22 AM
The log shows a series of edits to the `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Exper-Buddy\app\page.tsx` file between 11:06 PM and 12:02 AM on March 28th and 29th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the transformation of the homepage's hero section.

Initially, the page featured a hero section with two buttons ("Get Started" and "Submit a Project"), a background image, and company logos.  Between 11:11 PM and 11:19 PM, the buttons were removed and replaced with a form to submit project descriptions, including a toggle switch for "Human experts only."  A "Find an Expert" button was added to submit the form.  The `handleSubmit` function was also defined during this period, although it currently only logs the form's data.  Import statements for `<Input>` and `<Switch>` components were added at 11:14 PM.  The height and width of the `<Input>` component were adjusted repeatedly between 11:16 PM and 11:19 PM, settling on `w-[460px] h-[150px]`.


The background image implementation changed several times. Initially, it used the `Image` component. Later attempts involved inline styles and finally, at 11:59 PM, it used `url(${bgImage.src})`  This last version uses a background image stored in `@/public/bg-pattern.png`. The file `@/public/Pattern-Bg-1 2.png` was used in various attempts, then commented out.  The `ml-14` class was added for left margin adjustment in the hero section around 11:26 PM, further refined to `ml-48` at 11:59 PM and ultimately removed. `container mx-auto px-4` was also removed at 11:58 PM.

Around 11:35 PM, a `ReviewRatings` component was added, indicating the inclusion of a review section on the page. This component's styling was adjusted slightly in the later edits,  mostly regarding background color (`bg-gray-50`, `bg-[#f1efeb]`, and `bg-white`).

Finally, elements such as the "Book Now" and "AI Powered" sections, initially present, were commented out by 11:32 PM. The color of the paragraph text under the heading was also changed from `text-[#6b7b93]` to `text-[#16192c]` around 12:02 AM.  The overall change suggests a shift from a general introduction to a more project-focused design, emphasizing the submission of projects rather than general navigation.
