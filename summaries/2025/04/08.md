# Activity Summary for 4/8/2025

## 12:06:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` component between 8:24 PM and 11:43 PM on April 7th, 2025.  The component displays details of an order, including order information (ID, customer, creation date, status), additional details (assigned to, requirements), order images, and associated files.  No changes were made to the core functionality of the component across the revisions.  The code remained consistent throughout the various timestamps.  The component fetches file data using a GET request to an API endpoint (`/api/files/order/${order._id}`) and handles loading and error states.  File downloads are implemented using a client-side approach with a temporary form and the addition of an authorization token in a hidden input field.  The status of the order is color-coded using the `getStatusColor` function.  There are no apparent significant functional changes between the various commits.


## 12:48:03 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `HomeworkBanner.js` and `ReviewCard.js` between 4/7/2025 and 4/8/2025.

`HomeworkBanner.js` underwent several revisions within a short time frame (11:53 PM to 11:58 PM on 4/7/2025).  These revisions primarily involved styling adjustments and minor code cleanup.  There's a notable change at 11:57 PM where the component structure was significantly altered, likely for improved responsiveness across different screen sizes (mobile vs. desktop).  Specific changes include updated class names to incorporate more responsive design elements, adjustments to text sizes using Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `text-H1`, `text-P2`), and the addition of mobile-specific UI elements (like a separate mobile "offer" section).  The `handleSubmit` function remained largely unchanged throughout the revisions.


`ReviewCard.js` was modified later (4/8/2025, 12:03 AM to 12:15 AM).  These changes appear to be related to the implementation of a review carousel.  The code is largely commented out, suggesting iterative development or testing. The file contains substantial styling and layout code for displaying reviews, platform badges (with logos and ratings), and navigation controls for the carousel.  The code uses `Image` components from `next/image`, indicating the use of images for logos and star ratings.  The implementation accounts for both mobile and desktop views, with different layouts and navigation methods for each.  Multiple edits to this file suggest adjustments to the carousel's functionality and styling.


## 1:48:06 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `HomeworkBanner.js` between 1:18 AM and 1:47 AM on April 8th, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be styling and layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  The component renders a banner with text, an image, a form, and a switch.

Early revisions (1:18 AM - 1:21 AM) involved significant restructuring of the component's layout, shifting from a commented-out, more static layout to a more dynamic and responsive design that utilizes viewport units (`vw`) for sizing elements.  The component name was also changed from `HomePage` to `HomeworkBanner`.  The `Switch` component was also made functional and interactive.

Subsequent revisions (1:25 AM - 1:34 AM) focused on refining the styling, particularly of the headings and paragraphs.  This involved adjustments to text sizes (`text-[28px]`, `md:text-H2`, etc.) across different screen sizes.  The `textarea` element's styling also underwent multiple iterations, changing its `max-width` and `width` properties.

Later revisions (1:37 AM - 1:47 AM) concentrated on further layout improvements.  The outer container's class names were significantly altered to control the overall structure and responsiveness, notably moving towards using `max-w-screen-2xl` for a more controlled max width.  The margins and padding (`px-4`, `md:px-8`, `xl:px-16`, etc.) were also adjusted for different screen sizes.  The `mt` (margin-top) value for the left content section was repeatedly adjusted based on whether a `jwtToken` exists.  Finally,  the left content's padding was increased for improved spacing, and the `max-width` of the paragraph was changed to `max-w-xl` for better readability on larger screens.  The overall structure changed from using `mx-auto` for centering to utilizing `justify-center` within flex containers for better control over alignment and responsiveness.  The image container was simplified by removing unnecessary nested divs.
