# Activity Summary for 4/8/2025

## 12:06:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` component between 8:24 PM and 11:43 PM on April 7th, 2025.  The component displays details of an order, including order information (ID, customer, creation date, status), additional details (assigned to, requirements), order images, and associated files.  No changes were made to the core functionality of the component across the revisions.  The code remained consistent throughout the various timestamps.  The component fetches file data using a GET request to an API endpoint (`/api/files/order/${order._id}`) and handles loading and error states.  File downloads are implemented using a client-side approach with a temporary form and the addition of an authorization token in a hidden input field.  The status of the order is color-coded using the `getStatusColor` function.  There are no apparent significant functional changes between the various commits.


## 12:48:03 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `HomeworkBanner.js` and `ReviewCard.js` between 4/7/2025 and 4/8/2025.

`HomeworkBanner.js` underwent several revisions within a short time frame (11:53 PM to 11:58 PM on 4/7/2025).  These revisions primarily involved styling adjustments and minor code cleanup.  There's a notable change at 11:57 PM where the component structure was significantly altered, likely for improved responsiveness across different screen sizes (mobile vs. desktop).  Specific changes include updated class names to incorporate more responsive design elements, adjustments to text sizes using Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `text-H1`, `text-P2`), and the addition of mobile-specific UI elements (like a separate mobile "offer" section).  The `handleSubmit` function remained largely unchanged throughout the revisions.


`ReviewCard.js` was modified later (4/8/2025, 12:03 AM to 12:15 AM).  These changes appear to be related to the implementation of a review carousel.  The code is largely commented out, suggesting iterative development or testing. The file contains substantial styling and layout code for displaying reviews, platform badges (with logos and ratings), and navigation controls for the carousel.  The code uses `Image` components from `next/image`, indicating the use of images for logos and star ratings.  The implementation accounts for both mobile and desktop views, with different layouts and navigation methods for each.  Multiple edits to this file suggest adjustments to the carousel's functionality and styling.


## 1:48:06 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `HomeworkBanner.js` between 1:18 AM and 1:47 AM on April 8th, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be styling and layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  The component renders a banner with text, an image, a form, and a switch.

Early revisions (1:18 AM - 1:21 AM) involved significant restructuring of the component's layout, shifting from a commented-out, more static layout to a more dynamic and responsive design that utilizes viewport units (`vw`) for sizing elements.  The component name was also changed from `HomePage` to `HomeworkBanner`.  The `Switch` component was also made functional and interactive.

Subsequent revisions (1:25 AM - 1:34 AM) focused on refining the styling, particularly of the headings and paragraphs.  This involved adjustments to text sizes (`text-[28px]`, `md:text-H2`, etc.) across different screen sizes.  The `textarea` element's styling also underwent multiple iterations, changing its `max-width` and `width` properties.

Later revisions (1:37 AM - 1:47 AM) concentrated on further layout improvements.  The outer container's class names were significantly altered to control the overall structure and responsiveness, notably moving towards using `max-w-screen-2xl` for a more controlled max width.  The margins and padding (`px-4`, `md:px-8`, `xl:px-16`, etc.) were also adjusted for different screen sizes.  The `mt` (margin-top) value for the left content section was repeatedly adjusted based on whether a `jwtToken` exists.  Finally,  the left content's padding was increased for improved spacing, and the `max-width` of the paragraph was changed to `max-w-xl` for better readability on larger screens.  The overall structure changed from using `mx-auto` for centering to utilizing `justify-center` within flex containers for better control over alignment and responsiveness.  The image container was simplified by removing unnecessary nested divs.


## 2:48:11 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `HomeworkBanner.js` and `TrustHomework.js` between 1:48 AM and 2:14 AM, and then further revisions to `TrustHomework.js` until 2:38 AM, followed by changes to `ReachoutExperts.js` between 2:42 AM and 2:47 AM.

**`HomeworkBanner.js`**:  The major changes involved adjustments to the layout and styling using Tailwind CSS.  The component is a banner for homework help, featuring a headline, a description, a form with a text area and a switch (likely for human expert preference), and an image.  Multiple revisions focused on refining the responsiveness (adjusting `className` attributes for different screen sizes â€“ `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `sm`),  margin (`mt`, `ml`, `mb`, `mx`), padding (`px`, `py`), and sizing of elements (e.g., `w-full`, `max-w-md`, `h-[100px]`).  There's a consistent use of  `text-[#16192c]` for text color and `bg-[#A414D5]` (a purple shade) for button styling. The final version at 2:14 AM seems to represent a stable and well-structured layout.

**`TrustHomework.js`**: This component displays student testimonials and review scores from Trustpilot, Sitejabber, and ExpertBuddy.  The initial revisions (2:15 AM - 2:21 AM) primarily involved updating text sizes and font styles using Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `text-p1`, `text-H6`, `text-P2`, `text-p5`) to improve readability and visual hierarchy.  Subsequent revisions focused on restructuring the layout, switching from individual styling to a more reusable `ReviewBox` component (around 2:21 AM), leading to a cleaner and more maintainable code structure. This component has a lot of responsive adjustments based on screen sizes.

**`ReachoutExperts.js`**:  This component is a call to action section encouraging users to contact experts.  The changes involved updating the styling using Tailwind CSS, focusing on responsiveness (using the `md`, `lg`, and `sm` breakpoints).  The adjustments include  adjustments to margins, padding, text sizes, and the overall layout. The changes from 2:42 AM to 2:47 AM  show a move towards better organization and responsive design with the introduction of `container`, `max-w-7xl` and more deliberate use of responsive sizes.  The final version features a more visually appealing and better-organized structure.


## 3:48:10 AM
The log shows a series of edits to two React component files: `ReachoutExperts.js` and `HomeworkBanner.js`.  The changes span approximately 30 minutes, from 2:48 AM to 3:18 AM.

**ReachoutExperts.js:**  This component underwent extensive styling adjustments.  Multiple revisions focused on responsiveness and layout, primarily using Tailwind CSS classes.  Changes include adjustments to `max-height`, `width`, and  positioning attributes  (`mx-auto`, `md:mx-0`, `justify-between`, `items-center`,  `px-4`, etc.) across different screen sizes (using Tailwind's responsive modifiers like `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`). The image sizes and aspect ratios are repeatedly modified for better responsiveness. The most significant changes occurred between 3:04 AM and 3:18 AM, where the image component was restructured, and the component's `min-height` was removed and replaced with `min-h-screen` and later adjusted again.  A pattern of refining the visual presentation and responsiveness is evident throughout the edits.


**HomeworkBanner.js:** This component also received several revisions, primarily focused on layout adjustments and styling improvements.  The modifications to `mt-` (margin-top) values suggest adjustments to vertical spacing  between elements depending on screen size and authentication state.  The changes from 2:56 AM to 3:03 AM focused on refining margins and element placement for better responsiveness and aesthetics. The final changes at around 3:03 AM indicate a shift from a `flex-row` to a `flex-col` layout on smaller screens for the overall structure and improvements to the button sizing and text style.  Similar to `ReachoutExperts.js`, the changes demonstrate a consistent effort to improve the visual appeal and responsiveness of the component.


## 10:06:12 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `How-It-Works.js` component and the `ReviewCard.js` component within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project.  The majority of changes are focused on styling and layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  There's also some evolution in the content itself, particularly in the `How-It-Works` component.

**How-It-Works.js:**

* **Initial commits (4/8/2025, 3:48:35 AM - 3:50:59 AM):** These commits show significant restructuring of the component.  The initial version was heavily commented-out and contained a three-step process with images. Subsequent revisions streamlined the layout, focusing on responsive design with Tailwind's responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).  The number of steps initially presented is three, but this later becomes two. The styling is refined throughout these early changes, shifting from pixel-based measurements to more flexible Tailwind classes. The button text also changed.  A key change is the transition from a three-column layout for steps 1, 2, and 3 to a two-column layout, then a different arrangement where steps 1 and 2 are side-by-side.

* **Later Commits (4/8/2025, 3:52:30 AM - 4:08:21 AM):** Further refinements to the layout and styling of the `How-It-Works` component.  Image imports were added and updated as the number of steps evolved.  The step content also changes and the number of steps appears to change from 2 to 3 again.  The titles and descriptions are adjusted for clarity.

* **Major Overhaul (4/8/2025, 4:07:40 AM):** This commit represents a significant change, replacing much of the previous code with a new structure and a revised approach to the layout.  The number of steps is again revised, this time to only two. This version introduces a more concise and consistent design.

**ReviewCard.js:**

* **Initial Commit (4/8/2025, 4:09:00 AM):** The initial commit for `ReviewCard.js` presents a commented-out carousel component with several features such as platform data, review data, and image path mapping for logos and star ratings.  The component renders platform badges and review cards, supporting responsive design.

* **Subsequent Commits (4/8/2025, 9:21:37 AM - 10:04:41 AM):** The subsequent changes to `ReviewCard.js` primarily involve commenting and uncommenting sections of the code, with no significant functional changes.  This may indicate experimentation or temporary removal of code blocks during development.


**Recurring Patterns:**

* **Extensive use of Tailwind CSS:**  The code consistently uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout.
* **Responsive Design:**  Tailwind's responsive modifiers are heavily used to ensure the components adapt to different screen sizes.
* **Image Handling:** The components rely on several images, and there are several imports and updates to these image paths throughout the changes.  The paths consistently use the format `../../../public/landing-page/...`.
* **Iterative Development:** The numerous commits demonstrate an iterative development process with frequent small changes to layout and content.



The overall pattern suggests a focus on improving the user interface of the landing page through incremental design iterations, primarily using Tailwind CSS to manage the responsive aspects of the website design.


## 10:09:48 AM
The `GraphicsOrders` component in `GraphicsOrder.jsx` (last updated 4/8/2025, 9:10:28 AM) displays and manages graphics orders.  It fetches order data from an API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/assigned`) using a token from local storage.  The fetched data is then displayed, allowing for searching by order ID or requirements, filtering by status (Pending, InProgress, Completed, Failed, Paused), and updating order status via POST request to `/api/v1/admin/updateWorkQueue`.

The component uses `useState` extensively to manage component state, including order data, search terms, filters, and feedback messages for status updates and file uploads.  Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks and `setTimeout` to clear temporary messages.

Visual elements utilize `lucide-react` icons and Tailwind CSS for styling.  File uploads are handled using a FormData object, allowing the upload of multiple CAD and image files. Client-side validation ensures at least one CAD and one image file are selected before initiating the upload.  The uploaded files are sent to the `/api/v1/admin/fileupload` endpoint.  A modal displays previews of uploaded images.  Finally, a refresh button allows the user to manually refetch the order data.  The code extensively uses functional components and hooks provided by React.


## 11:50:39 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ReviewCard.js` and `FAQHomework.js` components between 10:53 AM and 11:48 AM on April 8th, 2025.  `ReviewCard.js` underwent numerous revisions with no discernible pattern in the code itself beyond repeated updates to the component's styling and structure; the code remained functionally similar throughout all revisions.  The `FAQHomework.js` component was only modified once, at 11:06:12 AM, indicating the addition of an FAQ accordion component using Next.js's `Image` component.

The most significant changes to `ReviewCard.js` appear to be minor adjustments made between 10:53 and 11:00 AM, and again around 11:12 AM.  These edits likely involved refinements to the layout and presentation of review cards.  After 11:12 AM, there are no functional changes detected.  The component displays a carousel of reviews from various platforms (ExpertBuddy, Trustpilot, Sitejabber, Reviews.io, Review Centre),  featuring a star rating system and platform logos.  The `imagePaths` constant suggests a complex image management system to handle different logos and star icons.


The `FAQHomework.js` file was updated only once with the addition of an accordion component that displays frequently asked questions.  The styling uses responsive design principles.
