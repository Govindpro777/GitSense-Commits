# Activity Summary for 4/8/2025

## 12:06:41 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` component between 8:24 PM and 11:43 PM on April 7th, 2025.  The component displays details of an order, including order information (ID, customer, creation date, status), additional details (assigned to, requirements), order images, and associated files.  No changes were made to the core functionality of the component across the revisions.  The code remained consistent throughout the various timestamps.  The component fetches file data using a GET request to an API endpoint (`/api/files/order/${order._id}`) and handles loading and error states.  File downloads are implemented using a client-side approach with a temporary form and the addition of an authorization token in a hidden input field.  The status of the order is color-coded using the `getStatusColor` function.  There are no apparent significant functional changes between the various commits.
