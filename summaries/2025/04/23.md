# Activity Summary for 4/23/2025

## 10:16:12 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `StudyBay.js` and `ReviewCard.js`, both located within the `src\components\landingPage` directory of a React frontend project.  The changes span approximately 30 minutes on April 23, 2025.

`StudyBay.js`: This file contains a carousel component (`ExpertBuddyCarousel`).  The primary changes involved adjustments to the styling of the main heading (`h2`) within the carousel.  Specifically, the `text-[44px]` class was added and subsequently modified or removed  in several commits. This suggests iterative adjustments to the heading's font size for responsiveness across different screen sizes.  The `<br>` tag within the heading was also modified, initially present and then removed within the `sm:hidden` class. The final version of the code shows the `text-[28px] md:text-[38px] lg:text-[44px]` to control font size based on screen size. There were also minor adjustments to the margin sizes (`mt`, `mb`).

`ReviewCard.js`: This file depicts a reviews carousel component (`ReviewsCarousel`). The main focus of the modifications appears to be on the styling and responsiveness of the heading (`h2`)  "Reviews from XpertBuddy Community". Similar to `StudyBay.js`, this involved several commits altering the `text` class, indicating adjustments for different screen sizes (`2xs`, `xs`, `text-[28px]`, `md:text-[38px]`, `lg:text-[44px]`). There are also minor changes to the positioning of an image (`Image`) element through modifications to its CSS classes (`absolute -top-4`, etc).   The final commit included consistent adjustments to the `xs` and `2xs` sizes for the headline.


A recurring pattern across both files is the extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design, adapting the UI elements based on screen size breakpoints.  Both components utilize the `react-slick` library for carousel functionality and  `next/image` for image rendering.  The changes are primarily focused on styling refinements, particularly to ensure optimal visual presentation across a range of devices.
