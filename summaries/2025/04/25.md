# Activity Summary for 4/25/2025

## 12:03:56 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to the `CreateProject.js` component  between 11:09 PM and 11:48 PM on April 24th, 2025, and further updates on April 25th, 2025.  The majority of the changes seem focused on UI refinements and the addition of a payment summary section.

Initially, `CreateProject.js` was primarily commented-out code representing a landing page component with tabs, a hero banner, and sections describing project creation.  The uncommented portion was a very basic structure.  Over several minutes,  significant portions were progressively uncommented and refined with increasingly detailed styling using Tailwind CSS classes. The commented-out code was completely removed in the final revision.


Between 11:09 PM and 11:25 PM, multiple commits show iterative changes to the styling and layout of the landing page elements. The changes are incremental, suggesting a process of continuous refinement and adjustment. The component eventually included interactive tabs, a hero banner with an image, and a "It's So Easy" section with card components.


At 11:54 PM on April 24th, a new file, `src\app\projects\payment\page.jsx`, was added. This file uses the `CreateProject` component.  Then at 11:54 PM, a `Payment.js` component was added, initially showing just "Payment".

A major addition occurred at 12:02 AM on April 25th to `Payment.js`, introducing a detailed payment summary UI. This section includes options for full or partial payments, various payment methods (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, and Stripe), and a wallet balance display, with the display of coupon and terms and conditions. This suggests the development of a fully functional payment flow was added.

The final commits to `CreateProject.js` after 11:44 PM only include minor adjustments, suggesting the main functionality and UI are finalized, and the  `Payment` component is integrated within the broader project.  The final version of `CreateProject.js` is fully implemented. There was no further changes after 11:48 PM on April 24th, 2025, to `CreateProject.js` except the final commit at 11:48 PM which removes the commented out code.
