# Activity Summary for 4/25/2025

## 12:03:56 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to the `CreateProject.js` component  between 11:09 PM and 11:48 PM on April 24th, 2025, and further updates on April 25th, 2025.  The majority of the changes seem focused on UI refinements and the addition of a payment summary section.

Initially, `CreateProject.js` was primarily commented-out code representing a landing page component with tabs, a hero banner, and sections describing project creation.  The uncommented portion was a very basic structure.  Over several minutes,  significant portions were progressively uncommented and refined with increasingly detailed styling using Tailwind CSS classes. The commented-out code was completely removed in the final revision.


Between 11:09 PM and 11:25 PM, multiple commits show iterative changes to the styling and layout of the landing page elements. The changes are incremental, suggesting a process of continuous refinement and adjustment. The component eventually included interactive tabs, a hero banner with an image, and a "It's So Easy" section with card components.


At 11:54 PM on April 24th, a new file, `src\app\projects\payment\page.jsx`, was added. This file uses the `CreateProject` component.  Then at 11:54 PM, a `Payment.js` component was added, initially showing just "Payment".

A major addition occurred at 12:02 AM on April 25th to `Payment.js`, introducing a detailed payment summary UI. This section includes options for full or partial payments, various payment methods (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, and Stripe), and a wallet balance display, with the display of coupon and terms and conditions. This suggests the development of a fully functional payment flow was added.

The final commits to `CreateProject.js` after 11:44 PM only include minor adjustments, suggesting the main functionality and UI are finalized, and the  `Payment` component is integrated within the broader project.  The final version of `CreateProject.js` is fully implemented. There was no further changes after 11:48 PM on April 24th, 2025, to `CreateProject.js` except the final commit at 11:48 PM which removes the commented out code.


## 1:03:58 AM
The log shows iterative changes to `Payment.js`, a React component for a payment summary page.  The majority of changes focus on styling using Tailwind CSS, progressively enhancing the UI from mobile-first design to larger screen sizes.  There's consistent use of `Image` components from `next/image`,  and several SVG icons are used throughout (`/landing-page/project/full.svg`, `/landing-page/project/partial.svg`, `/landing-page/project/visa.svg`, `/landing-page/project/paypal.svg`, `/landing-page/project/stripe.svg`, `/landing-page/project/avtar.svg`, `/landing-page/project/flag.svg`, `/landing-page/project/star.svg`, `/landing-page/project/wallet.svg`, `/landing-page/i.svg`).

Between 12:08 AM and 12:16 AM, the primary modifications involved adding payment method options (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, Paypal, Stripe), refining the layout and adding image placeholders.  The initial versions lacked crucial elements like the "Confirm Payment" button and comprehensive styling.

From 12:16 AM onwards, the focus shifts to improving the visual presentation.  Changes include adjusting font sizes (`text-[18px]`, `text-[23px]`, `text-[14px]`), adding rounded corners (`rounded-[20px]`, `rounded-full`), modifying background and border colors (`bg-purple-50`, `border-[#A414D5]`, `bg-[#381F32]`), and updating the component's overall styling with Tailwind classes.  The image paths are also standardized under the `/landing-page/project/` directory.  Specifically, the avatar image source was changed from `/expert-avatar.jpg` to `/landing-page/project/avtar.svg`.

Around 12:53 AM, significant changes were introduced.  The `useRef` hook and additional state variables (`showPartialInfo`, `showProcessingInfo`, `showCouponInfo`) were added to manage the visibility of informational tooltips. These tooltips provide more details on processing fees and coupon codes, improving user understanding. The position of the tooltips (`absolute right-0` initially, then adjusting position to `right-4` then `right-8`) was also adjusted for better visual placement. The styling was further refined to better match design specifications. This is evident in the adjustments made to `text` and `bg` colors, font sizes and weights and addition of `gap` and classes like `justify-center`. Finally, a minor change was implemented in the last commit at 12:56 AM by adding a `useRef` to `processingInfoRef` that was previously commented out.  A similar `useRef` was applied to the coupon information tooltip.

In summary, the development process followed a pattern of adding core functionality first, followed by iterative styling and UI enhancements, culminating in the addition of interactive tooltips for clarifying payment details.  The consistent use of SVG icons suggests a design preference for scalability and maintainability.
