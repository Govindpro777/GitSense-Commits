# Activity Summary for 4/25/2025

## 12:03:56 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to the `CreateProject.js` component  between 11:09 PM and 11:48 PM on April 24th, 2025, and further updates on April 25th, 2025.  The majority of the changes seem focused on UI refinements and the addition of a payment summary section.

Initially, `CreateProject.js` was primarily commented-out code representing a landing page component with tabs, a hero banner, and sections describing project creation.  The uncommented portion was a very basic structure.  Over several minutes,  significant portions were progressively uncommented and refined with increasingly detailed styling using Tailwind CSS classes. The commented-out code was completely removed in the final revision.


Between 11:09 PM and 11:25 PM, multiple commits show iterative changes to the styling and layout of the landing page elements. The changes are incremental, suggesting a process of continuous refinement and adjustment. The component eventually included interactive tabs, a hero banner with an image, and a "It's So Easy" section with card components.


At 11:54 PM on April 24th, a new file, `src\app\projects\payment\page.jsx`, was added. This file uses the `CreateProject` component.  Then at 11:54 PM, a `Payment.js` component was added, initially showing just "Payment".

A major addition occurred at 12:02 AM on April 25th to `Payment.js`, introducing a detailed payment summary UI. This section includes options for full or partial payments, various payment methods (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, and Stripe), and a wallet balance display, with the display of coupon and terms and conditions. This suggests the development of a fully functional payment flow was added.

The final commits to `CreateProject.js` after 11:44 PM only include minor adjustments, suggesting the main functionality and UI are finalized, and the  `Payment` component is integrated within the broader project.  The final version of `CreateProject.js` is fully implemented. There was no further changes after 11:48 PM on April 24th, 2025, to `CreateProject.js` except the final commit at 11:48 PM which removes the commented out code.


## 1:03:58 AM
The log shows iterative changes to `Payment.js`, a React component for a payment summary page.  The majority of changes focus on styling using Tailwind CSS, progressively enhancing the UI from mobile-first design to larger screen sizes.  There's consistent use of `Image` components from `next/image`,  and several SVG icons are used throughout (`/landing-page/project/full.svg`, `/landing-page/project/partial.svg`, `/landing-page/project/visa.svg`, `/landing-page/project/paypal.svg`, `/landing-page/project/stripe.svg`, `/landing-page/project/avtar.svg`, `/landing-page/project/flag.svg`, `/landing-page/project/star.svg`, `/landing-page/project/wallet.svg`, `/landing-page/i.svg`).

Between 12:08 AM and 12:16 AM, the primary modifications involved adding payment method options (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, Paypal, Stripe), refining the layout and adding image placeholders.  The initial versions lacked crucial elements like the "Confirm Payment" button and comprehensive styling.

From 12:16 AM onwards, the focus shifts to improving the visual presentation.  Changes include adjusting font sizes (`text-[18px]`, `text-[23px]`, `text-[14px]`), adding rounded corners (`rounded-[20px]`, `rounded-full`), modifying background and border colors (`bg-purple-50`, `border-[#A414D5]`, `bg-[#381F32]`), and updating the component's overall styling with Tailwind classes.  The image paths are also standardized under the `/landing-page/project/` directory.  Specifically, the avatar image source was changed from `/expert-avatar.jpg` to `/landing-page/project/avtar.svg`.

Around 12:53 AM, significant changes were introduced.  The `useRef` hook and additional state variables (`showPartialInfo`, `showProcessingInfo`, `showCouponInfo`) were added to manage the visibility of informational tooltips. These tooltips provide more details on processing fees and coupon codes, improving user understanding. The position of the tooltips (`absolute right-0` initially, then adjusting position to `right-4` then `right-8`) was also adjusted for better visual placement. The styling was further refined to better match design specifications. This is evident in the adjustments made to `text` and `bg` colors, font sizes and weights and addition of `gap` and classes like `justify-center`. Finally, a minor change was implemented in the last commit at 12:56 AM by adding a `useRef` to `processingInfoRef` that was previously commented out.  A similar `useRef` was applied to the coupon information tooltip.

In summary, the development process followed a pattern of adding core functionality first, followed by iterative styling and UI enhancements, culminating in the addition of interactive tooltips for clarifying payment details.  The consistent use of SVG icons suggests a design preference for scalability and maintainability.


## 10:41:19 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `Payment.js`, a React component for a payment summary page.  The core functionality remains consistent throughoutâ€”offering full and partial payment options with various payment methods (Visa/Mastercard/Discover, PayPal, Stripe) and displaying a payment summary.  The major changes revolve around styling and the implementation of tooltips using hover effects and ref objects.

Early revisions (1:04 AM - 1:09 AM) focus primarily on styling using Tailwind CSS, adjusting component layout (flexbox), colors, fonts, sizes, and spacing  for responsiveness across different screen sizes.  There are many incremental changes in this period.

Between 1:17 AM and 1:27 AM, a tick icon was added to the expert information section, suggesting an update to indicate expert verification or approval. Concurrently, there was significant refactoring; the `paymentType` state initially defaulted to 'full' and was changed to `false`, and  the inline styling for partial payment info was removed and replaced with conditional rendering of a tooltip triggered by a question mark icon.  The tooltip containing partial payment details is moved to an absolute positioned `div` to avoid layout disruption.

Further refinements (1:29 AM - 1:50 AM) include adjustments to the tooltip positioning and styling, shifting the tooltip's position using `left` and `top` properties  to better align it with the question mark icon. The `top` value is repeatedly adjusted in multiple commits.  The styling of the info icons and tooltips are tweaked, including changes to border styles, rounding, and font sizes.

Finally, at 1:50 AM the code is tidied up to use more concise syntax and improve readability, as well as changing the border-radius value from `20px` to `16px`. The final commit at 9:45 AM shows the component completely commented out, indicating it might have been removed or temporarily disabled.


## 12:41:11 PM
The code changes reflect the development of a payment and file upload system for a project platform.  The most significant updates occurred between 12:37 PM and 12:39 PM on April 25th, 2025.

`ProjectDetails.js`: This component was updated to include a modal for file uploads (`UploadFiles` component) triggered by clicking "Attach a File".  The design includes styling for different screen sizes (using Tailwind CSS classes), placeholders for user input (subject area, project type), and display of project details including deadline, word count, and an "Express Project" section.  A chat section is also incorporated, displaying a list of users with their details and messages.  Finally, an "Invite Tutors" section with a link encourages user interaction.

`UploadFiles.js`: This component implements a file upload functionality with features such as tab navigation ("All", "Your Files", "Writer's File"), sorting options, file removal, and a display of uploaded files with their names, sizes, upload times and a download button.  A filter modal allows users to sort by different file types ("All Files", "Documents", "Images", "Video"). The design utilizes a responsive layout that adjusts based on screen size, ensuring optimal user experience across devices.

`Payment.js`: This component manages payment options (full or partial) and methods (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, Stripe), providing summaries of payment details including expert fees, processing fees, and any applied discounts.  Tooltips provide further information about partial payments, processing fees, and coupon codes.  The component displays expert details (name, rating, reviews, project) and handles the display logic for various information panels using state variables and refs to control their visibility.  The design utilizes Tailwind CSS classes extensively for responsive layout and styling.


A recurring element across all files is the extensive use of Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.  Many UI elements are consistent, using the same icons and visual styles for buttons, inputs, and modal components.  The `Image` component from `next/image` is heavily utilized for displaying icons and images throughout the application.


## 1:41:10 PM
The log shows modifications to two files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project.  The primary changes revolve around the `invite-expert` page and its associated components.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\invite-expert\page.jsx` was modified three times on April 25th, 2025.  The first two edits (12:44:34 PM and 12:45:12 PM) appear to be nearly identical, suggesting a possible accidental save or a minor, insignificant change that was quickly reverted.  The third edit (12:46:57 PM) represents a more substantial change: the component `ChooseExpert` was replaced with `InviteTutors`. This indicates a likely refactoring or a switch to a different component for handling tutor invitations.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\ProjectDetails.js` was modified once on April 25th, 2025, at 12:45:40 PM. This update involved adding an `onClick` handler to the "Attach a File" link, opening a modal (`UploadFiles`) component for file uploads.  The `ProjectDetails` component also received numerous styling and structural changes, adding features like expandable sections, chat functionality, and a call to action to invite tutors, creating a more comprehensive project details page.  The changes in this file are largely focused on enhancing the user interface and functionality for managing project details.  There is a consistent use of SVG icons for visual elements.


## 1:50:49 PM
The log shows numerous code changes across various files in a React frontend and Node.js backend application.  The updates primarily focus on order management, user authentication, and file handling.

**`Login.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:03:19 PM):**  This component was significantly refactored.  The initial commented-out code represents an earlier version.  The updated code improves the login form's functionality.  Key changes include:  handling different account types after successful login (redirecting based on `accountType`), simplifying the state management for password visibility, and removal of commented-out code.

**`Sidebar.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:03:47 PM):**  The sidebar component was updated to dynamically render menu items based on the user's account type stored in localStorage.  The component now includes a logout functionality and uses icons from `lucide-react`.  A substantial change involved adding a `setActiveMenuItem` prop and using `useEffect` to update the active menu item based on the current location. The commented-out code is the previous version of the component.

**`UserManagement.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:04:53 PM):** This page was created to manage users. It allows for the addition and editing of users, including their roles, status, and passwords.  Pagination was implemented to handle large user lists.  The code uses `axios` for API calls and includes various UI elements for filtering and searching users.

**`ViewOrderDetails.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:05:50 PM and 1:12:56 PM):** This modal displays order details. The initial commented-out code was replaced with a functional component that fetches and displays order details, including images and CAD files. A key difference between the two versions is the replacement of `displayUsers` state with `cutoutUsers` and the associated modifications to API calls to reflect the change in naming for the `Cutout` user type. All the code was commented out in the final version.


**`OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:06:31 PM, 1:11:03 PM, 1:14:55 PM, 1:26:50 PM, 1:37:12 PM, 1:37:46 PM, 1:38:27 PM, 1:38:49 PM, 1:39:13 PM, 1:39:25 PM, 1:43:22 PM, 1:43:53 PM, 1:44:08 PM, 1:45:18 PM, 1:46:25 PM):** This modal underwent numerous iterations.  The changes consistently involved refining the logic for fetching file data, assigning orders to `Cutout` users (replacing `display` with `cutout` throughout the code), handling file downloads, and improving error handling. The API endpoints used in `axios` calls were modified to align with `cutout` user type.  The modal displays order details, including images, customer information, and requirements.  It also handles assigning orders to Cutout users via API calls to `/api/v1/admin/cutout/assignOrder/`.


**`UserModal.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:08:41 PM and 1:09:56 PM):**  This modal is used to add or edit users.  The two versions show minor changes in the code structure and styling, and the usage of `react-toastify` for displaying toast messages.


**`display.controller.js` (4/25/2025, 1:10:37 PM, 1:10:54 PM, 1:14:43 PM, 1:15:15 PM, 1:15:46 PM, 1:17:10 PM, 1:17:20 PM):**  This backend controller handles order assignments and status changes.  The numerous updates mainly focused on correcting naming inconsistencies (replacing "display" with "cutout"), improving error handling, and adding logging for changes made to orders. A significant change involved incorporating a notification system using socket.io to inform the assigned user of their new order assignment.  The controller also manages the downloading of CAD files either individually or as a zip archive.

**`admin.routes.js` (4/25/2025, 1:23:49 PM and 1:24:23 PM and 1:26:43 PM and 1:28:02 PM):**  This file defines backend routes for various admin functions, including order management, user management, and lead management. The key changes are related to consistently using `cutoutController` instead of `displayController` for routes associated with Cutout user assignments and file downloads.

**`order.controller.js` (4/25/2025, 1:24:51 PM):** This controller manages order-related operations.  The most significant update was improving the `updateOrder` function to track and log changes made to order details (requirements, dimensions, assignedTo, status, images), instead of only logging status changes.


**`ViewOrderDetails.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:25:39 PM):** This component displays order details in a modal.  It includes tabs for different sections of information and a simplified UI structure.  The code is much cleaner and removes some unnecessary state variables like `downloadingFile` and `assignLoading`, `assignError`, `assignSuccess` and others.



**`App.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:19:52 PM, 1:21:35 PM, 1:30:25 PM):** The main application routing component was updated to include routes for different user roles and pages.  The most significant changes involve consistently updating the routing for `Cutout` orders, switching from `/display-order` to `/cutout-order`.

**`Sidebar.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:30:51 PM):** The sidebar's styling and menu items were modified. The sidebar now uses a gradient background for active menu items and has a cleaner structure.  The "Work Queue" and "Financial" items were removed for certain roles, and it now explicitly handles the `Cutout` role for route `/cutout-order`.

**`Dashboard.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:32:00 PM):**  This page displays dashboard statistics (users, orders, customers). It fetches data from different API endpoints.

**`login.css` (4/25/2025, 1:32:12 PM):** Styles for the login page carousel were added or modified.


**`CutoutOrder.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:33:37 PM, 1:34:51 PM, 1:34:58 PM, 1:48:13 PM):** This page displays orders for Cutout users. The component is very similar to `DisplayOrder.jsx` the main change was the consistent use of `/cutout` endpoint for file downloads and status updates. The component name was changed to `CutoutOrders` and the page title changed to `Cutout Orders`.


**`CutoutOrderDetailsModal.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:34:36 PM):** This modal displays details of a specific order for Cutout users and offers functionality to mark orders as reviewed using a dedicated API endpoint.  The structure of this modal is improved with the introduction of  `FileDownloadManager`, `CadFilesSection` and `ImagesSection` components for improved code organization.

**`GraphicsOrder.jsx` (4/25/2025, 1:29:47 PM):** This component displays orders specifically for graphics users, enabling them to manage and update order statuses.  It incorporates pagination and handles file uploads via modals.


The consistent renaming from "display" to "cutout" indicates a likely change in terminology or a reorganization of user roles within the application. The addition of logging and notification features reflects an effort to improve transparency and communication within the application.  The numerous updates to the frontend and backend controllers show a focus on refining functionality and enhancing the user experience.


## 2:41:10 PM
The `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\page.jsx` file was updated on 4/25/2025, 2:07:34 PM.  This update significantly revised the Homework component.  The changes involve implementing smooth scrolling functionality to different sections of the page using IntersectionObserver and refs.  A sidebar navigation was added, providing buttons to navigate to sections ("How It Works," "Find an Expert," "Featured," "Claim Offers," "FAQs").  These buttons dynamically change their style based on the currently visible section. The component conditionally renders a different navigation bar (`CommunityNavbar` or `LandingNavbar`) depending on the authentication state. The component also includes several other components from the `@/components/landingPage` directory, such as `HomeworkBanner`, `TrustHomework`, `HowItWorks`, `ReachoutExperts`, `StudyBay`, `FAQHomework`, `Footer`, `ClaimOffer`, and `ReviewsCarousel`.  The core functionality added is the dynamic updating of the active section and smooth scrolling to that section via the sidebar.


## 2:50:28 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the React frontend of a project called METAL.  The majority of changes center around `ViewOrderDetails.jsx`, which displays order details.  These changes, occurring between 1:51 PM and 1:55 PM, involved refining the `fetchCutoutUsers` function.  Initially, it fetched "display users," then this was changed to fetch "cutout users,"  and the variable name was updated from `setSelectedDisplayUser` to `setSelectedCutoutUser` to reflect this change. The error message in `fetchCutoutUsers` was also improved for better clarity.  No functional changes appear in the other edits to  `ViewOrderDetails.jsx`.

Between 1:57 PM and 1:59 PM, `SignUp.jsx` was updated to include additional account types in the signup form's account type dropdown, now offering Admin, SuperAdmin, Graphics, Accounts, Display, and Cutout options.

At 1:57 PM, `UserManagement.jsx` was updated, this component likely for managing users.  The update includes enhancements to user filtering (search, role, and status filtering), pagination, and improved user status toggling with confirmation prompts before activating or deactivating accounts. There's also improved handling for adding and editing users.

At 1:58 PM, `DisplayOrders.jsx` received updates improving the display of orders.  Enhancements were made to image preview functionality (handling multiple images and loading states), and order details modal. A pagination component was added to improve usability.


Finally,  `App.jsx` was updated at 1:59 PM and 2:05 PM. The most significant change was correcting a routing issue. The path for displaying orders was changed from `/view-order` to `/display-order`  in the routing configuration. This aligns the route with the actual component name.  The sidebar component (`Sidebar.jsx`) was also updated  at 1:59 PM to include a logout functionality and to improve its responsiveness.


## 3:41:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React components: `CreateProject.js` and `Payment.js`.  `CreateProject.js` underwent several edits between 2:56 PM and 2:59 PM on April 25th, 2025, with no discernible pattern in the changes beyond minor formatting adjustments.  The code appears to be a landing page for creating projects, featuring tabs, a hero banner, and a section detailing the project creation process.

The `Payment.js` component, however, saw far more extensive modification throughout the afternoon of April 25th, 2025, from 3:03 PM to 3:40 PM.  These changes primarily focused on improving the responsiveness and visual aspects of the payment summary section.  There's a clear focus on using Tailwind CSS for styling.  Specific changes included adjustments to text sizes (`text-[16px]`, `md:text-[18px]`, etc.) across various screen sizes,  improving the layout with responsive classes (`flex flex-col md:flex-row`), and adding interactive elements such as tooltips (`onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`) to explain processing fees and coupon codes. The component displays expert information, payment options (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, Stripe), and a payment summary including processing fees and discounts.  Many changes involved refining the size and placement of images.  The overall pattern indicates a refinement process to enhance the user interface and user experience, particularly for different screen sizes.
