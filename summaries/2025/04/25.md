# Activity Summary for 4/25/2025

## 12:03:56 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to the `CreateProject.js` component  between 11:09 PM and 11:48 PM on April 24th, 2025, and further updates on April 25th, 2025.  The majority of the changes seem focused on UI refinements and the addition of a payment summary section.

Initially, `CreateProject.js` was primarily commented-out code representing a landing page component with tabs, a hero banner, and sections describing project creation.  The uncommented portion was a very basic structure.  Over several minutes,  significant portions were progressively uncommented and refined with increasingly detailed styling using Tailwind CSS classes. The commented-out code was completely removed in the final revision.


Between 11:09 PM and 11:25 PM, multiple commits show iterative changes to the styling and layout of the landing page elements. The changes are incremental, suggesting a process of continuous refinement and adjustment. The component eventually included interactive tabs, a hero banner with an image, and a "It's So Easy" section with card components.


At 11:54 PM on April 24th, a new file, `src\app\projects\payment\page.jsx`, was added. This file uses the `CreateProject` component.  Then at 11:54 PM, a `Payment.js` component was added, initially showing just "Payment".

A major addition occurred at 12:02 AM on April 25th to `Payment.js`, introducing a detailed payment summary UI. This section includes options for full or partial payments, various payment methods (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, and Stripe), and a wallet balance display, with the display of coupon and terms and conditions. This suggests the development of a fully functional payment flow was added.

The final commits to `CreateProject.js` after 11:44 PM only include minor adjustments, suggesting the main functionality and UI are finalized, and the  `Payment` component is integrated within the broader project.  The final version of `CreateProject.js` is fully implemented. There was no further changes after 11:48 PM on April 24th, 2025, to `CreateProject.js` except the final commit at 11:48 PM which removes the commented out code.

The log shows iterative changes to `Payment.js`, a React component for a payment summary page.  The majority of changes focus on styling using Tailwind CSS, progressively enhancing the UI from mobile-first design to larger screen sizes.  There's consistent use of `Image` components from `next/image`,  and several SVG icons are used throughout (`/landing-page/project/full.svg`, `/landing-page/project/partial.svg`, `/landing-page/project/visa.svg`, `/landing-page/project/paypal.svg`, `/landing-page/project/stripe.svg`, `/landing-page/project/avtar.svg`, `/landing-page/project/flag.svg`, `/landing-page/project/star.svg`, `/landing-page/project/wallet.svg`, `/landing-page/i.svg`).

Between 12:08 AM and 12:16 AM, the primary modifications involved adding payment method options (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, Paypal, Stripe), refining the layout and adding image placeholders.  The initial versions lacked crucial elements like the "Confirm Payment" button and comprehensive styling.

From 12:16 AM onwards, the focus shifts to improving the visual presentation.  Changes include adjusting font sizes (`text-[18px]`, `text-[23px]`, `text-[14px]`), adding rounded corners (`rounded-[20px]`, `rounded-full`), modifying background and border colors (`bg-purple-50`, `border-[#A414D5]`, `bg-[#381F32]`), and updating the component's overall styling with Tailwind classes.  The image paths are also standardized under the `/landing-page/project/` directory.  Specifically, the avatar image source was changed from `/expert-avatar.jpg` to `/landing-page/project/avtar.svg`.

Around 12:53 AM, significant changes were introduced.  The `useRef` hook and additional state variables (`showPartialInfo`, `showProcessingInfo`, `showCouponInfo`) were added to manage the visibility of informational tooltips. These tooltips provide more details on processing fees and coupon codes, improving user understanding. The position of the tooltips (`absolute right-0` initially, then adjusting position to `right-4` then `right-8`) was also adjusted for better visual placement. The styling was further refined to better match design specifications. This is evident in the adjustments made to `text` and `bg` colors, font sizes and weights and addition of `gap` and classes like `justify-center`. Finally, a minor change was implemented in the last commit at 12:56 AM by adding a `useRef` to `processingInfoRef` that was previously commented out.  A similar `useRef` was applied to the coupon information tooltip.

In summary, the development process followed a pattern of adding core functionality first, followed by iterative styling and UI enhancements, culminating in the addition of interactive tooltips for clarifying payment details.  The consistent use of SVG icons suggests a design preference for scalability and maintainability.

The log shows numerous revisions to `Payment.js`, a React component for a payment summary page.  The core functionality remains consistent throughoutâ€”offering full and partial payment options with various payment methods (Visa/Mastercard/Discover, PayPal, Stripe) and displaying a payment summary.  The major changes revolve around styling and the implementation of tooltips using hover effects and ref objects.

Early revisions (1:04 AM - 1:09 AM) focus primarily on styling using Tailwind CSS, adjusting component layout (flexbox), colors, fonts, sizes, and spacing  for responsiveness across different screen sizes.  There are many incremental changes in this period.

Between 1:17 AM and 1:27 AM, a tick icon was added to the expert information section, suggesting an update to indicate expert verification or approval. Concurrently, there was significant refactoring; the `paymentType` state initially defaulted to 'full' and was changed to `false`, and  the inline styling for partial payment info was removed and replaced with conditional rendering of a tooltip triggered by a question mark icon.  The tooltip containing partial payment details is moved to an absolute positioned `div` to avoid layout disruption.

Further refinements (1:29 AM - 1:50 AM) include adjustments to the tooltip positioning and styling, shifting the tooltip's position using `left` and `top` properties  to better align it with the question mark icon. The `top` value is repeatedly adjusted in multiple commits.  The styling of the info icons and tooltips are tweaked, including changes to border styles, rounding, and font sizes.

Finally, at 1:50 AM the code is tidied up to use more concise syntax and improve readability, as well as changing the border-radius value from `20px` to `16px`. The final commit at 9:45 AM shows the component completely commented out, indicating it might have been removed or temporarily disabled.


## 12:41:11 PM
The code changes reflect the development of a payment and file upload system for a project platform.  The most significant updates occurred between 12:37 PM and 12:39 PM on April 25th, 2025.

`ProjectDetails.js`: This component was updated to include a modal for file uploads (`UploadFiles` component) triggered by clicking "Attach a File".  The design includes styling for different screen sizes (using Tailwind CSS classes), placeholders for user input (subject area, project type), and display of project details including deadline, word count, and an "Express Project" section.  A chat section is also incorporated, displaying a list of users with their details and messages.  Finally, an "Invite Tutors" section with a link encourages user interaction.

`UploadFiles.js`: This component implements a file upload functionality with features such as tab navigation ("All", "Your Files", "Writer's File"), sorting options, file removal, and a display of uploaded files with their names, sizes, upload times and a download button.  A filter modal allows users to sort by different file types ("All Files", "Documents", "Images", "Video"). The design utilizes a responsive layout that adjusts based on screen size, ensuring optimal user experience across devices.

`Payment.js`: This component manages payment options (full or partial) and methods (Visa/MasterCard/Discover, PayPal, Stripe), providing summaries of payment details including expert fees, processing fees, and any applied discounts.  Tooltips provide further information about partial payments, processing fees, and coupon codes.  The component displays expert details (name, rating, reviews, project) and handles the display logic for various information panels using state variables and refs to control their visibility.  The design utilizes Tailwind CSS classes extensively for responsive layout and styling.


A recurring element across all files is the extensive use of Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.  Many UI elements are consistent, using the same icons and visual styles for buttons, inputs, and modal components.  The `Image` component from `next/image` is heavily utilized for displaying icons and images throughout the application.


## 1:41:10 PM
The log shows modifications to two files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project.  The primary changes revolve around the `invite-expert` page and its associated components.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\invite-expert\page.jsx` was modified three times on April 25th, 2025.  The first two edits (12:44:34 PM and 12:45:12 PM) appear to be nearly identical, suggesting a possible accidental save or a minor, insignificant change that was quickly reverted.  The third edit (12:46:57 PM) represents a more substantial change: the component `ChooseExpert` was replaced with `InviteTutors`. This indicates a likely refactoring or a switch to a different component for handling tutor invitations.

The file `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\ProjectDetails.js` was modified once on April 25th, 2025, at 12:45:40 PM. This update involved adding an `onClick` handler to the "Attach a File" link, opening a modal (`UploadFiles`) component for file uploads.  The `ProjectDetails` component also received numerous styling and structural changes, adding features like expandable sections, chat functionality, and a call to action to invite tutors, creating a more comprehensive project details page.  The changes in this file are largely focused on enhancing the user interface and functionality for managing project details.  There is a consistent use of SVG icons for visual elements.
