# Activity Summary for 4/9/2025

## 12:13:53 AM
The log shows several code modifications across three files: `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx`, and `App.jsx`, all within a short time frame on April 8th and 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on UI enhancements, routing, and adding features related to order details and a sidebar navigation menu.

**`OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component underwent several revisions, all occurring between 11:21 PM and 11:44 PM on April 8th, 2025.  There were no functional changes in the code during these revisions.  The code consistently displays order details, including order ID, customer information, status, assigned personnel, requirements, and associated files and images.  The `downloadFile` function handles downloading files using fetch requests with authorization headers. The status of the order is displayed with a color-coded system determined by the `getStatusColor` function.

**`Sidebar.jsx` (Two Revisions):** This file was modified twice on April 9th, 2025, around midnight. The changes are related to the navigation menu. The first revision shows a basic navigation structure for different user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts), each having a different set of menu items. The second revision changes the name of one menu item from "OrdersDisplay" to "OrdersDisplay".  No functional changes in the code were made between these revisions.

**`App.jsx` (Three Revisions):** This file, containing the main application routing, was updated three times on April 9th, 2025, around midnight.  The key updates involve integrating the `Sidebar` component into the application layout. The revisions show improvements in how the sidebar is handled, especially for responsiveness on mobile devices.  Initially, a basic sidebar was integrated, followed by updates to handle sidebar closing on mobile screens when clicking outside.  The final version added `SocketProvider`, `GraphicsOrder`, and `DisplayOrder` to the routes, suggesting integration of real-time features and additional order management pages.


## 4:09:24 AM
The log shows several code changes across frontend and backend components of a system likely managing orders and associated files.  The frontend changes primarily involve `DisplayOrder.jsx` and `DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx`, focusing on UI enhancements and order status updates.  Multiple edits to `DisplayOrder.jsx` between 12:37 AM and 12:54 AM suggest iterative development or bug fixes.  These edits appear to be commented-out code, indicating potential experimentation or temporary removal of features.


`DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx` (12:50:52 AM) introduces a modal for detailed order views, including customer information, requirements, and image previews. The code uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), fetches data from an API (`/api/v1/display`),  and handles image previews and file downloads. File download functionality is consistent between `DisplayOrder.jsx` and `DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx`, suggesting a reusable function. Status updates are implemented via a callback (`onStatusUpdate`).


The backend changes are concentrated in `auth.js` (multiple updates between 12:55 AM and 1:07 AM) and `admin.routes.js` (updated at 12:57 AM and 1:08 AM).  `auth.js` introduces authentication and authorization middleware functions (`auth`, `isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isAccount`, `isGraphics`, `isDisplay`, and `isGraphicsDisplay`).  These functions verify user roles ("Admin", "SuperAdmin", "Accounts", "Graphics", "Display") before granting access to protected routes. Note the addition of `isGraphicsDisplay` middleware, combining authorization for both Graphics and Display roles.


`admin.routes.js` defines API routes using Express.js. The changes show the addition of several routes handling orders, leads, and customers; including functionalities for creation, updates, deletion, retrieval, and order assignment.  Several routes are added for file management, specifically `downloadAllFiles` and `downloadAllFilesOfType`, suggesting improvements to file download capabilities. Notably, the `/assigned` route now uses the new `isGraphicsDisplay` middleware. This indicates a change in access control, allowing both Graphics and Display users to access assigned orders. There's also a consistent pattern of using `auth` middleware in all routes, enforcing authentication.  The use of `multer` and Cloudinary's `storage` suggests integration with cloud storage for file uploads.


## 11:48:06 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `WelcomePage.js` and one revision to `TrustHomework.js`.  The `WelcomePage.js` file underwent significant styling changes and some content modifications between 10:48 AM and 11:14 AM.  Initially,  it contained a large, complex form with sections for title, content, file attachment, type, subject, word count, deadline, and budget.  Between 10:48 AM and 10:52 AM no changes were made to the code, only the prepay percentage was changed from 30% to 50%.  Then, between 10:52 AM and 11:09 AM there were no changes. At 11:09 AM the entire content of `WelcomePage.js` was commented out. This was followed by another commit at 11:13 AM where the entire code remained commented out. Finally at 11:14 AM the code was fully rewritten with a much simpler layout and reduced content, focusing mainly on the title, content, file attachment, type, subject, word count, and deadline. The styling was also heavily revised, using more concise class names.  The final version at 11:31 AM maintains this simplified structure.  A key change is the introduction of a pre-populated file name ("document01.pdf") and date ("2024-12-19T09:00:00") at 11:14 AM. Between 11:14 AM and 11:15 AM there were only minor changes to the code, primarily removing some commented-out sections.

The `TrustHomework.js` file, updated at 11:20 AM and again at 11:20:43 AM, shows minor changes. The second commit at 11:20:43 AM changed `overflow-x-auto` to `overflow-y-auto` in the `Reviews Container` div. This suggests a minor adjustment to the layout of the review section, likely to handle different screen sizes more effectively.  The component displays student trust metrics and reviews from platforms such as Trustpilot, Sitejabber, and ExpertBuddy itself.  The styling is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
Finally, `ReviewCard.js` was added at 11:47 AM. It introduces a carousel of review cards, each displaying a reviewer's name, rating, platform, and a review excerpt.  The component uses `react-slick` for the carousel functionality and includes responsive design for different screen sizes. It also features an "expand/collapse" functionality for the review text.


## 1:14:28 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `ReviewCard.js` and one edit to `tailwind.config.mjs`.  The `ReviewCard.js` file underwent extensive modifications between 11:48 AM and 12:41 PM, primarily focusing on styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  Several commits involved commenting out large sections of code, suggesting experimentation and iterative refinement of the component's structure and presentation.  There was a significant change around 12:14 PM where the entire component was commented out, followed by its reintroduction with alterations.  The changes included adjustments to the size and margin of star rating icons, modification of the `ReviewCard` component's structure, and the removal or commenting out of elements like platform badges and navigation controls. The final version of `ReviewCard.js` shows a simpler layout and styling.

The `tailwind.config.mjs` file was updated once at 12:36 PM and again at 12:41 PM.  These updates don't significantly alter the configuration but show additions and adjustments to the font families (`Manrope`, `DM Sans`) and color palettes, including a `boxShadow` setting called `"custom-button"`  and responsive font sizes using view widths (vw) for mobile and fixed pixel sizes for larger screens (1440px+).  The consistent use of `text-[size]` classes in the CSS suggests a focus on precise typographic control.  The `StudyBay.js` file was modified once at 12:45PM with changes related to styling and responsive design for its carousel component. This involved changes to class names and the addition of `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `2xl` Tailwind responsive design classes.  The final version of `StudyBay.js` also shows a use of viewport width units (vw) for text sizing. The final commit for `ReviewCard.js` at 12:41 PM and the second commit for `tailwind.config.mjs` at 12:41 PM suggest a finalization of these styles after the several revisions.  There is a consistent pattern of using  `px`, `sm:px`, `md:px`, etc.  for responsive padding across many elements.
