# Activity Summary for 4/9/2025

## 12:13:53 AM
The log shows several code modifications across three files: `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx`, and `App.jsx`, all within a short time frame on April 8th and 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on UI enhancements, routing, and adding features related to order details and a sidebar navigation menu.

**`OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component underwent several revisions, all occurring between 11:21 PM and 11:44 PM on April 8th, 2025.  There were no functional changes in the code during these revisions.  The code consistently displays order details, including order ID, customer information, status, assigned personnel, requirements, and associated files and images.  The `downloadFile` function handles downloading files using fetch requests with authorization headers. The status of the order is displayed with a color-coded system determined by the `getStatusColor` function.

**`Sidebar.jsx` (Two Revisions):** This file was modified twice on April 9th, 2025, around midnight. The changes are related to the navigation menu. The first revision shows a basic navigation structure for different user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts), each having a different set of menu items. The second revision changes the name of one menu item from "OrdersDisplay" to "OrdersDisplay".  No functional changes in the code were made between these revisions.

**`App.jsx` (Three Revisions):** This file, containing the main application routing, was updated three times on April 9th, 2025, around midnight.  The key updates involve integrating the `Sidebar` component into the application layout. The revisions show improvements in how the sidebar is handled, especially for responsiveness on mobile devices.  Initially, a basic sidebar was integrated, followed by updates to handle sidebar closing on mobile screens when clicking outside.  The final version added `SocketProvider`, `GraphicsOrder`, and `DisplayOrder` to the routes, suggesting integration of real-time features and additional order management pages.


## 4:09:24 AM
The log shows several code changes across frontend and backend components of a system likely managing orders and associated files.  The frontend changes primarily involve `DisplayOrder.jsx` and `DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx`, focusing on UI enhancements and order status updates.  Multiple edits to `DisplayOrder.jsx` between 12:37 AM and 12:54 AM suggest iterative development or bug fixes.  These edits appear to be commented-out code, indicating potential experimentation or temporary removal of features.


`DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx` (12:50:52 AM) introduces a modal for detailed order views, including customer information, requirements, and image previews. The code uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), fetches data from an API (`/api/v1/display`),  and handles image previews and file downloads. File download functionality is consistent between `DisplayOrder.jsx` and `DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx`, suggesting a reusable function. Status updates are implemented via a callback (`onStatusUpdate`).


The backend changes are concentrated in `auth.js` (multiple updates between 12:55 AM and 1:07 AM) and `admin.routes.js` (updated at 12:57 AM and 1:08 AM).  `auth.js` introduces authentication and authorization middleware functions (`auth`, `isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isAccount`, `isGraphics`, `isDisplay`, and `isGraphicsDisplay`).  These functions verify user roles ("Admin", "SuperAdmin", "Accounts", "Graphics", "Display") before granting access to protected routes. Note the addition of `isGraphicsDisplay` middleware, combining authorization for both Graphics and Display roles.


`admin.routes.js` defines API routes using Express.js. The changes show the addition of several routes handling orders, leads, and customers; including functionalities for creation, updates, deletion, retrieval, and order assignment.  Several routes are added for file management, specifically `downloadAllFiles` and `downloadAllFilesOfType`, suggesting improvements to file download capabilities. Notably, the `/assigned` route now uses the new `isGraphicsDisplay` middleware. This indicates a change in access control, allowing both Graphics and Display users to access assigned orders. There's also a consistent pattern of using `auth` middleware in all routes, enforcing authentication.  The use of `multer` and Cloudinary's `storage` suggests integration with cloud storage for file uploads.


## 11:48:06 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `WelcomePage.js` and one revision to `TrustHomework.js`.  The `WelcomePage.js` file underwent significant styling changes and some content modifications between 10:48 AM and 11:14 AM.  Initially,  it contained a large, complex form with sections for title, content, file attachment, type, subject, word count, deadline, and budget.  Between 10:48 AM and 10:52 AM no changes were made to the code, only the prepay percentage was changed from 30% to 50%.  Then, between 10:52 AM and 11:09 AM there were no changes. At 11:09 AM the entire content of `WelcomePage.js` was commented out. This was followed by another commit at 11:13 AM where the entire code remained commented out. Finally at 11:14 AM the code was fully rewritten with a much simpler layout and reduced content, focusing mainly on the title, content, file attachment, type, subject, word count, and deadline. The styling was also heavily revised, using more concise class names.  The final version at 11:31 AM maintains this simplified structure.  A key change is the introduction of a pre-populated file name ("document01.pdf") and date ("2024-12-19T09:00:00") at 11:14 AM. Between 11:14 AM and 11:15 AM there were only minor changes to the code, primarily removing some commented-out sections.

The `TrustHomework.js` file, updated at 11:20 AM and again at 11:20:43 AM, shows minor changes. The second commit at 11:20:43 AM changed `overflow-x-auto` to `overflow-y-auto` in the `Reviews Container` div. This suggests a minor adjustment to the layout of the review section, likely to handle different screen sizes more effectively.  The component displays student trust metrics and reviews from platforms such as Trustpilot, Sitejabber, and ExpertBuddy itself.  The styling is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
Finally, `ReviewCard.js` was added at 11:47 AM. It introduces a carousel of review cards, each displaying a reviewer's name, rating, platform, and a review excerpt.  The component uses `react-slick` for the carousel functionality and includes responsive design for different screen sizes. It also features an "expand/collapse" functionality for the review text.


## 1:14:28 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `ReviewCard.js` and one edit to `tailwind.config.mjs`.  The `ReviewCard.js` file underwent extensive modifications between 11:48 AM and 12:41 PM, primarily focusing on styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  Several commits involved commenting out large sections of code, suggesting experimentation and iterative refinement of the component's structure and presentation.  There was a significant change around 12:14 PM where the entire component was commented out, followed by its reintroduction with alterations.  The changes included adjustments to the size and margin of star rating icons, modification of the `ReviewCard` component's structure, and the removal or commenting out of elements like platform badges and navigation controls. The final version of `ReviewCard.js` shows a simpler layout and styling.

The `tailwind.config.mjs` file was updated once at 12:36 PM and again at 12:41 PM.  These updates don't significantly alter the configuration but show additions and adjustments to the font families (`Manrope`, `DM Sans`) and color palettes, including a `boxShadow` setting called `"custom-button"`  and responsive font sizes using view widths (vw) for mobile and fixed pixel sizes for larger screens (1440px+).  The consistent use of `text-[size]` classes in the CSS suggests a focus on precise typographic control.  The `StudyBay.js` file was modified once at 12:45PM with changes related to styling and responsive design for its carousel component. This involved changes to class names and the addition of `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `2xl` Tailwind responsive design classes.  The final version of `StudyBay.js` also shows a use of viewport width units (vw) for text sizing. The final commit for `ReviewCard.js` at 12:41 PM and the second commit for `tailwind.config.mjs` at 12:41 PM suggest a finalization of these styles after the several revisions.  There is a consistent pattern of using  `px`, `sm:px`, `md:px`, etc.  for responsive padding across many elements.


## 2:14:25 PM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `TrustHomework.js` and `StudyBay.js`.  `StudyBay.js` underwent numerous revisions between 1:22 PM and 2:13 PM, primarily involving adjustments to styling (using Tailwind CSS) and minor text changes within the component's description.  These changes focused on responsiveness across different screen sizes (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl), refining text sizes, spacing, and image dimensions for a better user experience.  A significant change involved transitioning the component to a functional component using "use client" and integrating the `react-slick` library for a carousel feature.  The `FeatureCard` component also saw modifications in its styling attributes during this period.

The `TrustHomework.js` component was updated once at 1:17 PM and again at 1:41 PM. The earlier update was a comprehensive initial version. The later update similarly involved extensive styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS for better responsiveness, comparable to the changes made in `StudyBay.js`.  The primary change is the inclusion of more responsive design elements using various screen size prefixes in the className attributes.


A recurring pattern across both components is the heavy use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling and the repeated adjustments for various screen sizes, indicating a focus on responsive design.  The use of `next/image` for image handling is consistent in both components.  Both components show a progression from commented-out code towards a fully functional version.


## 3:14:17 PM
The log shows two nearly identical commits to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\DisplayOrder.jsx`, separated by 18 seconds (4/9/2025, 2:59:22 PM and 4/9/2025, 2:59:40 PM).  The code within these commits is a React component (`DisplayOrder`) responsible for displaying order details, handling status updates, and managing file downloads.  No substantive changes are visible between the two commits; they appear to be identical.  The component interacts with a backend API (indicated by `BASE_URL` and `API_PREFIX`) to fetch order data and files, using a token stored in `localStorage`.  It includes functionality for updating order status, downloading files (individually or in bulk), and displaying a preview of images.  The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS classes.  The component's state manages loading, error conditions, and download progress, providing visual feedback to the user.


## 3:14:28 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React component files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project.  The most significant changes are related to styling and responsiveness, with iterative adjustments to component sizes and text sizes across different screen sizes (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`).

`StudyBay.js`: This file, a carousel component, underwent a major revision between 2:14:47 PM and 2:15:01 PM.  The changes primarily involved refining the styling of the carousel and its components (`FeatureCard`), making it more responsive across various screen sizes.  The code changed from commented-out code to a functional component with improved responsiveness using Tailwind CSS classes.

`ReachoutExperts.js`: This component, showcasing a landing page section to contact experts, was updated at 2:19:37 PM. The update focuses on styling, improving layout with Tailwind CSS classes for responsiveness, and incorporating an image (`/landing-page/homework/expert.svg`) and icons. No functional changes are apparent.

`HomeworkBanner.js`: Modified at 2:23:09 PM, this file contains a banner component.  The key changes include the addition of a form for project description submission, a toggle for "Human experts only" (using `@mantine/core`'s Switch component), and modals for signup (`SignupModal`) and welcome messages (`WelcomeModal`) based on user authentication status (checked using a JWT token from a cookie).

`TrustHomework.js`: This file (a trust badge component)  underwent numerous revisions between 2:24:57 PM and 2:31:06 PM. These revisions were focused almost entirely on improving the responsiveness of the component's layout and text sizes, utilizing a more extensive range of Tailwind CSS classes (2xs, xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl).  The core functionality remains the same, displaying trust badges and reviews.  The final change removes extra padding.

`ReviewCard.js`: This component, showing review cards, was revised repeatedly between 2:32:34 PM and 2:53:55 PM. The significant changes involved adding more responsive design elements to the component, its parent `ReviewsCarousel`, and the `PlatformBadge` component, along with the addition of `Reviews.io` and `Review Centre` review platforms and adjustments to the `react-slick` carousel's responsive settings to handle more screen sizes effectively. The primary focus was improving the responsiveness of the layout and image sizes. The final change was an adjustment to the crown image's position.


## 4:14:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to components of a React frontend application (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).  The changes primarily focus on two files: `WelcomePage.js` and `Navbar.js`.

`WelcomePage.js` underwent several edits between 3:27 PM and 4:04 PM.  All revisions to this file consist of commented-out code, suggesting that the component is either being temporarily disabled or refactored. The commented code represents a modal component with fields for title, content, file attachment, type, subject category, subject list, word count, budget, and deadline.  There is no discernible pattern in the commenting besides the overall removal of the component's functionality.

`Navbar.js` was updated twice, at 3:34 PM and 3:55 PM. These updates involve significant changes to the Navbar component, implementing both desktop and mobile versions using React components and Next.js features.  The component handles user authentication and conditionally renders navigation items (e.g., "Sign In" changes to "Log Out" upon login).  The 3:55 PM update refactors the component name from `cNavbar` to `Navbar`.  The code uses  `react-redux`, `next/navigation`, custom UI components (e.g., `NavigationMenu`, `Sheet`), `js-cookie` for managing user sessions, and `sonner` for toast notifications.  The  `useEffect` hook fetches and validates the student profile to determine the login state and update the navigation links accordingly. A consistent pattern is the use of calculated units (`calc((X/1440)*100vw)`) for responsive design.


## 5:14:17 PM
The log shows multiple updates to React components within a frontend application, likely for managing orders.  Significant changes occurred between 4:54 PM and 5:14 PM on April 9th, 2025.

`DisplayOrder.jsx`: This component handles displaying individual order details and provides functionality for updating order status and downloading files.  The code includes extensive error handling and uses `fetch` API calls for data retrieval and status updates. The component displays order information, allows marking orders as "Completed," and provides a file download mechanism with various download options ("all," "type," "single").  It uses a status-based color coding system.

`Orders.jsx`: This component manages a list of orders, allowing for searching, filtering by status, creating new orders, editing existing orders, and deleting orders. It uses a similar status color-coding system as `DisplayOrder.jsx`.  The component features a modal for creating and editing orders and also for previewing images associated with the orders. The `fetch` API is used to retrieve and update order data.

`DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx`: This component displays detailed order information within a modal.  It shows order details, customer information, requirements, and associated files and images. There were three revisions to this file within a short timeframe.  The primary change across these revisions was a modification of the `API_PREFIX` constant in the code, which changed from `/api/v1/display` to `/api/v1/admin` and finally to `/api/v1`. This suggests a refactoring of API endpoints or a change in the API's structure.  The component allows marking orders as "Reviewed" and provides image previews and file downloads, using the `fetch` API.  The component also includes comprehensive error handling and loading indicators.  The status options ("Pending", "InProgress", "Reviewed", "Completed") are consistently used in the component.  A pattern of using Tailwind CSS classes for styling is evident throughout the code.


## 6:37:45 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `WelcomePage.js` between 5:51 PM and 6:24 PM on April 9, 2025.  The major changes involve UI enhancements and the addition of functionality:

* **Initial state (5:51 PM):** The component was a basic welcome modal with input fields for title, content, file upload, type, subject category, subject list, word count, and budget.  It used a custom date picker and SVG icons.

* **UI Improvements (5:58 PM):** No code changes were observed between 5:51 PM and 5:58 PM.

* **Subject Category/Subject Integration (6:03 PM):**  Significant changes were made to integrate subject categories and subjects.  The component now fetches subject categories from localStorage, dynamically populating subject categories and subject lists based on user selection.  Error handling was added for localStorage parsing.

* **Date Picker Enhancement (6:05 PM - 6:09 PM):** Multiple commits attempted to integrate a `@mantine/dates` DatePicker and/or DateTimePicker component to replace the custom date picker.  The final version in this series (6:09 PM) used a `DateTimePicker` providing date and time selection.  Styling was applied to customize the component's appearance.

* **Removal of DatePicker (6:13 PM, 6:14 PM, 6:15 PM):** After several attempts, the `DatePicker` and `DateTimePicker` components were removed and commented out in favor of a simpler approach using only the date component again.  The process seems to show an iterative development and testing phase of components.

* **Icon Replacement (6:17 PM - 6:18 PM):** The SVG icons for the file attachment were replaced with images from the `/landing-page/homework` directory.  Several attempts to update the image path were done.  


* **Final DateTimePicker Integration (6:22 PM - 6:24 PM):**  After several iterations, a `DateTimePicker` was integrated, finally replacing the simple date picker with both date and time selection. The approach was changed to a more simplified approach.

* **`ReviewCard.js` (6:16 PM):** A separate component `ReviewCard.js` was added, which creates a carousel of review cards. It uses `react-slick` for the carousel, displays ratings using SVG star icons based on platform-specific image paths, and provides expandable review text.  This component is independent of the `WelcomePage.js` updates and shows different improvements.

Throughout the `WelcomePage.js` edits, there's a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling, and the imports of `lucide-react` for icons and `@mantine/dates` for the date/time picker component indicate a clear design preference.  The development process demonstrates an iterative approach to component integration and UI refinement.
