# Activity Summary for 4/9/2025

## 12:13:53 AM
The log shows several code modifications across three files: `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx`, and `App.jsx`, all within a short time frame on April 8th and 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on UI enhancements, routing, and adding features related to order details and a sidebar navigation menu.

**`OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component underwent several revisions, all occurring between 11:21 PM and 11:44 PM on April 8th, 2025.  There were no functional changes in the code during these revisions.  The code consistently displays order details, including order ID, customer information, status, assigned personnel, requirements, and associated files and images.  The `downloadFile` function handles downloading files using fetch requests with authorization headers. The status of the order is displayed with a color-coded system determined by the `getStatusColor` function.

**`Sidebar.jsx` (Two Revisions):** This file was modified twice on April 9th, 2025, around midnight. The changes are related to the navigation menu. The first revision shows a basic navigation structure for different user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts), each having a different set of menu items. The second revision changes the name of one menu item from "OrdersDisplay" to "OrdersDisplay".  No functional changes in the code were made between these revisions.

**`App.jsx` (Three Revisions):** This file, containing the main application routing, was updated three times on April 9th, 2025, around midnight.  The key updates involve integrating the `Sidebar` component into the application layout. The revisions show improvements in how the sidebar is handled, especially for responsiveness on mobile devices.  Initially, a basic sidebar was integrated, followed by updates to handle sidebar closing on mobile screens when clicking outside.  The final version added `SocketProvider`, `GraphicsOrder`, and `DisplayOrder` to the routes, suggesting integration of real-time features and additional order management pages.


## 4:09:24 AM
The log shows several code changes across frontend and backend components of a system likely managing orders and associated files.  The frontend changes primarily involve `DisplayOrder.jsx` and `DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx`, focusing on UI enhancements and order status updates.  Multiple edits to `DisplayOrder.jsx` between 12:37 AM and 12:54 AM suggest iterative development or bug fixes.  These edits appear to be commented-out code, indicating potential experimentation or temporary removal of features.


`DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx` (12:50:52 AM) introduces a modal for detailed order views, including customer information, requirements, and image previews. The code uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), fetches data from an API (`/api/v1/display`),  and handles image previews and file downloads. File download functionality is consistent between `DisplayOrder.jsx` and `DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx`, suggesting a reusable function. Status updates are implemented via a callback (`onStatusUpdate`).


The backend changes are concentrated in `auth.js` (multiple updates between 12:55 AM and 1:07 AM) and `admin.routes.js` (updated at 12:57 AM and 1:08 AM).  `auth.js` introduces authentication and authorization middleware functions (`auth`, `isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isAccount`, `isGraphics`, `isDisplay`, and `isGraphicsDisplay`).  These functions verify user roles ("Admin", "SuperAdmin", "Accounts", "Graphics", "Display") before granting access to protected routes. Note the addition of `isGraphicsDisplay` middleware, combining authorization for both Graphics and Display roles.


`admin.routes.js` defines API routes using Express.js. The changes show the addition of several routes handling orders, leads, and customers; including functionalities for creation, updates, deletion, retrieval, and order assignment.  Several routes are added for file management, specifically `downloadAllFiles` and `downloadAllFilesOfType`, suggesting improvements to file download capabilities. Notably, the `/assigned` route now uses the new `isGraphicsDisplay` middleware. This indicates a change in access control, allowing both Graphics and Display users to access assigned orders. There's also a consistent pattern of using `auth` middleware in all routes, enforcing authentication.  The use of `multer` and Cloudinary's `storage` suggests integration with cloud storage for file uploads.
