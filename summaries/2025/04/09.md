# Activity Summary for 4/9/2025

## 12:13:53 AM
The log shows several code modifications across three files: `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx`, and `App.jsx`, all within a short time frame on April 8th and 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on UI enhancements, routing, and adding features related to order details and a sidebar navigation menu.

**`OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This component underwent several revisions, all occurring between 11:21 PM and 11:44 PM on April 8th, 2025.  There were no functional changes in the code during these revisions.  The code consistently displays order details, including order ID, customer information, status, assigned personnel, requirements, and associated files and images.  The `downloadFile` function handles downloading files using fetch requests with authorization headers. The status of the order is displayed with a color-coded system determined by the `getStatusColor` function.

**`Sidebar.jsx` (Two Revisions):** This file was modified twice on April 9th, 2025, around midnight. The changes are related to the navigation menu. The first revision shows a basic navigation structure for different user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts), each having a different set of menu items. The second revision changes the name of one menu item from "OrdersDisplay" to "OrdersDisplay".  No functional changes in the code were made between these revisions.

**`App.jsx` (Three Revisions):** This file, containing the main application routing, was updated three times on April 9th, 2025, around midnight.  The key updates involve integrating the `Sidebar` component into the application layout. The revisions show improvements in how the sidebar is handled, especially for responsiveness on mobile devices.  Initially, a basic sidebar was integrated, followed by updates to handle sidebar closing on mobile screens when clicking outside.  The final version added `SocketProvider`, `GraphicsOrder`, and `DisplayOrder` to the routes, suggesting integration of real-time features and additional order management pages.
