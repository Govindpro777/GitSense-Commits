# Activity Summary for 4/3/2025

## 12:36:46 AM
The log shows changes made to environment files and the frontend code of a Metal-CRM application between 11:37 PM on April 2nd, 2025 and 12:18 AM on April 3rd, 2025.

The backend `.env` file (11:37:12 PM) was updated to include MongoDB connection details, JWT secret, Cloudinary settings, and the frontend client URL.  The frontend `.env` file (11:37:06 PM) sets the base URL for the application.

The `Orders.jsx` component underwent multiple revisions (11:45:00 PM, 11:47:25 PM, 11:48:51 PM, 11:51:07 PM, 11:51:45 PM, 11:52:03 PM, and 11:54:27 PM).  Initially, it fetched and displayed order data,  including features for creating, editing, deleting, searching, filtering by status, and previewing images.  The image preview functionality was initially flawed and went through several iterations to correctly handle multiple images. Ultimately the `Orders.jsx` file was completely deleted at 11:54:27 PM.

The `EditOrder.jsx` component also saw multiple changes (12:01:04 AM, 12:07:01 AM, and 12:08:34 AM), progressing from a basic form for editing order details to a more robust version that manages image uploads and previews.  The final version (12:08:34 AM) includes functionality for previewing images before updating an order. The file started with commented-out code then  became fully functional with image preview.

The `CreateNewOrder.jsx` component went through a similar evolution (12:06:45 AM),  starting as commented-out code, eventually becoming a functional component for creating new orders with image uploads. This also was changed from a basic form to support multiple image uploads.

The `Sidebar.jsx` component (12:18:10 AM and 12:18:25 AM) was created to provide navigation within the application.  It dynamically generates menu items based on user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts), showing relevant options for each role. The only change was the removing of the gallery option for Admin users.


There is a clear pattern of iterative development, with frequent updates to the frontend components (`Orders.jsx`, `EditOrder.jsx`, `CreateNewOrder.jsx`) reflecting incremental improvements and bug fixes.  The use of `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` consistently demonstrates the use of environment variables throughout the frontend code.  The use of `localStorage` for storing authentication tokens is also consistent across all files.


## 9:39:06 AM
The `CreateNewOrder.jsx` component underwent modifications on April 3rd, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the component's state management and UI elements.

The first revision (8:49:47 AM) shows a functional component with extensive commented-out code, suggesting a work-in-progress state.  The code includes functionality for creating new orders, handling customer and user selection (with auto-suggestions), image uploads, and form submission.  The order creation process uses `fetch` to send a FormData object to the backend.  Error handling is implemented using a `try...catch` block.  The UI is built using a modal dialog with input fields, dropdown menus, and image preview.

The second revision (8:51:34 AM) shows that the component is still under development.  The commented-out code remains largely unchanged.  A key difference is a partial update to the `useState` hook for the `order` variable. Specifically,  `assignedToId` was removed from the  `order` state and  `customerId` was added.  The `imagePreview` state is updated to be an array rather than a single value, indicating a potential change to allow for multiple image previews.  The code suggests the developer is iterating on the state management.  The incomplete nature of the second revision implies that the development is ongoing.


## 12:39:08 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `Navbar.js` and `HomeworkBanner.js`.  The changes span approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes, between 11:50 AM and 12:24 PM on April 3rd, 2025.

`Navbar.js` underwent several revisions focused primarily on the "Homework" navigation item. Initially, this item linked to `/signin`.  Subsequent edits changed the link to an empty string (`""`) at 12:14:09 PM and then back to `/signin` at 12:22:15 PM, before finally being set to an empty string again at 12:24:02 PM. This suggests ongoing adjustments to the navigation structure and potentially its intended functionality.  The `Navbar.js` file consistently uses React components such as `Link`, `Image`, `Button`, and UI elements from a `navigation-menu` and `sheet` component library. The conditional rendering based on `isLoggedIn` state controls the display of "Sign In/Log Out" and associated UI elements.

`HomeworkBanner.js` shows one significant change at 12:20:27 PM.  This revision altered the background image of the banner from `/images/banner/top-banner.jpeg` to `/images/banner/homework-banner.svg`. This update likely aimed to improve the visual appearance of the homework banner section, potentially for a cleaner or more thematic consistency. The component uses a form with a text area to allow users to describe projects. The component also incorporates a toggle switch for human expert selection.  The height of the banner is dynamically adjusted based on authentication status.


## 1:17:13 PM
The log shows modifications to the `Home.tsx` and `Home.jsx` files, focusing on the development of a "HomeworkBanner" component.  The initial `Home.tsx` file (12:07:57 PM) contained commented-out code suggesting an earlier, more basic design.  This was likely a placeholder or an older version of the component.

Subsequent changes in `Home.jsx` (12:08:09 PM and 12:19:30 PM) indicate a significant redesign.  The component is now named `HomeworkBanner`, uses responsive design features (via Tailwind CSS), and incorporates images and interactive elements like a switch and a form.  The changes involved updating image paths, modifying styling (colors, sizes, and layout) and adding authentication logic via `useAuth` and `Cookies` to dynamically adjust the height of the banner based on the user's authentication status.  The most noticeable difference between the two `Home.jsx` versions is a change in the background image path (from `/images/banner/top-banner.jpeg` to `/images/banner/` in the final version), suggesting a potential issue or change in the image source.  Both versions kept the core functionality of a form with a project description and a human experts only toggle.  The overall development pattern is iterative, with the component's style and functionality refined over a short period.


## 1:39:06 PM
The log shows updates to three components of a React frontend application: `HomeworkPage`, `HomeworkBanner`, and `Navbar`.

On April 3rd, 2025,  `HomeworkPage` (12:42:10 PM) was minimally updated to simply render a `HomeworkBanner` component, indicating a refactoring or organization of the code.

`HomeworkBanner` (12:43:11 PM) underwent significant changes.  This component now includes a form for project description input, a toggle for "Human experts only," and uses cookies to dynamically adjust its height based on user authentication status (`jwtToken`).  The component also incorporates several images (`homework-banner.svg`, `homework-expert.png`, two instances of `Rectangle.svg`) for styling and visual appeal.  The form submits project description and human expert preference to the console (for now, presumably a placeholder for future backend interaction).

The `Navbar` component (1:19:43 PM) was substantially updated. It now includes a loading indicator (`ClipLoader`) for when the authentication status is pending.  It uses routing (`useRouter`) to redirect unauthenticated users and features several interactive elements including links to "Find Tutor" (dispatches Redux actions to filter search by English), "Homework", a display of balance (0 USD), a "Refer a Friend" button, a language/currency selector, and icons for messages, help, and notifications.  Conditional rendering based on authentication state is implemented to show different UI states.  The navbar also dynamically adjusts its sizing and uses numerous images for styling.  The "Find Tutor" link includes logic to dispatch redux actions to filter tutor searches based on subject (English).  A `ProfileMenu` component is used to render a user's profile.
