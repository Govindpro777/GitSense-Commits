# Activity Summary for 4/3/2025

## 12:36:46 AM
The log shows changes made to environment files and the frontend code of a Metal-CRM application between 11:37 PM on April 2nd, 2025 and 12:18 AM on April 3rd, 2025.

The backend `.env` file (11:37:12 PM) was updated to include MongoDB connection details, JWT secret, Cloudinary settings, and the frontend client URL.  The frontend `.env` file (11:37:06 PM) sets the base URL for the application.

The `Orders.jsx` component underwent multiple revisions (11:45:00 PM, 11:47:25 PM, 11:48:51 PM, 11:51:07 PM, 11:51:45 PM, 11:52:03 PM, and 11:54:27 PM).  Initially, it fetched and displayed order data,  including features for creating, editing, deleting, searching, filtering by status, and previewing images.  The image preview functionality was initially flawed and went through several iterations to correctly handle multiple images. Ultimately the `Orders.jsx` file was completely deleted at 11:54:27 PM.

The `EditOrder.jsx` component also saw multiple changes (12:01:04 AM, 12:07:01 AM, and 12:08:34 AM), progressing from a basic form for editing order details to a more robust version that manages image uploads and previews.  The final version (12:08:34 AM) includes functionality for previewing images before updating an order. The file started with commented-out code then  became fully functional with image preview.

The `CreateNewOrder.jsx` component went through a similar evolution (12:06:45 AM),  starting as commented-out code, eventually becoming a functional component for creating new orders with image uploads. This also was changed from a basic form to support multiple image uploads.

The `Sidebar.jsx` component (12:18:10 AM and 12:18:25 AM) was created to provide navigation within the application.  It dynamically generates menu items based on user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts), showing relevant options for each role. The only change was the removing of the gallery option for Admin users.


There is a clear pattern of iterative development, with frequent updates to the frontend components (`Orders.jsx`, `EditOrder.jsx`, `CreateNewOrder.jsx`) reflecting incremental improvements and bug fixes.  The use of `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` consistently demonstrates the use of environment variables throughout the frontend code.  The use of `localStorage` for storing authentication tokens is also consistent across all files.
