# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 12:29:56 AM
The log shows multiple edits to three React component files (`HomeworkBanner.js`, `ReviewCard.js`, `ReachoutExperts.js`) between 11:50 PM and 12:27 AM on April 13th and 14th, 2025.

`HomeworkBanner.js`: This file underwent several revisions focusing primarily on styling adjustments.  Changes included tweaking font sizes (`lg:text-[46px]` to `lg:text-[42px]`, then further adjustments to  `lg:text-[18px]`), adding and removing `mt` classes for responsiveness, and minor modifications to button margin classes (`mb-2` and `md:mt-2` adjustments). These edits suggest iterative improvements to the component's layout and responsiveness across different screen sizes.  The core functionality, including modal handling and form submission, remained consistent.


`ReviewCard.js`: This file, containing a review carousel component, remained largely unchanged. The major alteration was a small increase in the heading font size (`md:text-[34px]` to `md:text-[35px]`). The structure and functionality of the carousel, including its responsive design and navigation, were not significantly altered.


`ReachoutExperts.js`: This component shows a more substantial evolution. Initially, the file lacked styling for the overlapping features section.  Subsequent revisions added this styling, along with  minor adjustments to border sizes (`border` to `border-[#0000001A] border-t-[1.11px] border-b-[8.9px] border-l-[1.11px] border-r-[1.11px]`),  text sizes (`lg:text-[20px]` to `xl:text-[23px]`), and the addition of `divide-x-2 divide-[#0000001A]` to create visual separators between sections.  Furthermore, the width of the left content section was adjusted (`md:w-1/2` to `md:w-3/5`) and the right section (`md:w-1/2` to `md:w-2/5`), impacting the overall layout.  Some input fields also received improved styling (adding `focus` classes).  Comment sections were also added and removed at various stages showing comments being used for temporary disabling and later enabling certain sections in the code. The overall evolution points to significant improvements in the UI/UX and responsiveness of this component.


## 1:29:55 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ReachoutExperts.js`, a React component likely part of a landing page.  Changes were made between 12:30 AM and 1:29 AM on April 14th, 2025.

The primary focus of the revisions appears to be on styling and layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  Many changes involve tweaking class names to modify spacing (`pt-12`, `pb-8`, `min-h-[880px]`, `md:min-h-[750px]`, etc.),  text sizes (`text-[28px]`, `md:text-[32px]`, etc.),  and button styles (`rounded-3xl`, `rounded-[100px]`). There's also some adjustment to the `max-w` property for better responsiveness.  A box shadow was added to the "Find an Expert" button.

Around 12:49 AM, a significant restructuring occurred. The code was extensively commented out, and a new version was introduced. This new version involved improvements to responsiveness  using more semantic Tailwind classes (e.g., `text-H4`, `text-P3`) and a change in the image used on the right-hand side (`/landing-page/expert-side.svg` replacing `/landing-page/homework/expert.svg`). The button text changed from "Find an Expert" to "Let's Get Started."

After 1:20 AM, further adjustments to text sizes within headings and paragraphs are observed, along with minor refinements to the image's max width and height and the  `-mt` (margin-top) adjustments for the features section.  The overall pattern indicates iterative refinements to achieve optimal visual presentation across different screen sizes.  The commented-out section suggests an attempt to preserve the earlier version for potential future reference.  The commented out section and the final version suggest a shift in design approach.


## 10:41:26 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `ReachoutExperts.js` and several edits to `StudyBay.js` and `ClaimOffer.js`.  The changes to `ReachoutExperts.js` primarily involve adjustments to the styling and positioning of elements within the component, specifically the `Image` components and their respective class names. These adjustments span a period from 1:58 AM to 2:20 AM.  The changes are iterative, with small modifications to positioning values (`-left-4`, `-left-6`, `-left-10`, `-left-12`, etc.) across multiple commits.  There's also one change impacting the `expert.svg` Image's dimensions, gradually reducing the width from an extremely large value (4210px) to 420px.  The `z-index` property of a div containing the expert image is also modified from 3 to 30.

The `StudyBay.js` file shows changes between 2:22 AM and 2:26 AM, primarily adjusting the size of the crown image within the `ExpertBuddyCarousel` component across different screen sizes.

The `ClaimOffer.js` file undergoes changes between 9:51 AM and 10:22 AM. The updates involve adding margin and padding values (`mt-`, `md:p-10`, `md:pt-10`) and adjusting text sizes (`text-[16px]`, `text-[18px]`, `text-[28px]`, `text-[35px]`). The size of the "Susan White" text is increased and a box shadow is added to the button.  The modifications are made in a relatively short timespan, and are not iterative in the same manner as those in `ReachoutExperts.js`.  A recurring theme across all three files is the use of responsive design techniques using Tailwind CSS (`xs:`, `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`).


## 11:41:18 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ClaimOffer.js` on April 14th, 2025, between 11:02 AM and 11:38 AM.  The changes primarily involve adjustments to styling using Tailwind CSS classes.  Specific modifications include altering text sizes (`text-[...]`) across different screen sizes (using `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` prefixes) for headings (h1, h2) and paragraphs (p).  There are also minor adjustments to margins (`mt-`, `mb-`, `ml-`, `pr-`), padding (`p-`, `px-`, `py-`), and heights (`max-h-`, `h-`). One notable change involves increasing the height of the phone input field (`lg:h-[60px]`) and the size of the flag image  (`lg:w-[28px] lg:h-[28px]`).  The overall pattern suggests iterative refinements to the component's responsiveness and visual appeal across various screen sizes.  The core functionality of the component (displaying an offer and collecting a phone number) remained unchanged throughout these revisions.  There is also a single log entry for `WelcomePage.js` at 11:27:02 AM,  which shows a significant code block containing state management, API calls (using axiosInstance), file upload functionality, and UI elements. This component appears to handle the creation of a new homework assignment.


## 12:41:20 PM
The log shows numerous modifications to `ClaimOffer.js` between 12:24 PM and 12:41 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes primarily involve adjustments to the styling and font sizes of various elements within the React component.  There's no change in the core functionality; the component continues to accept a phone number and offer a discount.

Specifically, the edits focus on the input field and the country flag image within the phone number input section. The font size of the input field (`text-[14px]`, `text-[18px]`, etc.) and the flag image size (`w-[24px]`, `w-[28px]`, etc.) are repeatedly modified.  Several edits seem to be focused on fine-tuning responsiveness based on screen size (using Tailwind CSS classes like `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).  The changes are incremental, with small adjustments to the margin and text sizes made across multiple commits.  There's no significant structural change to the component's layout.


## 2:51:26 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to three React component files: `ClaimOffer.js`, `How-It-Works.js`, and `HomeworkBanner.js`.  The changes span approximately an hour, from 12:42 PM to 2:51 PM.


**`ClaimOffer.js` Changes:**

Two revisions occurred within a minute of each other (12:42 PM and 12:43 PM). The primary change was the un-commenting of a section of code containing a phone number input field with country code selection.  This suggests an initial version omitted the input field, which was later added. A minor change in version 2:49 PM was made to the input field's styling by adding a `max-width` to the input's container. A final update at 2:50PM changed the text size of the country code from `14px` to `17px` for better readability.


**`How-It-Works.js` Changes:**

This file underwent significant restructuring and styling adjustments between 1:55 PM and 2:42 PM.  Multiple revisions focused on:

* **Layout:** The component's layout shifted from a vertical to a horizontal arrangement (for medium-sized screens and above) to improve visual appeal and information organization.
* **Image placement:** Images were repositioned for better visual balance and responsiveness.
* **Line separators:**  The separator images (`/landing-page/line1.svg`, and `/landing-page/line2.svg`) were repeatedly added, removed, and their styling adjusted across various revisions.  This indicates experimentation with visual flow and separation of sections. The final version only includes `line1.svg`.
* **Styling consistency:** Multiple edits adjusted font sizes, padding, margins, and class names for better responsiveness and design cohesion. The component's overall height was changed to `min-h-screen`.
* **Component simplification:**  The final edit at 2:42 PM streamlined the code by removing redundant styling and improving the structure of the component's sections to increase readability and maintainability.


**`HomeworkBanner.js` Changes:**

This file shows numerous small changes between 2:13 PM and 2:51 PM.  These revisions mainly focused on refining the styling and positioning of elements within the banner:

* **Margin adjustments:**  The `mt` (margin-top) values for the left content section were adjusted repeatedly (`mt-14`, `mt-12`, `mt-20`, `mt-32`, `mt-12`, `mt-18`, `mt-22`, `mt-28`) to optimize spacing depending on screen sizes and whether a user is logged in (indicated by the presence of a `jwtToken`). This indicates iterative refinement for responsiveness.
* **Conditional rendering:**  The margin of the Right Image section was conditionally changed based on the presence of the `jwtToken`.
* **Typographic changes:** Minor font size adjustments across several elements (h1, p, span) for improved visual hierarchy and readability on different screen sizes.
* **Other minor refinements:**  The code also saw small changes to class names and spacing within the `flex` containers of the banner for refined visual flow and layout improvements.  The unnecessary curly braces in class names were removed.


## 5:05:44 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `ChooseExpert.js` between 4:20 PM and 5:03 PM on April 14, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `ProjectDetails` component, which displays project information and a chat section.  There's a recurring pattern of replacing `<img>` tags with  `<Image>` components from `next/image`. This likely reflects an optimization or upgrade to image handling within the React application.


Specifically:

* **4:20 PM - 4:22 PM:**  Initial commits show the component structure with a progress tracker and  `ProjectDetails`. The styling is primarily done using Tailwind CSS classes. There are a few minor adjustments to the border-radius styling of elements (`rounded-lg`, `rounded-[20px]`, and back to `rounded-lg`). The `minWidth`  property in the progress tracker's step container is also adjusted slightly in a couple of commits. The horizontal progress line's left margin is adjusted slightly (`left-6`, `left-4`, `left-0`, `left-10`, `left-12`, finally settling on `left-12`).

* **4:27 PM - 4:53 PM:**  Significant changes are made to `ProjectDetails` by replacing standard `<img>` tags with `next/image` `<Image>` components for images related to attaching files, app logos, QR codes, and calendar/express project icons. The  `/api/placeholder` image sources are replaced with more specific paths under `/landing-page/project/`.  The new image paths include `AttachFile.svg`, `Buddy.svg`, `calendar.svg`, `scanner.svg`, and `twitter.svg`.  This suggests a move towards using SVG icons for better scalability and potentially improved performance.


* **4:59 PM - 5:03 PM:** The `ProjectDetails` component is entirely commented out, indicating it might have been temporarily removed or moved to a different file.


In summary, the main focus of the changes is refactoring the image handling in the `ProjectDetails` component within `ChooseExpert.js`  by switching to the `next/image` component and using more specific, likely optimized, image paths. The `chooseExpert` component remains largely unchanged throughout the log.
