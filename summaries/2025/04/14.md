# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 12:29:56 AM
The log shows multiple edits to three React component files (`HomeworkBanner.js`, `ReviewCard.js`, `ReachoutExperts.js`) between 11:50 PM and 12:27 AM on April 13th and 14th, 2025.

`HomeworkBanner.js`: This file underwent several revisions focusing primarily on styling adjustments.  Changes included tweaking font sizes (`lg:text-[46px]` to `lg:text-[42px]`, then further adjustments to  `lg:text-[18px]`), adding and removing `mt` classes for responsiveness, and minor modifications to button margin classes (`mb-2` and `md:mt-2` adjustments). These edits suggest iterative improvements to the component's layout and responsiveness across different screen sizes.  The core functionality, including modal handling and form submission, remained consistent.


`ReviewCard.js`: This file, containing a review carousel component, remained largely unchanged. The major alteration was a small increase in the heading font size (`md:text-[34px]` to `md:text-[35px]`). The structure and functionality of the carousel, including its responsive design and navigation, were not significantly altered.


`ReachoutExperts.js`: This component shows a more substantial evolution. Initially, the file lacked styling for the overlapping features section.  Subsequent revisions added this styling, along with  minor adjustments to border sizes (`border` to `border-[#0000001A] border-t-[1.11px] border-b-[8.9px] border-l-[1.11px] border-r-[1.11px]`),  text sizes (`lg:text-[20px]` to `xl:text-[23px]`), and the addition of `divide-x-2 divide-[#0000001A]` to create visual separators between sections.  Furthermore, the width of the left content section was adjusted (`md:w-1/2` to `md:w-3/5`) and the right section (`md:w-1/2` to `md:w-2/5`), impacting the overall layout.  Some input fields also received improved styling (adding `focus` classes).  Comment sections were also added and removed at various stages showing comments being used for temporary disabling and later enabling certain sections in the code. The overall evolution points to significant improvements in the UI/UX and responsiveness of this component.


## 1:29:55 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ReachoutExperts.js`, a React component likely part of a landing page.  Changes were made between 12:30 AM and 1:29 AM on April 14th, 2025.

The primary focus of the revisions appears to be on styling and layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  Many changes involve tweaking class names to modify spacing (`pt-12`, `pb-8`, `min-h-[880px]`, `md:min-h-[750px]`, etc.),  text sizes (`text-[28px]`, `md:text-[32px]`, etc.),  and button styles (`rounded-3xl`, `rounded-[100px]`). There's also some adjustment to the `max-w` property for better responsiveness.  A box shadow was added to the "Find an Expert" button.

Around 12:49 AM, a significant restructuring occurred. The code was extensively commented out, and a new version was introduced. This new version involved improvements to responsiveness  using more semantic Tailwind classes (e.g., `text-H4`, `text-P3`) and a change in the image used on the right-hand side (`/landing-page/expert-side.svg` replacing `/landing-page/homework/expert.svg`). The button text changed from "Find an Expert" to "Let's Get Started."

After 1:20 AM, further adjustments to text sizes within headings and paragraphs are observed, along with minor refinements to the image's max width and height and the  `-mt` (margin-top) adjustments for the features section.  The overall pattern indicates iterative refinements to achieve optimal visual presentation across different screen sizes.  The commented-out section suggests an attempt to preserve the earlier version for potential future reference.  The commented out section and the final version suggest a shift in design approach.


## 10:41:26 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `ReachoutExperts.js` and several edits to `StudyBay.js` and `ClaimOffer.js`.  The changes to `ReachoutExperts.js` primarily involve adjustments to the styling and positioning of elements within the component, specifically the `Image` components and their respective class names. These adjustments span a period from 1:58 AM to 2:20 AM.  The changes are iterative, with small modifications to positioning values (`-left-4`, `-left-6`, `-left-10`, `-left-12`, etc.) across multiple commits.  There's also one change impacting the `expert.svg` Image's dimensions, gradually reducing the width from an extremely large value (4210px) to 420px.  The `z-index` property of a div containing the expert image is also modified from 3 to 30.

The `StudyBay.js` file shows changes between 2:22 AM and 2:26 AM, primarily adjusting the size of the crown image within the `ExpertBuddyCarousel` component across different screen sizes.

The `ClaimOffer.js` file undergoes changes between 9:51 AM and 10:22 AM. The updates involve adding margin and padding values (`mt-`, `md:p-10`, `md:pt-10`) and adjusting text sizes (`text-[16px]`, `text-[18px]`, `text-[28px]`, `text-[35px]`). The size of the "Susan White" text is increased and a box shadow is added to the button.  The modifications are made in a relatively short timespan, and are not iterative in the same manner as those in `ReachoutExperts.js`.  A recurring theme across all three files is the use of responsive design techniques using Tailwind CSS (`xs:`, `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`).


## 11:41:18 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ClaimOffer.js` on April 14th, 2025, between 11:02 AM and 11:38 AM.  The changes primarily involve adjustments to styling using Tailwind CSS classes.  Specific modifications include altering text sizes (`text-[...]`) across different screen sizes (using `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` prefixes) for headings (h1, h2) and paragraphs (p).  There are also minor adjustments to margins (`mt-`, `mb-`, `ml-`, `pr-`), padding (`p-`, `px-`, `py-`), and heights (`max-h-`, `h-`). One notable change involves increasing the height of the phone input field (`lg:h-[60px]`) and the size of the flag image  (`lg:w-[28px] lg:h-[28px]`).  The overall pattern suggests iterative refinements to the component's responsiveness and visual appeal across various screen sizes.  The core functionality of the component (displaying an offer and collecting a phone number) remained unchanged throughout these revisions.  There is also a single log entry for `WelcomePage.js` at 11:27:02 AM,  which shows a significant code block containing state management, API calls (using axiosInstance), file upload functionality, and UI elements. This component appears to handle the creation of a new homework assignment.
