# Activity Summary for 4/28/2025

## 10:58:48 AM
The log shows several React component updates within a frontend application, primarily focused on a landing page.  The most significant changes occurred between 10:26 AM and 10:57 AM on April 28, 2025.

`ActiveCard.js` (10:26 AM, 10:57 AM): This component displays project cards.  Multiple revisions focused on styling adjustments, particularly  adding responsive design features (adjustments for different screen sizes using CSS classes like `2xs`, `xs`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).  The changes involved consistent updates to text sizes, padding, margins, and background colors based on project status (`type`).  The `getTypeStyle` and `getQuestionStyle` functions are used to dynamically apply styles based on the project's status.

`HomeworkBanner.js` (10:30 AM, 10:54 AM): This component is a landing page banner.  A major revision (10:54 AM) removed the `WelcomeModal` and replaced the "Find an Expert" button functionality.  For authenticated users (with a `jwtToken`), it now redirects to `/homework/order-request` instead of displaying the modal.  For unauthenticated users, it remains a form submission that shows a `SignupModal`.  Earlier versions (10:30 AM) included a form for project description and a switch for "Human Experts Only", along with conditional modal display based on authentication status.

`order-request/page.jsx` (10:31 AM, 10:53 AM): This page displays a `WelcomeModal` upon loading, redirecting the user upon closing the modal using `router.back()`.  This indicates a flow where users are directed here after authentication or a relevant action.

`InviteExpertCard.js` (10:37 AM): This component renders cards for inviting experts. It contains responsive design elements, uses Lucide-React icons, and implements a click-outside handler for a modal that explains the payment process.  The modal shows a step-by-step explanation of the payment method.

`LikeExpert.js` (10:37 AM): This component displays when a user dislikes an expert, offering buttons to either see all experts or change the assigned expert.

The overall pattern suggests iterative development, with multiple minor revisions to `ActiveCard.js` aiming for refined styling and responsive design across various screen sizes. The changes to `HomeworkBanner.js` and `order-request/page.jsx` show a refactoring towards a more streamlined user flow upon authentication.  The consistent use of `Image` components from `next/image` and the prevalent use of Tailwind CSS styling demonstrate a consistent technology stack.
