# Activity Summary for 4/28/2025

## 10:58:48 AM
The log shows several React component updates within a frontend application, primarily focused on a landing page.  The most significant changes occurred between 10:26 AM and 10:57 AM on April 28, 2025.

`ActiveCard.js` (10:26 AM, 10:57 AM): This component displays project cards.  Multiple revisions focused on styling adjustments, particularly  adding responsive design features (adjustments for different screen sizes using CSS classes like `2xs`, `xs`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).  The changes involved consistent updates to text sizes, padding, margins, and background colors based on project status (`type`).  The `getTypeStyle` and `getQuestionStyle` functions are used to dynamically apply styles based on the project's status.

`HomeworkBanner.js` (10:30 AM, 10:54 AM): This component is a landing page banner.  A major revision (10:54 AM) removed the `WelcomeModal` and replaced the "Find an Expert" button functionality.  For authenticated users (with a `jwtToken`), it now redirects to `/homework/order-request` instead of displaying the modal.  For unauthenticated users, it remains a form submission that shows a `SignupModal`.  Earlier versions (10:30 AM) included a form for project description and a switch for "Human Experts Only", along with conditional modal display based on authentication status.

`order-request/page.jsx` (10:31 AM, 10:53 AM): This page displays a `WelcomeModal` upon loading, redirecting the user upon closing the modal using `router.back()`.  This indicates a flow where users are directed here after authentication or a relevant action.

`InviteExpertCard.js` (10:37 AM): This component renders cards for inviting experts. It contains responsive design elements, uses Lucide-React icons, and implements a click-outside handler for a modal that explains the payment process.  The modal shows a step-by-step explanation of the payment method.

`LikeExpert.js` (10:37 AM): This component displays when a user dislikes an expert, offering buttons to either see all experts or change the assigned expert.

The overall pattern suggests iterative development, with multiple minor revisions to `ActiveCard.js` aiming for refined styling and responsive design across various screen sizes. The changes to `HomeworkBanner.js` and `order-request/page.jsx` show a refactoring towards a more streamlined user flow upon authentication.  The consistent use of `Image` components from `next/image` and the prevalent use of Tailwind CSS styling demonstrate a consistent technology stack.


## 11:58:51 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `ActiveCard.js` throughout the morning of April 28th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  There's a consistent pattern of modifications to font sizes (`2xs:text-[...]`, `xs:text-[...]`, `md:text-[...]`, `lg:text-[...]`),  padding, and margins across various elements within the component.  The `border border-red-500` class was added to several divs, specifically related to the Expert section and Bid Count/Price section at 11:14:10 AM, and remained until the end of the log.

Between 11:18 AM and 11:19 AM, several text sizes within the `Bid Count` and `Price` sections were adjusted.  Around 11:35 AM to 11:39 AM,  further font size adjustments were made, particularly in the Bid Count, Price, and Expert sections.  Specifically, the font sizes for the expert section and the Bid count were changed multiple times.  The `Open Chat` button's padding was also adjusted at 11:36:56 AM.

At 11:51 AM and 11:52 AM,  a section of code (`<div className=' border border-red-500' > ... </div>`) containing bid count and price information was commented out, indicating a possible change in the display of this information. Finally, this comment was removed at 11:56:58 AM and the code related to `Bid Count` and `Price` was restructured to conditionally render these elements only if both `project.bidCount` and `project.price` are available.  The expert section's font size was also changed at 11:37:35 AM and 11:38:05 AM.

The `src\app\homework\new-project\page.jsx` file was also modified twice at 11:45 AM and 11:46 AM,  switching between rendering `ActiveProjects` and `CreateNewProject` components. This suggests the page's functionality was changed to display a new project creation form instead of a list of active projects, or vice-versa.  There was a single empty code entry for `src\app\homework\new-project\page.jsx` at 11:45:25 AM.


## 12:58:56 PM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `ActiveCard.js` and `CreateNewProject.js`.  `ActiveCard.js` underwent several edits between 11:59:07 AM and 11:59:36 AM, but the code remained largely unchanged in those revisions. The only noticeable difference in these edits was a minor restructuring within the JSX related to the Bid Count and Price display; some commented-out code was removed in the final revision at 11:59:36 AM. A further significant change occurred at 12:00:23 PM, where a `border border-red-500` class was removed from a div.


The `CreateNewProject.js` component saw substantial changes between 12:02:53 PM and 12:58:36 PM. These changes primarily focused on styling adjustments and minor UI improvements.  Specifically:


*   The header image was removed (commented out) between 12:05:03 PM and 12:05:15 PM.
*   The `text[16px]` class in the project title label was added at around 12:10:38 PM.
*   The `attach` button styling was altered and the text size was increased several times between 12:11:04 PM and 12:14:30 PM.
*   At 12:14:30 PM, the rounded corners for the "Type of Order" option were adjusted, from `rounded-lg` to `rounded-[3px]` and later to `rounded-[30px]`. The border style of the selected option was modified several times.
*   The `expert` image was replaced with `invitee.svg` around 12:19:58 PM.  The dimensions of the delete button icon were changed to `w-[64px] h-[48px]`  around 12:22:04 PM and later the button class was removed around 12:22:52 PM and 12:23:14PM.
*   The styling of the `Content` label and `textarea` was refined, including font size and `focus:ring` color changes, between 12:54:27 PM and 12:58:36 PM. The color of the maximum character count was changed from `text-purple-600` to `text-[#6B7B93]` at 12:56:12 PM.
* The `Project Type` and `Project Subject` labels  were given the `text-[16px]` styling  at 12:57:16 PM.
*  The border styling for select options was consistently modified throughout the updates. The overall border style for the invite expert button was changed multiple times as well.


The consistent use of inline styles with bracket notation (`bg-[#color]`, `text-[size]`) is a recurring pattern throughout the code.  The modifications suggest an iterative process of UI refinement and styling adjustments rather than major functional changes.  The final edits appear to focus on improving visual consistency and responsiveness.


## 1:58:53 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CreateNewProject.js` between 12:59 PM and 1:17 PM, and to `LikeExpert.js` between 1:29 PM and 1:30 PM, and finally to `CreateProject.js` at 1:32 PM and `ExpertLandingPage.js` at 1:37 PM on April 28th, 2025.

The `CreateNewProject.js` file underwent extensive styling changes.  Most revisions involved adjustments to the `className` attributes, primarily modifying font sizes (`text-[...]`), padding (`p-[...]`), margins (`mb-[...]`, `mt-[...]`, `ml-[...]`), colors (`bg-[#...]`, `text-[#...]`, `border-[#...]`), and spacing (`gap-[...]`, `space-x-[...]`). There was also a shift from using multiple individual avatar images to a single `multipleavtar.svg` image for the "Auto-Match a writer for me" section.  The `'border-[#A414D5]'` class was consistently used for styling elements related to order options, indicating a consistent design theme.  Finally, the file was completely commented out at 1:23:58 PM and then re-written afterwards.

The `LikeExpert.js` file saw minor updates, mainly focusing on refining text sizes (`text-[...]`) for better responsiveness across different screen sizes. The changes are less extensive compared to those in `CreateNewProject.js`.

The `CreateProject.js` file introduces responsive tabs with a dynamically updating indicator, which positions itself based on the currently selected tab and accounts for the horizontal scrolling of the tab container. The code uses `useEffect` hooks and `useRef` to manage the tab state, indicator position, and scrolling behavior, demonstrating a more complex interaction than in the `CreateNewProject.js` file.


The `ExpertLandingPage.js` file contains a hero section with a prominent call to action, showcasing a form to input project name and deadline.  It then features a section highlighting key features with icons and descriptions.  Extensive styling using Tailwind CSS is present, similar to the `CreateNewProject.js` file, ensuring responsiveness.
