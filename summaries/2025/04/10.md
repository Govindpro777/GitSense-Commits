# Activity Summary for 4/10/2025

## 1:12:28 AM
The codebase reflects a web application managing orders, likely for a manufacturing or design process.  Several key areas are updated across the log:

**Sidebar.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:12:51 AM):** This component renders a sidebar navigation menu, dynamically adjusting its content based on the user's account type (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts).  The menu items are defined in a `menuItems` object, and conditional rendering ensures only relevant options are shown. A logout functionality is implemented. The sidebar is responsive, collapsing on smaller screens.

**DisplayOrder.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:13:22 AM):** This page displays and manages display orders.  It fetches orders from a backend endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/assigned`), allowing filtering by search term and order status.  Users can update order statuses via a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/updateStatus`. The UI includes a search bar, status filter dropdown, loading indicator, and error handling.  Status badges show different colors according to the order status.

**DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:13:45 AM & 4/10/2025, 12:45:45 AM):** This modal displays details of a selected display order.  Significant updates include improved file download management (`FileDownloadManager`) which handles downloading single files, all files of a type (CAD or images), and all files as a ZIP archive via API endpoints like `/api/v1/admin/files/download-all/`. There is also improved image display and handling in the `ImagesSection` component. The code is refactored to make it more modular.


**GraphicsOrder.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:14:11 AM):**  Similar to `DisplayOrder.jsx`, but for graphics orders. It fetches orders from `/api/v1/admin/assigned`, includes searching and filtering by status. Users can update order status using `/api/v1/admin/updateWorkQueue`. A modal for image previews is also integrated, and file upload functionality is suggested by component imports (`FileUploadModal`).

**UploadedFilesModal.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:14:36 AM):** This modal displays uploaded files (images and CAD files) for a specific order.  It allows download of individual files and provides tabs for easy switching between images and CAD files.

**CreateNewOrder.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:17:06 AM & 4/10/2025, 12:58:11 AM):** This component facilitates creating new orders.  It allows selecting a customer, entering requirements and dimensions, assigning to a user, and uploading images.  Order creation POST request is sent to `/api/v1/admin/createOrder/:customerId`.

**Orders.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:17:59 AM - 4/10/2025, 12:21:01 AM):** This file appears to be a previous version of an orders page, which is largely commented out and replaced in later commits. This suggests a major UI overhaul.

**PreviewCadfiles.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:20:08 AM):** This component previews CAD files and images, providing options for previewing and removing files. It handles both File objects and URL strings.

**EditOrder.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:22:55 AM & 4/10/2025, 12:23:41 AM):**  Allows editing existing orders.  It fetches order details from `/api/v1/admin/getOrderById/:orderId`,  supports updating requirements, dimensions, status, and assigned user.  It also allows uploading new images while keeping existing ones.  The update uses a PUT request to `/api/v1/admin/updateOrder/:orderId`. The component also contains a feature for image preview.

**auth.js (4/10/2025, 12:36:30 AM - 4/10/2025, 12:37:51 AM):** This middleware handles authentication and authorization.  It verifies JWT tokens and checks user roles (Admin, SuperAdmin, Accounts, Graphics, Display) to restrict access to specific routes. Minor updates in this file were made to correct a logical error in isDisplayAndAdmin function.

**admin.routes.js (4/10/2025, 12:41:08 AM - 4/10/2025, 1:09:39 AM):** This file defines the backend routes for the application.  It uses middleware functions from `auth.js` to protect routes based on user roles. Many new routes are added to support order management, file uploads and downloads, and the display user functionality. These include endpoints for:
*   creating, updating and deleting leads and customers
*   managing orders, assignments and approvals
*   uploading and downloading files for graphics and display users. The routes are organized by functionality and role-based access. Redundant routes are removed.

**display.controller.js (4/10/2025, 12:47:45 AM - 4/10/2025, 12:52:53 AM):** This controller handles the display user's interactions with the backend. The main functionality includes assigning orders to display users, fetching CAD files associated with an order, and a function to delete CAD files or photos. A socket.io integration is used to notify assigned display users.


**graphics.controller.js (4/10/2025, 12:53:44 AM):** This controller manages actions related to graphics users and orders.  It includes order creation, fetching pending orders, reassigning unassigned orders, retrieving user-assigned orders, and updating the status of a work queue item. A key feature is the implementation of an asynchronous function to determine the availability of graphics users, helping assign new orders efficiently. The controller also incorporates local file upload functionality.

In summary, the log shows a significant development effort focused on enhancing the order management system, adding features for different user roles, implementing robust file handling (including uploads and downloads), and refining the UI/UX.  The most significant changes involve the addition of extensive backend functionality for order management,  file handling, and improved UI components for different user roles.  The repeated use of `localStorage` for storing user information and `fetch` for API calls is a notable pattern.
