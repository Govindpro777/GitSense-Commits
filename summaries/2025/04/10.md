# Activity Summary for 4/10/2025

## 1:12:28 AM
The codebase reflects a web application managing orders, likely for a manufacturing or design process.  Several key areas are updated across the log:

**Sidebar.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:12:51 AM):** This component renders a sidebar navigation menu, dynamically adjusting its content based on the user's account type (SuperAdmin, Admin, Graphics, Display, Accounts).  The menu items are defined in a `menuItems` object, and conditional rendering ensures only relevant options are shown. A logout functionality is implemented. The sidebar is responsive, collapsing on smaller screens.

**DisplayOrder.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:13:22 AM):** This page displays and manages display orders.  It fetches orders from a backend endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/assigned`), allowing filtering by search term and order status.  Users can update order statuses via a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/updateStatus`. The UI includes a search bar, status filter dropdown, loading indicator, and error handling.  Status badges show different colors according to the order status.

**DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:13:45 AM & 4/10/2025, 12:45:45 AM):** This modal displays details of a selected display order.  Significant updates include improved file download management (`FileDownloadManager`) which handles downloading single files, all files of a type (CAD or images), and all files as a ZIP archive via API endpoints like `/api/v1/admin/files/download-all/`. There is also improved image display and handling in the `ImagesSection` component. The code is refactored to make it more modular.


**GraphicsOrder.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:14:11 AM):**  Similar to `DisplayOrder.jsx`, but for graphics orders. It fetches orders from `/api/v1/admin/assigned`, includes searching and filtering by status. Users can update order status using `/api/v1/admin/updateWorkQueue`. A modal for image previews is also integrated, and file upload functionality is suggested by component imports (`FileUploadModal`).

**UploadedFilesModal.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:14:36 AM):** This modal displays uploaded files (images and CAD files) for a specific order.  It allows download of individual files and provides tabs for easy switching between images and CAD files.

**CreateNewOrder.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:17:06 AM & 4/10/2025, 12:58:11 AM):** This component facilitates creating new orders.  It allows selecting a customer, entering requirements and dimensions, assigning to a user, and uploading images.  Order creation POST request is sent to `/api/v1/admin/createOrder/:customerId`.

**Orders.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:17:59 AM - 4/10/2025, 12:21:01 AM):** This file appears to be a previous version of an orders page, which is largely commented out and replaced in later commits. This suggests a major UI overhaul.

**PreviewCadfiles.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:20:08 AM):** This component previews CAD files and images, providing options for previewing and removing files. It handles both File objects and URL strings.

**EditOrder.jsx (4/10/2025, 12:22:55 AM & 4/10/2025, 12:23:41 AM):**  Allows editing existing orders.  It fetches order details from `/api/v1/admin/getOrderById/:orderId`,  supports updating requirements, dimensions, status, and assigned user.  It also allows uploading new images while keeping existing ones.  The update uses a PUT request to `/api/v1/admin/updateOrder/:orderId`. The component also contains a feature for image preview.

**auth.js (4/10/2025, 12:36:30 AM - 4/10/2025, 12:37:51 AM):** This middleware handles authentication and authorization.  It verifies JWT tokens and checks user roles (Admin, SuperAdmin, Accounts, Graphics, Display) to restrict access to specific routes. Minor updates in this file were made to correct a logical error in isDisplayAndAdmin function.

**admin.routes.js (4/10/2025, 12:41:08 AM - 4/10/2025, 1:09:39 AM):** This file defines the backend routes for the application.  It uses middleware functions from `auth.js` to protect routes based on user roles. Many new routes are added to support order management, file uploads and downloads, and the display user functionality. These include endpoints for:
*   creating, updating and deleting leads and customers
*   managing orders, assignments and approvals
*   uploading and downloading files for graphics and display users. The routes are organized by functionality and role-based access. Redundant routes are removed.

**display.controller.js (4/10/2025, 12:47:45 AM - 4/10/2025, 12:52:53 AM):** This controller handles the display user's interactions with the backend. The main functionality includes assigning orders to display users, fetching CAD files associated with an order, and a function to delete CAD files or photos. A socket.io integration is used to notify assigned display users.


**graphics.controller.js (4/10/2025, 12:53:44 AM):** This controller manages actions related to graphics users and orders.  It includes order creation, fetching pending orders, reassigning unassigned orders, retrieving user-assigned orders, and updating the status of a work queue item. A key feature is the implementation of an asynchronous function to determine the availability of graphics users, helping assign new orders efficiently. The controller also incorporates local file upload functionality.

In summary, the log shows a significant development effort focused on enhancing the order management system, adding features for different user roles, implementing robust file handling (including uploads and downloads), and refining the UI/UX.  The most significant changes involve the addition of extensive backend functionality for order management,  file handling, and improved UI components for different user roles.  The repeated use of `localStorage` for storing user information and `fetch` for API calls is a notable pattern.


## 10:15:56 AM
The log shows several code changes across frontend and backend components between 9:22 AM and 10:05 AM on April 10, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on file download functionality, order management, and user roles.

**`METAL-frontend` Changes:**

* **`DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Multiple Updates):** This component underwent significant revisions related to file downloading.  Initially, commented-out imports for `lucide-react` icons were present.  Subsequent updates added these imports, and the core change involved refactoring the file download logic within the `FileDownloadManager` component.  The improvements to the `FileDownloadManager` include handling various download types ("all", "type", "single"), incorporating error handling, and providing visual feedback during the download process.  A  `console.log` statement was added to `CadFilesSection` for debugging purposes.  The final update at 9:48:51 AM modified the API endpoint used for file downloads.

**`Metal-backend` Changes:**

* **`graphics.controller.js` (Multiple Updates):** This controller handles order creation and management.  The primary changes revolve around the `createOrder` function.  This function was enhanced to support optional assignment of an order to a graphics user (`assignedTo` parameter).  If no user is explicitly assigned,  the `findAvailableGraphicsUser` helper function is used to assign it to the least busy available graphics user.  The changes also included error handling, transaction management using Mongoose sessions, and notification sending via Socket.IO (`sendAssignmentNotification`). No significant changes were observed in other functions.

* **`admin.routes.js` (Two Updates):** This file defines backend routes. The updates added new routes for  downloading all files (`/files/download-all/:documentId`, `/file/download-all/:documentId`) and downloading all files of a specific type (`/files/download-all-type/:documentId`, `/file/download-all-type/:documentId`).  The route structure clearly indicates separation of concerns for admin and display user functionalities.

* **`display.controller.js` (Multiple Updates):**  This controller manages display user actions.  Significant changes are the addition of `downloadAllFiles` functionality (using the `archiver` library to create zip archives) and improvements to the existing `downloadCadFile` function. The updates for this controller were focused on fixing bugs and improving the `downloadCadFile` method by changing from `Cad.findUnique` to `Cad.findOne` and adding missing error handling.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* **File Downloads:** A consistent theme throughout the changes is the improvement and expansion of file download capabilities. The system now supports downloading all files, files of a specific type, and individual files, with clear error handling and user feedback.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** The use of `localStorage.getItem("token")` in the frontend and authentication middleware (`auth`, `isAdmin`, `isGraphics`, etc.) in the backend ensures secure access to resources based on user roles.
* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Extensive use of `async/await` for database interactions and file handling reflects a best practice for managing asynchronous operations.
* **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks is consistently applied, improving the system's resilience.
* **Mongoose and MongoDB:**  The backend uses Mongoose for database interactions, demonstrating a reliance on MongoDB for data persistence.
* **Socket.IO:** The use of Socket.IO for real-time notifications indicates a focus on providing immediate feedback to users.


In summary, the code changes represent a significant enhancement to the application's file management and order processing capabilities, particularly focusing on improving the user experience and system robustness.  The changes also demonstrate a well-structured approach to authentication, authorization, and error handling.


## 11:50:20 AM
The log shows a series of changes to `WelcomePage.js` and `FAQHomework.js` components, primarily focusing on styling and minor content adjustments.  `WelcomePage.js` undergoes numerous modifications, all resulting in the component being commented out. This suggests a complete removal or temporary disabling of the component.  These changes span from 10:56 AM to 11:32 AM.

`FAQHomework.js` experiences minor adjustments to its styling, specifically the positioning of an image element (`Vector1.svg`) within the component.  These adjustments involve adding and modifying CSS classes to fine-tune the image's placement and responsiveness at different screen sizes. The changes to this file are between 11:38 AM and 11:40 AM.


`ReviewCard.js`  is concerned with a carousel of reviews. The code shows modifications to text size, spacing, and image positioning within the review cards and the overall carousel structure.  There are also refinements to the responsive design, adapting the layout based on different screen sizes. This happens between 11:41 AM and 11:48 AM.

`How-It-Works.js` shows small adjustments to the positioning of an image element (`Vector1.svg`) similar to those in `FAQHomework.js`, affecting its left and top offsets.  There is also a change to the border styling of one element to include a left and right border in addition to the top and bottom ones. These changes are between 11:42 AM and 11:49 AM.

`TrustHomework.js` file shows a major refactoring of the component code, improving its responsive design across various screen sizes (2xs to 2xl).  There are considerable changes to the CSS classes to achieve better responsiveness in text sizes, spacing, and component dimensions. This component remains uncommented throughout the changes which occured between 11:44 AM and 11:48 AM.  The most significant changes involve the addition of numerous responsive CSS classes using Tailwind CSS syntax (e.g., `2xs:`, `xs:`, `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`), illustrating a focus on making the component adapt seamlessly to different screen resolutions.


## 2:24:26 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to four React component files (`How-It-Works.js`, `ClaimOffer.js`, and `ReachoutExperts.js`, `WelcomePage.js`) within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project between 11:50 AM and 2:23 PM on April 10, 2025.

`How-It-Works.js`: This component, displaying a "How It Works" section, underwent several revisions primarily focusing on styling adjustments.  Changes included modifications to padding, margins, border styles, and the layout (flexbox properties)  for better responsiveness across different screen sizes.  The image placements within the steps were also adjusted for better visual presentation. These changes were made in quick succession between 11:50 AM and 11:54 AM.  A significant style update happened at 11:54 AM, with the addition of responsive text sizing using viewport units (`vw`).

`ClaimOffer.js`: This component, a "Claim Your Offer" section, experienced minor styling changes between 11:58 AM and 12:00 PM.  Padding, margin, and font size adjustments were the main modifications, aiming for improved visual consistency and responsiveness.  An earlier version of the code (commented out) is also present, suggesting an iterative development process.

`ReachoutExperts.js`: This component, a "Reach Out to Experts" section, underwent substantial revisions, mostly concerning styling and layout improvements, from 12:00 PM to 12:11 PM.  The changes included adjustments to padding, margins, and responsive text sizes, similar to `How-It-Works.js`.  The most noticeable change was a significant restructuring of the layout using flexbox for better responsiveness and visual appeal.  Also, a calendar icon was added and then refined in its placement.  The final version implemented a more streamlined approach for displaying features using a map function.


`WelcomePage.js`: This component, a welcome modal, shows a significant evolution between 1:30 PM and 2:23 PM.  The initial version included a basic structure with input fields and a date picker.  Subsequent changes involved upgrading the date picker component, removing unnecessary imports, and making use of  `Popover` and `Button` components from the project's UI library.  This suggests improvements to the user interface and interaction. The code also incorporated  dynamic time selection in the date picker.  The final version removed or commented out extensive time selection, focusing primarily on date selection.

A recurring pattern across all files is the extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling, indicating a consistent design system implementation.  The frequent updates within short time intervals suggest an agile development process with iterative refinement of the UI elements.  The use of responsive design techniques (adjusting styles based on screen size) is consistent throughout all components.


## 3:24:27 PM
The log shows significant changes to two React component files: `HomeworkBanner.js` and `WelcomePage.js`.

`HomeworkBanner.js` underwent minor revisions between 2:24:42 PM and 2:25:01 PM on April 10, 2025.  The primary change involved replacing a `<Button>` component with a `<span>` element for the "Human experts only" option within the form.  The overall structure and functionality of the component remained unchanged.

`WelcomePage.js` shows a much more substantial evolution.  Initially (2:25:44 PM), it contained fully commented-out code representing a more extensive form with features for setting a title, content, file attachment, subject categories and subjects, word count, budget, and deadline.  The code incorporated elements like `lucide-react` icons, a custom date picker, and state management for various form inputs.

Between 2:32:28 PM and 2:33:55 PM,  the component was significantly reworked, with the commented-out code replaced by a functional component.  Key additions included:

*   Integration of `@mantine/dates` for date/time selection, replacing the custom date picker.
*   The introduction of `axios` for API calls, suggesting the addition of a backend interaction to fetch budget suggestions.
*   Implementation of a `fetchBudgetSuggestion` function to dynamically update the budget based on selected type, subject, and word count.
*   Use of a dropdown for selecting the type of assignment instead of a text input.  A constant `typeOptions` provides a list of valid types.
*   The component now fetches subject categories from `localStorage`, dynamically populating subject selection based on the selected category.

From 2:39:54 PM to 3:12:11 PM, the `WelcomePage.js` file was repeatedly commented out and uncommented, indicating potential experimentation or debugging. The final version (3:12:11 PM) is a functional form that uses `@mantine/dates` for date and time selection and a more refined structure.  The  commented-out versions in this period suggest that much of this component may have been written or rewritten multiple times during this process.  The final commit includes styling imports (`@mantine/core/styles.css`, `@mantine/dates/styles.css`, `@mantine/dropzone/styles.css`, `@mantine/code-highlight/styles.css`), pointing to the use of the Mantine UI library.


A recurring theme is the use of various UI libraries (Mantine, potentially others based on the commented-out code) and local storage for data persistence (subject categories).  The development of `WelcomePage.js` indicates an iterative process involving significant design and functionality changes over a relatively short time period.


## 4:24:25 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `WelcomePage.js` between 3:26 PM and 4:23 PM on April 10, 2025.  The file is a React component for a welcome modal.  Initially, the component was largely commented out, suggesting it was under development.

Significant changes occurred between 4:02 PM and 4:03 PM, representing a major update. This revision:

* **Removed comments:**  The code was uncommented, making it functional.
* **Added authentication:**  The component now integrates with an authentication system, using `useAuth` hook and `Cookies` library to retrieve JWT tokens and user IDs.  The `axios` library was adapted to use this authentication information for API calls.
* **Improved budget fetching:** The API call to `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` changed to a POST request and included a more comprehensive payload.  Error handling was improved with the addition of `sonner` for toast notifications. The logic for calling `fetchBudgetSuggestion` was also refined to ensure all necessary data was present before initiating the request.
* **Added logging:** Extensive console logs were added for debugging purposes, providing detailed information about the fetched data and API requests.  The purpose of the logs is apparent from the comments.
* **Added subject selection:**  A subject selection mechanism was introduced, allowing users to select a subject and its name.  The `handleSubjectChange` function now updates both `selectedSubject` and `selectedSubjectName`.
* **Minor UI updates:** The code remains largely unchanged in terms of its user interface rendering, mostly in the JSX portion.


Between 4:22 PM and 4:23 PM, the code was entirely commented out again, indicating that it might be undergoing further debugging or refactoring. This is confirmed by the last commit at 4:23 PM, which shows the component again entirely commented out.  The changes made between 4:02 PM and 4:03 PM were reverted. The overall pattern shows a cycle of development, testing and potential rollback in the `WelcomePage.js` component.


## 5:24:25 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to `WelcomePage.js` throughout the afternoon of April 10th, 2025.  The file is a React component representing a modal.  Early revisions (4:24 PM and 4:26 PM) show a largely commented-out component with extensive state variables,  `useEffect` hooks for fetching subject categories from localStorage and making API calls for budget suggestions,  and functions for handling user input.  The API calls use `axios` and appear to POST data to  `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` to retrieve a suggested budget. The code heavily uses console logging for debugging purposes. Authentication is handled via JWT tokens retrieved from cookies or an auth context.


A significant change occurs between 4:30 PM and 4:37 PM.  The `WelcomePage.js`  component is now uncommented and substantially fleshed out. A UI is added with input fields for title and content, a file upload feature, and other interactive elements.  The initial default date is changed to April 19th, 2025. The `selectedFile` state variable is modified and updated, and an API endpoint `http://ec2-3-108-218-11.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/api/homework/budget-suggestion` is explicitly defined in the code.


Further revisions (4:48 PM - 4:50 PM and 4:52 PM - 5:12 PM) show minor changes, primarily focused on refining the UI and making the `selectedFile` state an empty object initially. Finally, between 5:16 PM and 5:23 PM, `axiosInstance` is imported from `'@/lib/utils'` to handle the API call, simplifying the code.  The final version shows a complete UI for a homework request form within the modal.  The consistent theme across all revisions is the development and refinement of a user interface for submitting homework requests.  The most significant changes relate to the implementation of the UI and the finalization of the API endpoint.


## 6:24:22 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `WelcomePage.js` between 5:29 PM and 6:23 PM on April 10, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes centers around fetching a budget suggestion from an API endpoint (`http://ec2-3-108-218-11.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/api/homework/budget-suggestion`).

Initially, the code was heavily commented out, suggesting a work-in-progress state.  Early versions relied on `axios` directly for API calls, but later revisions introduced `axiosInstance` from `@/lib/axiosInstance` for better API interaction management, making API calls using `axiosInstance.post`.  The API call uses POST requests and includes user ID and a payload containing homework details (type, subject, subjectId, word count). The response updates the `budget` and `budgetExplanation` states.  Error handling includes displaying a toast message using `sonner`.

Between 5:36 PM and 5:51 PM, substantial UI elements were added, including input fields for "Title" and "Content," an "Attach File" button, and related state variables (`title`, `content`, `selectedFile`, `fileName`).  A `GlobalPopup` component was also imported and used.  The date input was changed from April 19, 2025, to December 19, 2024.   A default user ID ("3cdf58de-51ef-466d-ac52-ed2b16cd3d42") was added for testing purposes.

The code also features multiple `useEffect` hooks.  One handles fetching subject categories from `localStorage` on component mount and another manages updating the available subjects based on the selected category. A crucial `useEffect` triggers the budget suggestion fetch when the modal is open and all necessary data is available.  Further `useEffect` calls handle changes in auth data and fetch the budget suggestion based on changes in relevant parameters.  The final revisions show a refinement of these effect hooks and error handling, with fallback mechanisms implemented for testing.  The `handleWordCountChange` function now includes logic to either update the budget suggestion or set default values for a specific test case involving "RESEARCH_PAPER", "Wordpress", and 1000 words.  The `fetchBudgetSuggestion` function now includes detailed fallback logic, handling potential errors in the API request more gracefully.  The `budgetExplanation` is dynamically created if not provided by API.

Throughout the revisions, extensive `console.log` statements for debugging are present.  There's a consistent pattern of fetching data from `localStorage` ('subjectCategories'), using cookies and `useAuth` for authentication, and using a default fallback user ID and explanation for testing scenarios. The default selected type is changed from "ESSAY" to "RESEARCH_PAPER".
