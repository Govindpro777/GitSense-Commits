# Activity Summary for 4/6/2025

## 1:05:49 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `ReachoutExperts.js` between 12:16 AM and 12:46 AM on April 6th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS,  with a focus on responsiveness across different screen sizes (sm, md, lg).  There were no changes to the core functionality; the component remains a landing page with input fields for project name and deadline, and a "Find an Expert" button.


Specific changes include:

* **12:16 AM - 12:17 AM:** Minor adjustments to the layout of the overlapping features section, primarily tweaking the height (`h-[180px]` to `md:h-[176px]`) and padding (`px-4 py-4` to `md:px-4 md:py-8`). The `max-w-6xl` changed to `max-w-7xl`.

* **12:20 AM - 12:23 AM:** Further refinements to the styling of the features section. Padding adjustments (`px-4 py-8` to `md:px-4 md:py-8` then to `p-4 md:px-4 md:py-8`), and the removal of `space-y-6 sm:space-y-0`.


* **12:30 AM - 12:32 AM:**  Text size adjustments within the features section (`text-[14px] md:text-lg` changed to `text-[14px] md:text-[23px]`).  The `max-w-11/12` was added to the features section.


* **12:46 AM:** This is a significant change. The entire component code was commented out, and a new version was added, which involved more substantial restructuring than the previous edits.  The primary focus in this final version seems to be on improving the responsiveness and symmetry of the right-hand image layout and font sizes  (`text-[28px]` to `text-[28px] md:text-[32px]`). The crown image was also made larger on medium screens (`md:w-[80px] md:h-[80px]`). The button was moved to its own div to help with responsive layout. The images in the right section were made more symmetrical and responsive.

Throughout the edits, the core structure of the React component remains unchanged, with only stylistic changes and minor layout tweaks being implemented.  The frequent edits suggest iterative design improvements based on visual feedback or design specifications.


## 2:05:54 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `StudyBay.js` and `ReachoutExperts.js`  and `FAQHomework.js`  components within a React frontend application.  The changes span approximately one hour, between 1:07 AM and 2:04 AM on April 6th, 2025.

`StudyBay.js` underwent significant restructuring. Initially, the code featured a carousel component (`ExpertBuddyCarousel`) built using SVG icons for various features.  Over several commits, the SVG icons were replaced with images sourced from `/landing-page/homework/studybay-[1-4].svg`. The component's styling was also refined with more precise dimensions (`md:w-[570px] md:h-[256px]`) and updated class names, suggesting improvements in responsiveness and visual design.  The `FeatureCard` component was modified to use `Image` component from `next/image` for improved image handling.  Finally, the code was cleaned up, removing commented-out code sections, resulting in a more concise and functional carousel component.

`ReachoutExperts.js` saw  improvements to its responsiveness. The layout of the component was adjusted to be more symmetrical and responsive, particularly concerning the image arrangement on the right-hand side.  Specific image sizes and positions were adjusted to improve the visual appeal across different screen sizes. The text sizes and styles were also refined for better readability.

`FAQHomework.js` underwent several modifications focusing primarily on styling and positioning of the Crown Icon within the component.  The component's initial implementation used a custom accordion structure.  The initial versions used `Image` component from `next/image` to display a crown icon, its positioning was adjusted across multiple commits. Finally, the component was refactored to utilize an `Accordion` component, simplifying the code and enhancing maintainability. The styling and positioning of the crown image and the "Frequently Asked Questions" heading also received several tweaks throughout the commit history.  In the final version, the old accordion implementation was removed and replaced by a cleaner version using an external Accordion component.  The use of a custom SVG was replaced with use of `/landing-page/Vector1.svg` and its positioning tweaked.

In general, the changes demonstrate iterative development, focusing on improving the visual appeal, responsiveness, and code structure of the landing page components.  There is a consistent use of `next/image` for image handling and a pattern of frequent small adjustments to styling and positioning of the elements in the various components throughout the update period.


## 2:40:22 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `Offer.tsx` between 2:24 AM and 2:35 AM on April 6th, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is adjusting the styling and responsiveness of a React component that displays an offer.

Initially, the component's width was fixed (`w-[1170px]`). Subsequent edits adjusted this width to be responsive, using `w-[394px] md:w-[1170px]`, making it narrower on smaller screens.  The height also underwent adjustments, evolving from `h-[474px]` to `h-[544px] md:h-[474px]`, providing different heights based on screen size.

Several modifications targeted the styling of the main container (`div`) and its inner elements through changes in the CSS class names.  These changes involved:

*   Modifying background colors (`bg-[#f5f3ef]`, `bg-[#eabaff]`, then `bg-[#EABAFF]`). Note the slight variation in the hex code for the purple background.
*   Adjusting padding (`p-4`, `p-6 sm:p-8 md:p-10 lg:p-14`).
*   Tweaking width and height values in various media queries (`md`, `sm`).

There's also a notable change in the `h2` element's styling, iterating through different class names related to text size (`text-xl sm:text-2xl`, `text-H5 md:text-H3`, and finally `text-[28px] md:text-[44px]`) to achieve the desired font size adjustments across different screen sizes.  This showcases an iterative approach to finding the optimal styling.

The content of the offer (text and images) remained consistent throughout the revisions.  The overall pattern is one of iterative refinement of layout and styling, focusing on responsiveness and visual appeal.
