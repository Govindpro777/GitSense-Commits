# Activity Summary for 4/6/2025

## 1:05:49 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `ReachoutExperts.js` between 12:16 AM and 12:46 AM on April 6th, 2025.  The changes primarily involve styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS,  with a focus on responsiveness across different screen sizes (sm, md, lg).  There were no changes to the core functionality; the component remains a landing page with input fields for project name and deadline, and a "Find an Expert" button.


Specific changes include:

* **12:16 AM - 12:17 AM:** Minor adjustments to the layout of the overlapping features section, primarily tweaking the height (`h-[180px]` to `md:h-[176px]`) and padding (`px-4 py-4` to `md:px-4 md:py-8`). The `max-w-6xl` changed to `max-w-7xl`.

* **12:20 AM - 12:23 AM:** Further refinements to the styling of the features section. Padding adjustments (`px-4 py-8` to `md:px-4 md:py-8` then to `p-4 md:px-4 md:py-8`), and the removal of `space-y-6 sm:space-y-0`.


* **12:30 AM - 12:32 AM:**  Text size adjustments within the features section (`text-[14px] md:text-lg` changed to `text-[14px] md:text-[23px]`).  The `max-w-11/12` was added to the features section.


* **12:46 AM:** This is a significant change. The entire component code was commented out, and a new version was added, which involved more substantial restructuring than the previous edits.  The primary focus in this final version seems to be on improving the responsiveness and symmetry of the right-hand image layout and font sizes  (`text-[28px]` to `text-[28px] md:text-[32px]`). The crown image was also made larger on medium screens (`md:w-[80px] md:h-[80px]`). The button was moved to its own div to help with responsive layout. The images in the right section were made more symmetrical and responsive.

Throughout the edits, the core structure of the React component remains unchanged, with only stylistic changes and minor layout tweaks being implemented.  The frequent edits suggest iterative design improvements based on visual feedback or design specifications.
