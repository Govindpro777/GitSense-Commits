# Activity Summary for 4/2/2025

## 8:20:14 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `CreateNewOrder.jsx` between 11:32 PM and 11:42 PM on April 1st, 2025.  The initial version was a fully functional React component for creating new orders, featuring:

* **Order creation functionality:**  The component allowed users to input customer name, dimensions, status, assigned user, requirements, and upload images.  It used `axios` for API calls (although this was later removed and likely replaced with `fetch`).  Authentication was handled via a locally stored token.
* **Customer and User auto-completion:** It utilized custom hooks (`useCustomers` and `useGraphicsUsers`) for filtering and displaying customer and user suggestions based on input.
* **Image preview:**  The component displayed previews of uploaded images before submission.

Subsequent revisions involved significant changes:

* **11:36 PM:** The entire component was commented out. This suggests a complete replacement or significant refactoring was planned.
* **11:39 PM and 11:42 PM:**  The commented-out code was replaced with a new version.  These revisions appear to be very similar, implying minor adjustments during these minutes. The key differences observed in this new version were:

    * **Removal of `axios` and use of `fetch` for API calls.**
    * **Change in `imagePreview` state:**  The `imagePreview` state was changed from holding a single URL to an array, allowing multiple image previews.
    * **Addition of `requirements` field:** A field to input requirements was added to the order form.
    * **Addition of `Upload` and `Trash2` icons from `lucide-react`.**  The inclusion of these icons suggests additions to the UI to handle image uploads and potentially image deletion.


The frequent commenting out and replacing of the entire code suggests an iterative development process with potential experimentation or debugging involved. The final version likely reflects a more refined design than the original, incorporating multiple image uploads, and a improved UI.


## 2:23:25 PM
The log shows a single code update to `Navbar.js` at 4/2/2025, 2:08:38 PM.  This update significantly revises the navigation bar component.  The changes introduce responsive design using media queries for desktop and mobile views.  The desktop navbar displays a logo, navigation links ("Find Tutor," "Become Tutor," "Sign In"/"Log Out"), and a "Get Started for free" button.  The mobile navbar utilizes a sheet component for a collapsible menu with similar navigation options.

The code includes user authentication logic.  Upon successful profile completion, the "Sign In" link changes to "Log Out," and the navigation redirects to the home page.  The  `handleLogout` function clears user data from the store and cookies, resetting the navigation links to their default state.  The component uses `react-redux` for state management, `next/navigation` for routing, and `js-cookie` for handling cookies.  Various UI components are imported from a local `ui` library,  and  icons are imported from `react-icons`.  Conditional rendering based on login status is extensively used throughout the component.  The `debugProfileConditions` function checks if the student profile is complete.
