# Activity Summary for 4/2/2025

## 8:20:14 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `CreateNewOrder.jsx` between 11:32 PM and 11:42 PM on April 1st, 2025.  The initial version was a fully functional React component for creating new orders, featuring:

* **Order creation functionality:**  The component allowed users to input customer name, dimensions, status, assigned user, requirements, and upload images.  It used `axios` for API calls (although this was later removed and likely replaced with `fetch`).  Authentication was handled via a locally stored token.
* **Customer and User auto-completion:** It utilized custom hooks (`useCustomers` and `useGraphicsUsers`) for filtering and displaying customer and user suggestions based on input.
* **Image preview:**  The component displayed previews of uploaded images before submission.

Subsequent revisions involved significant changes:

* **11:36 PM:** The entire component was commented out. This suggests a complete replacement or significant refactoring was planned.
* **11:39 PM and 11:42 PM:**  The commented-out code was replaced with a new version.  These revisions appear to be very similar, implying minor adjustments during these minutes. The key differences observed in this new version were:

    * **Removal of `axios` and use of `fetch` for API calls.**
    * **Change in `imagePreview` state:**  The `imagePreview` state was changed from holding a single URL to an array, allowing multiple image previews.
    * **Addition of `requirements` field:** A field to input requirements was added to the order form.
    * **Addition of `Upload` and `Trash2` icons from `lucide-react`.**  The inclusion of these icons suggests additions to the UI to handle image uploads and potentially image deletion.


The frequent commenting out and replacing of the entire code suggests an iterative development process with potential experimentation or debugging involved. The final version likely reflects a more refined design than the original, incorporating multiple image uploads, and a improved UI.

The log shows a single code update to `Navbar.js` at 4/2/2025, 2:08:38 PM.  This update significantly revises the navigation bar component.  The changes introduce responsive design using media queries for desktop and mobile views.  The desktop navbar displays a logo, navigation links ("Find Tutor," "Become Tutor," "Sign In"/"Log Out"), and a "Get Started for free" button.  The mobile navbar utilizes a sheet component for a collapsible menu with similar navigation options.

The code includes user authentication logic.  Upon successful profile completion, the "Sign In" link changes to "Log Out," and the navigation redirects to the home page.  The  `handleLogout` function clears user data from the store and cookies, resetting the navigation links to their default state.  The component uses `react-redux` for state management, `next/navigation` for routing, and `js-cookie` for handling cookies.  Various UI components are imported from a local `ui` library,  and  icons are imported from `react-icons`.  Conditional rendering based on login status is extensively used throughout the component.  The `debugProfileConditions` function checks if the student profile is complete.

The log shows a single code change at 4/2/2025, 4:13:53 PM to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\(auth)\signup\page.js`.  This file contains a React component for user signup.  The component uses `react-hook-form` with zod schema validation for email and password fields.  The password validation enforces minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character requirements.  A password strength checker provides feedback to the user.  The component also handles redirection based on authentication state, using Redux (`registerUser` action) and cookies to manage authentication.  Upon successful signup, it redirects to `/onboarding?step=helpNeeded`. Error handling is included using `toast` notifications. Social login functionality (`SocialLoginButton`) appears to be present, though the implementation details aren't shown in this log entry.  The UI includes visual feedback for password strength and password visibility toggling. The component uses various UI libraries like `@mantine/core` for Popover and react-icons for visual elements.  The code also checks for the user's role (`localStorage.getItem("role")`) before proceeding with the registration.
