# Activity Summary for 4/2/2025

## 8:20:14 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `CreateNewOrder.jsx` between 11:32 PM and 11:42 PM on April 1st, 2025.  The initial version was a fully functional React component for creating new orders, featuring:

* **Order creation functionality:**  The component allowed users to input customer name, dimensions, status, assigned user, requirements, and upload images.  It used `axios` for API calls (although this was later removed and likely replaced with `fetch`).  Authentication was handled via a locally stored token.
* **Customer and User auto-completion:** It utilized custom hooks (`useCustomers` and `useGraphicsUsers`) for filtering and displaying customer and user suggestions based on input.
* **Image preview:**  The component displayed previews of uploaded images before submission.

Subsequent revisions involved significant changes:

* **11:36 PM:** The entire component was commented out. This suggests a complete replacement or significant refactoring was planned.
* **11:39 PM and 11:42 PM:**  The commented-out code was replaced with a new version.  These revisions appear to be very similar, implying minor adjustments during these minutes. The key differences observed in this new version were:

    * **Removal of `axios` and use of `fetch` for API calls.**
    * **Change in `imagePreview` state:**  The `imagePreview` state was changed from holding a single URL to an array, allowing multiple image previews.
    * **Addition of `requirements` field:** A field to input requirements was added to the order form.
    * **Addition of `Upload` and `Trash2` icons from `lucide-react`.**  The inclusion of these icons suggests additions to the UI to handle image uploads and potentially image deletion.


The frequent commenting out and replacing of the entire code suggests an iterative development process with potential experimentation or debugging involved. The final version likely reflects a more refined design than the original, incorporating multiple image uploads, and a improved UI.
