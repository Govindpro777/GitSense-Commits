# Activity Summary for 4/2/2025

## 8:20:14 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `CreateNewOrder.jsx` between 11:32 PM and 11:42 PM on April 1st, 2025.  The initial version was a fully functional React component for creating new orders, featuring:

* **Order creation functionality:**  The component allowed users to input customer name, dimensions, status, assigned user, requirements, and upload images.  It used `axios` for API calls (although this was later removed and likely replaced with `fetch`).  Authentication was handled via a locally stored token.
* **Customer and User auto-completion:** It utilized custom hooks (`useCustomers` and `useGraphicsUsers`) for filtering and displaying customer and user suggestions based on input.
* **Image preview:**  The component displayed previews of uploaded images before submission.

Subsequent revisions involved significant changes:

* **11:36 PM:** The entire component was commented out. This suggests a complete replacement or significant refactoring was planned.
* **11:39 PM and 11:42 PM:**  The commented-out code was replaced with a new version.  These revisions appear to be very similar, implying minor adjustments during these minutes. The key differences observed in this new version were:

    * **Removal of `axios` and use of `fetch` for API calls.**
    * **Change in `imagePreview` state:**  The `imagePreview` state was changed from holding a single URL to an array, allowing multiple image previews.
    * **Addition of `requirements` field:** A field to input requirements was added to the order form.
    * **Addition of `Upload` and `Trash2` icons from `lucide-react`.**  The inclusion of these icons suggests additions to the UI to handle image uploads and potentially image deletion.


The frequent commenting out and replacing of the entire code suggests an iterative development process with potential experimentation or debugging involved. The final version likely reflects a more refined design than the original, incorporating multiple image uploads, and a improved UI.

The log shows a single code update to `Navbar.js` at 4/2/2025, 2:08:38 PM.  This update significantly revises the navigation bar component.  The changes introduce responsive design using media queries for desktop and mobile views.  The desktop navbar displays a logo, navigation links ("Find Tutor," "Become Tutor," "Sign In"/"Log Out"), and a "Get Started for free" button.  The mobile navbar utilizes a sheet component for a collapsible menu with similar navigation options.

The code includes user authentication logic.  Upon successful profile completion, the "Sign In" link changes to "Log Out," and the navigation redirects to the home page.  The  `handleLogout` function clears user data from the store and cookies, resetting the navigation links to their default state.  The component uses `react-redux` for state management, `next/navigation` for routing, and `js-cookie` for handling cookies.  Various UI components are imported from a local `ui` library,  and  icons are imported from `react-icons`.  Conditional rendering based on login status is extensively used throughout the component.  The `debugProfileConditions` function checks if the student profile is complete.

The log shows a single code change at 4/2/2025, 4:13:53 PM to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\(auth)\signup\page.js`.  This file contains a React component for user signup.  The component uses `react-hook-form` with zod schema validation for email and password fields.  The password validation enforces minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character requirements.  A password strength checker provides feedback to the user.  The component also handles redirection based on authentication state, using Redux (`registerUser` action) and cookies to manage authentication.  Upon successful signup, it redirects to `/onboarding?step=helpNeeded`. Error handling is included using `toast` notifications. Social login functionality (`SocialLoginButton`) appears to be present, though the implementation details aren't shown in this log entry.  The UI includes visual feedback for password strength and password visibility toggling. The component uses various UI libraries like `@mantine/core` for Popover and react-icons for visual elements.  The code also checks for the user's role (`localStorage.getItem("role")`) before proceeding with the registration.

The log shows significant updates to the frontend and backend of a Metal-CRM application between 6:10 PM and 6:52 PM on April 2, 2025.

The backend `.env` file was updated at 6:10:36 PM, setting environment variables for port, MongoDB connection, JWT secret, Cloudinary configuration, and client URL.  No further changes were made to this file.

The backend `order.controller.js` file was updated at 6:22:50 PM.  This update involved adding or modifying functions for creating, assigning, fetching (by ID and all), updating, deleting, and approving orders. The functions extensively use Mongoose models (`Order`, `WorkQueueItem`, `Counter`), Cloudinary for image uploads, and handle error responses and data population.  Significant changes include the addition of functionality to update orders with new images via local file upload, and the overall enhancement of error handling and data population in responses.

The frontend `CreateNewOrder.jsx` component underwent multiple revisions between 6:35:06 PM and 6:46:10 PM.  Initially, the component was a fully functional order creation form with features for image uploads, customer and user selection with auto-suggestions, status selection and form submission.  Later revisions removed and re-added the entire component's code multiple times, suggesting a possible iterative development or debugging process. The final version, while functionally similar to the first, is cleaner and utilizes a FormData object for multiple file uploads more effectively.  The changes involved refactoring code to be more readable and efficient, and improving the handling of multiple image uploads.


The frontend `EditOrder.jsx` component also saw multiple revisions between 6:39:58 PM and 6:52:25 PM, similar to `CreateNewOrder.jsx`.  The component was initially a commented-out version of a functional edit order form, similar to the `CreateNewOrder` component structure. It was later updated to include functionality for fetching order details, handling image uploads (including existing images), updating the order with form data, and providing error handling. The most significant changes involved the addition of image upload and management features, and improvements to the handling of form data submission. The changes follow a similar pattern of iterative development and debugging.  The final version implements proper handling of existing images during edits.

In summary, the code changes reflect an iterative development process focused on enhancing the order management functionality of the Metal-CRM application.  The frontend components underwent significant refactoring and additions while the backend controller was improved in error handling and cloudinary image upload implementation.  The frequent commenting-out and reintroduction of entire code blocks in the frontend suggests a process involving experimentation, debugging, and refactoring to improve code clarity and functionality.


## 11:11:02 PM
The log shows modifications to two navigation bar components: `Navbar.js` in the `landingPage` directory and `Navbar.js` in the `CommunityPage` directory.  The changes span a period from 10:35 PM to 10:47 PM on April 2nd, 2025.


**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Navbar.js` Changes:**

Multiple revisions were made to the landing page Navbar between 10:35 PM and 10:40 PM.  The core functionality remained consistent:  a navigation bar with "Find Tutor," "Become Tutor," "Sign In" (which changes to "Log Out" after login), and other links.  The most significant change involved the conditional rendering of the navigation items based on the user's login status.  The code uses cookies to manage login state and features a logout handler which clears user data from Redux store.  The navbar also adapts to different screen sizes, showing a different layout for mobile devices using a Sheet component for the menu.  There were minor UI adjustments  across the multiple revisions in this timeframe; specifically, one of the "Find Tutor" links was changed to "Homework" and then reverted back in subsequent revisions.



**`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\CommunityPage\Navbar.js` Changes:**

The `CommunityPage` Navbar was modified between 10:46 PM and 10:47 PM.  This navbar is simpler, displaying a logo, "Find Tutor", a balance display, a "Refer a Friend" button, language/currency selector, and icons for messaging, help, and notifications.  A `ProfileMenu` component is included.  The most significant change involved adding a second "Find Tutor" link, which was renamed to "Homework" in one revision and then changed to "Homework" in a later version.  The component includes logic to redirect to the `/select-role` page if the user isn't authenticated.
