# Activity Summary for 4/19/2025

## 10:20:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ExpertCard.js`, a React component, between 9:36 AM and 10:20 AM on April 19, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be adding a "Chat" button and displaying tutor's project completion statistics.

The earliest revisions (9:36 AM) show commented-out import statements, suggesting initial cleanup or restructuring. The subsequent revisions at 9:36:55 AM introduced a fully functional component.  This version included a modal for payment information,  responsive design elements using tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `[@media(min-width:426px)]`), and extensive use of inline styles for image sizing across different screen sizes.  The component renders information such as tutor name, image, badges, rating, reviews, bio, price, and a payment modal.

Later revisions between 9:42 AM and 9:59 AM show the component mostly unchanged, with a pattern of the entire code being commented out repeatedly.  This might indicate experimentation or debugging, possibly involving temporary disabling of sections for testing.

Finally, the last two changes (10:18 AM and 10:20 AM) also show the code commented out, leading to the same situation as previous revisions. These changes don't introduce any new features.  The most significant change occurred at 9:36:55 AM, adding the "Chat" button and  project completion statistics.  The large number of commented-out versions suggests a period of iterative development and testing.


## 11:20:20 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ExpertCard.js` between 10:20 AM and 11:18 AM on April 19, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged throughout these revisions; the file content is consistently a React component displaying tutor information (name, image, country flag, badges, rating, bio, price, etc.) and a modal explaining the payment process. The frequent timestamps suggest minor adjustments, likely related to styling or small bug fixes, rather than large-scale functional changes. There's a consistent use of tailwind CSS classes for styling, and responsive design is implemented using media queries (`@media`).  No significant structural alterations were made to the component's functionality.


## 1:08:32 PM
The `HowItWorks.js` component was updated on April 19, 2025, at 12:09:52 PM.  The update primarily involved refinements to the layout and styling of a three-step "How It Works" section.  Specific changes include:

* **Improved Step Layout:** The steps were restructured using flexbox for better responsiveness across different screen sizes (md, lg, xl breakpoints are used).  Images were added to accompany each step, enhancing visual appeal.
* **Responsive Design:**  Numerous style adjustments were made to ensure proper rendering on different screen sizes, using media queries for various viewports.  Calculated widths and heights for images were adjusted based on screen size.
* **Styling Consistency:** Consistent styling was applied to elements such as buttons, step number boxes, and headings.  A color palette using hex codes (e.g., `#f5f3ef`, `#141624`, `#AF32D9`) was used throughout.
* **Image Updates:** Several SVG images were added (`/landing-page/homework/howitwork-2.svg`, `/landing-page/homework/howitwork-1.svg`, `/landing-page/homework/howitwork-3.svg` and others), replacing or supplementing existing ones. The images used throughout all use the `/landing-page` path. The `className` attributes of images were modified to improve the responsiveness and layout.
* **Content Clarification:**  The text within each step was refined for clarity, providing concise descriptions of each stage in the process.  The text content clearly explains steps involved in using the service, and button labels consistently encourage users to "Get Started."
* **Removed/Commented Code:** Several lines of code related to images (lines that previously drew arrows) appear to have been commented out, suggesting a simplification of the design.


The overall change reflects a significant visual and structural improvement to the component, aiming for enhanced user experience and better responsiveness across devices.


## 3:07:07 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to React components within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project.  Significant changes occurred between 2:17 PM and 3:00 PM on April 19, 2025.

The `ChooseExpert.js` component underwent several modifications.  Initially,  it included a progress tracker, main content showcasing tutor availability, and a project details sidebar (`ProjectDetails.js`).  A key change was the addition of the `CompletePayment` component towards the end of the file,  likely to display payment information for the project. The placement and integration of `CompletePayment` changed slightly in subsequent commits.


The `ProjectDetails.js` component was updated to include a modal for file uploads (`UploadFiles.js`), enhancing the file attachment functionality.  The component also features sections for project details, express project options, chat functionality displaying a list of chats, and app promotion content.

The `UploadFiles.js` component, initially commented out, was progressively uncommented and fleshed out over multiple revisions.  This component presents a file upload interface with features like tabbed views, sorting by file type, and the ability to remove files. The initial commits had the file upload functionality commented out, but by the end it was fully functional. This component underwent the most revisions, spanning from 2:20 PM to 2:38 PM.  The final version included functional file upload and deletion capabilities, tabbed navigation ('All', 'Your Files', "Writer's File"), and a filter modal for sorting.


The `ExpertCard.js` component, although present in the imports,  appears mostly unchanged and contains largely commented-out code throughout the log.  This suggests it was likely undergoing separate development or refactoring outside the scope of these commits.

The `CompletePayment.js` component, which was introduced later,  displays payment details with a partial payment indicator, outstanding balance, and a button for completing the payment.  Several revisions focused on improving the UI by replacing a placeholder SVG with an image for the payment icon and changing color schemes of the payment section.  The component initially used a custom SVG, then switched to an imported image `/landing-page/project/pay.svg`, and then finally to `/landing-page/project/payment.svg`.


In summary, the code changes primarily focused on enhancing the user interface and functionality of the project, notably adding file uploading, payment displays, and refining the visual presentation of different elements.  The development appears iterative, with features being progressively implemented and refined within each component.


## 5:01:25 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to `chat.js` between 4:11 PM and 4:49 PM on April 19, 2025.  These changes primarily involve replacing various UI elements (Smile, PaperclipIcon, Send icons) with `next/image` components for improved visual consistency and potentially better performance.  The specific images used are sourced from the `/landing-page/project/` directory (e.g., `/landing-page/project/avtar.svg`, `/landing-page/project/flag.svg`, etc.).

The initial version of `chat.js` (4/19/2025, 3:55:55 PM) displayed a chat interface using `lucide-react` icons.  Subsequent updates systematically replaced these with SVG images, resulting in a more unified visual style.  There were several intermediate commits adjusting image sizes and alt text.  The final commit (4/19/2025, 4:49:05 PM) made significant changes to styling, reducing font sizes and adding more responsive design elements through the use of Tailwind CSS classes with media queries (`sm`, `xs`, etc).  The code also underwent significant refactoring for better readability and maintainability as evidenced by the commenting out of the older code.

`ChooseExpert.js` was also modified twice on April 19, 2025 (3:56:18 PM and 3:56:57 PM). The first commit introduced a progress tracker and a structure for displaying tutor information.  The second commit involved adding the `Chat` component to the UI.  These changes show the addition of more features to the `ChooseExpert` component over time.  The addition of the `Chat` component suggests an integration of real-time communication into the expert selection process.
