# Activity Summary for 4/19/2025

## 10:20:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ExpertCard.js`, a React component, between 9:36 AM and 10:20 AM on April 19, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be adding a "Chat" button and displaying tutor's project completion statistics.

The earliest revisions (9:36 AM) show commented-out import statements, suggesting initial cleanup or restructuring. The subsequent revisions at 9:36:55 AM introduced a fully functional component.  This version included a modal for payment information,  responsive design elements using tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `[@media(min-width:426px)]`), and extensive use of inline styles for image sizing across different screen sizes.  The component renders information such as tutor name, image, badges, rating, reviews, bio, price, and a payment modal.

Later revisions between 9:42 AM and 9:59 AM show the component mostly unchanged, with a pattern of the entire code being commented out repeatedly.  This might indicate experimentation or debugging, possibly involving temporary disabling of sections for testing.

Finally, the last two changes (10:18 AM and 10:20 AM) also show the code commented out, leading to the same situation as previous revisions. These changes don't introduce any new features.  The most significant change occurred at 9:36:55 AM, adding the "Chat" button and  project completion statistics.  The large number of commented-out versions suggests a period of iterative development and testing.


## 11:20:20 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ExpertCard.js` between 10:20 AM and 11:18 AM on April 19, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged throughout these revisions; the file content is consistently a React component displaying tutor information (name, image, country flag, badges, rating, bio, price, etc.) and a modal explaining the payment process. The frequent timestamps suggest minor adjustments, likely related to styling or small bug fixes, rather than large-scale functional changes. There's a consistent use of tailwind CSS classes for styling, and responsive design is implemented using media queries (`@media`).  No significant structural alterations were made to the component's functionality.
