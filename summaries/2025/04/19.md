# Activity Summary for 4/19/2025

## 10:20:20 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ExpertCard.js`, a React component, between 9:36 AM and 10:20 AM on April 19, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be adding a "Chat" button and displaying tutor's project completion statistics.

The earliest revisions (9:36 AM) show commented-out import statements, suggesting initial cleanup or restructuring. The subsequent revisions at 9:36:55 AM introduced a fully functional component.  This version included a modal for payment information,  responsive design elements using tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `[@media(min-width:426px)]`), and extensive use of inline styles for image sizing across different screen sizes.  The component renders information such as tutor name, image, badges, rating, reviews, bio, price, and a payment modal.

Later revisions between 9:42 AM and 9:59 AM show the component mostly unchanged, with a pattern of the entire code being commented out repeatedly.  This might indicate experimentation or debugging, possibly involving temporary disabling of sections for testing.

Finally, the last two changes (10:18 AM and 10:20 AM) also show the code commented out, leading to the same situation as previous revisions. These changes don't introduce any new features.  The most significant change occurred at 9:36:55 AM, adding the "Chat" button and  project completion statistics.  The large number of commented-out versions suggests a period of iterative development and testing.


## 11:20:20 AM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ExpertCard.js` between 10:20 AM and 11:18 AM on April 19, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged throughout these revisions; the file content is consistently a React component displaying tutor information (name, image, country flag, badges, rating, bio, price, etc.) and a modal explaining the payment process. The frequent timestamps suggest minor adjustments, likely related to styling or small bug fixes, rather than large-scale functional changes. There's a consistent use of tailwind CSS classes for styling, and responsive design is implemented using media queries (`@media`).  No significant structural alterations were made to the component's functionality.


## 1:08:32 PM
The `HowItWorks.js` component was updated on April 19, 2025, at 12:09:52 PM.  The update primarily involved refinements to the layout and styling of a three-step "How It Works" section.  Specific changes include:

* **Improved Step Layout:** The steps were restructured using flexbox for better responsiveness across different screen sizes (md, lg, xl breakpoints are used).  Images were added to accompany each step, enhancing visual appeal.
* **Responsive Design:**  Numerous style adjustments were made to ensure proper rendering on different screen sizes, using media queries for various viewports.  Calculated widths and heights for images were adjusted based on screen size.
* **Styling Consistency:** Consistent styling was applied to elements such as buttons, step number boxes, and headings.  A color palette using hex codes (e.g., `#f5f3ef`, `#141624`, `#AF32D9`) was used throughout.
* **Image Updates:** Several SVG images were added (`/landing-page/homework/howitwork-2.svg`, `/landing-page/homework/howitwork-1.svg`, `/landing-page/homework/howitwork-3.svg` and others), replacing or supplementing existing ones. The images used throughout all use the `/landing-page` path. The `className` attributes of images were modified to improve the responsiveness and layout.
* **Content Clarification:**  The text within each step was refined for clarity, providing concise descriptions of each stage in the process.  The text content clearly explains steps involved in using the service, and button labels consistently encourage users to "Get Started."
* **Removed/Commented Code:** Several lines of code related to images (lines that previously drew arrows) appear to have been commented out, suggesting a simplification of the design.


The overall change reflects a significant visual and structural improvement to the component, aiming for enhanced user experience and better responsiveness across devices.
