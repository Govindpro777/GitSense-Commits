# Activity Summary for 4/1/2025

The `graphics.controller.js` file manages order creation and processing for a graphics design system.  Significant updates occurred on April 1st, 2025, at 10:11:16 AM.

The code defines several key functions:

* **`createOrder`**: This function handles new order creation. It validates inputs (requirements, dimensions, and images), uploads images using `localFileUpload`, finds an available graphics user using `findAvailableGraphicsUser`, creates a new order and corresponding Work Queue Item, schedules an order processing job using `agenda`, and sends a notification using `sendAssignmentNotification`.  Error handling includes transaction management using `mongoose.startSession()`.

* **`findAvailableGraphicsUser`**: This helper function uses an aggregation pipeline to find the least busy available graphics user based on `activeOrderCount`.

* **`sendAssignmentNotification`**: A placeholder function for sending notifications (currently only logs a message).

* **`calculatePriority`**: Calculates order priority based on the number of requirements.

* **`calculateEstimatedCompletion`**: Calculates an estimated completion time (currently 3 days from the current date).

* **`getPendingOrders`**: Retrieves pending orders (status: 'New' or 'InWorkQueue').

* **`reassignUnassignedOrders`**: Reassigns orders with `assignedTo: null` to available graphics users.  This also uses transaction management.

* **`getUserAssignedOrders`**: Retrieves orders assigned to a specific user.

* **`process-order` (Agenda Job)**: This function is executed by the agenda scheduler to process orders. It updates order and work queue item statuses, handles processing steps (via a missing `processOrderSteps` function), and includes error handling with transaction management.


The code extensively uses Mongoose for database interactions, Agenda for job scheduling, and Cloudinary for image uploading (though the Cloudinary function isn't fully shown).  A recurring pattern is the use of transactions to ensure data consistency across order creation and processing.  Error handling is implemented throughout the code using `try...catch` blocks.  The code shows a robust system for managing graphic design orders, including assigning orders to users, tracking progress, and handling potential errors.
