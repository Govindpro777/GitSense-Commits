# Activity Summary for 4/1/2025

## 10:42:46 AM
The `graphics.controller.js` file manages order creation and processing for a graphics design system.  Significant updates occurred on April 1st, 2025, at 10:11:16 AM.

The code defines several key functions:

* **`createOrder`**: This function handles new order creation. It validates inputs (requirements, dimensions, and images), uploads images using `localFileUpload`, finds an available graphics user using `findAvailableGraphicsUser`, creates a new order and corresponding Work Queue Item, schedules an order processing job using `agenda`, and sends a notification using `sendAssignmentNotification`.  Error handling includes transaction management using `mongoose.startSession()`.

* **`findAvailableGraphicsUser`**: This helper function uses an aggregation pipeline to find the least busy available graphics user based on `activeOrderCount`.

* **`sendAssignmentNotification`**: A placeholder function for sending notifications (currently only logs a message).

* **`calculatePriority`**: Calculates order priority based on the number of requirements.

* **`calculateEstimatedCompletion`**: Calculates an estimated completion time (currently 3 days from the current date).

* **`getPendingOrders`**: Retrieves pending orders (status: 'New' or 'InWorkQueue').

* **`reassignUnassignedOrders`**: Reassigns orders with `assignedTo: null` to available graphics users.  This also uses transaction management.

* **`getUserAssignedOrders`**: Retrieves orders assigned to a specific user.

* **`process-order` (Agenda Job)**: This function is executed by the agenda scheduler to process orders. It updates order and work queue item statuses, handles processing steps (via a missing `processOrderSteps` function), and includes error handling with transaction management.


The code extensively uses Mongoose for database interactions, Agenda for job scheduling, and Cloudinary for image uploading (though the Cloudinary function isn't fully shown).  A recurring pattern is the use of transactions to ensure data consistency across order creation and processing.  Error handling is implemented throughout the code using `try...catch` blocks.  The code shows a robust system for managing graphic design orders, including assigning orders to users, tracking progress, and handling potential errors.


## 11:40:08 AM
The log shows the development of a meme generator using React.  Initially, the `page.js` file contained only a simple "Hello World" message. Between 10:57 AM and 10:59 AM, significant changes were made, fetching meme data from `https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes` using `useEffect` and `fetch`.  The fetched meme data was logged to the console, then used to populate the page with meme names.

Around 11:00 AM, a `selectedMeme` state variable was added to manage the currently selected meme. There were several minor revisions during this time, primarily correcting the way the selected meme was handled (initially setting `selectedMeme` to the entire memes array instead of a single meme).  At 11:01 AM, some minor styling changes were introduced. Finally, at 11:30 AM, a major update transformed the application into a functional meme selector with a dropdown, allowing users to choose from the available meme templates. The selected meme's image then displays below the dropdown, utilizing styling with classes like `min-h-screen`, `bg-gray-900`, etc.  The final version, remaining unchanged for the last few entries, displays the meme using an `<img>` tag. There were no other file paths modified in this log.


## 11:42:44 AM
The log shows a single significant code update to `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal CRM\Metal_CRM-backend\models\workQueueItem.model.js` at 4/1/2025, 11:02:56 AM.  This update modifies the `workQueueItem` Mongoose schema.  Key changes include:

* **Enhanced Status Management:** The schema now includes more robust status tracking for work queue items (Pending, InProgress, Completed, Failed, Paused) and integrates with an `Order` model, automatically updating the order's status based on the work queue item's status using a `statusMapping`.  Error handling and retry mechanisms are added via `logError` method and `retryCount` field.

* **Priority and Assignment:**  Work queue items can be assigned to users (`assignedTo`) and have a priority level (`priority`).

* **Processing Steps:**  A `processingSteps` array allows tracking individual steps within a work queue item, each with its own status, assigned user, and timestamps.

* **Overdue Check:** A virtual `isOverdue` property is added to easily determine if a work queue item has surpassed its estimated completion time.

* **Querying:** A static method `findNextPendingItem` is implemented to efficiently retrieve the highest priority pending work queue item.

The older commented-out code suggests a previous, simpler version of the schema with fewer features and less sophisticated status management.  The updated schema exhibits a more mature and feature-rich design better suited for managing complex workflows.


## 12:57:07 PM
The log shows a single code change on April 1st, 2025, at 12:14:51 PM.  This change involves the `order.model.js` file within a MongoDB schema for orders.  The schema defines fields for `orderId` (unique String), `customer` (ObjectId referencing the Customer model), `requirements`, `dimensions` (both Strings), `status` (String with an enumerated list of order statuses), `image` (array of Strings), `assignedTo`, `approvedBy`, and `createdBy` (all ObjectIds referencing the User model), and a `created` field storing the creation date as a formatted string.  The schema uses timestamps and the `Order` model is exported using Mongoose.  The key update is the comprehensive definition of the order schema, establishing relationships with other models (Customer and User) and defining various attributes of an order.


## 1:56:59 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\New folder\app\layout.tsx` on April 1st, 2025, between 1:26 PM and 1:27 PM.  The primary change involves the `metadata` object within the `layout.tsx` file. Specifically, the description field "Connect with experts for your projects and appointments" was removed from the `metadata` object in the second and third edits.  The rest of the code remained consistent across all three revisions.  The changes appear to be minor modifications focused on the application's metadata.


## 3:57:01 PM
The log shows two main React component files updated on April 1st, 2025.

**`ProjectCard.tsx` (3:48:25 PM):** This file defines a reusable component to display project information.  It includes detailed styling using Tailwind CSS classes for visual presentation.  The component accepts a `ProjectCardProps` interface which includes project status (with various status types defined), deadline, ID, title, category, files, bid details (handling both regular bids and expert bids), and optional ratings.  The status is displayed using a colored badge, dynamically determined based on the project status.  The bid section is conditionally rendered based on the type of bid (regular or expert).  The component uses `next/image` for image display.  Significant effort is dedicated to creating a visually appealing and informative card.

**`ActiveProjects.tsx` (3:55:24 PM):** This file renders a page showing a list of active projects. It uses the `ProjectCard` component to display individual project details, fetching data from a hardcoded `projects` array.  The page includes functionality for filtering projects based on status using tab buttons, a search bar with a Lucide-React `Search` icon, and subject filtering.  The page also displays a notification section (with a placeholder for notifications) and a calendar component.  The layout uses Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.  The component uses several image imports from the `public` directory.  The styling heavily uses Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design and visual consistency. The filtering logic is implemented using the `activeTab` state variable and the `.filter()` method on the `projects` array.  The time difference between updates to the two files suggests they are related.


## 7:40:42 PM
The Orders.jsx component, updated on 4/1/2025 at 6:29:46 PM, displays and manages orders.  Significant changes include updates to image preview handling and the addition of order deletion functionality.

The component fetches orders using a backend API (`/api/v1/admin/getOrders`) and displays them in a table with columns for order ID, customer, status, assigned user, creation date, requirements, and images.  Order status is color-coded.  A search bar and filter by status are implemented.

A "New Order" button opens a modal (`CreateNewOrder`) for creating new orders.  An "Edit" button opens another modal (`EditOrder`) to modify existing orders, while a "Trash" button deletes an order via a DELETE request to (`/api/v1/admin/deleteOrder/{orderId}`). The delete functionality includes a confirmation prompt.

The image preview functionality was reworked.  Instead of directly using the image data, it now constructs a URL using the backend base URL (obtained via `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL`) concatenated with the image path obtained from the API response. A loading indicator is displayed while fetching the image.

The code utilizes several React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`) for managing state and fetching data.  Error handling is included for API calls, displaying an alert on failure.  The component utilizes the `lucide-react` library for icons.


## 11:32:39 PM
The log shows modifications to frontend components (`Orders.jsx`, `CreateNewOrder.jsx`, `EditOrder.jsx`) and a backend `.env` file between 10:50 PM and 11:31 PM on April 1st, 2025.

The `Orders.jsx` file underwent two updates.  The first update (10:50 PM) established the basic functionality for displaying, creating, editing, and deleting orders.  It includes features like search, filtering by order status, and image preview.  The second update (11:06 PM) appears to be a minor revision with no functional changes detected in the provided diff.

The `EditOrder.jsx` component was significantly revised across multiple commits. Initially (11:07 PM), it provided basic order editing functionality. Subsequent commits (11:07 PM, 11:09 PM, 11:12 PM, 11:15 PM, 11:16 PM, 11:17 PM) refined the component's data handling, particularly concerning the `customerName` field which changed from using  `data.order.name` to `data.order.customer.name` and  handling of user assignment with improved UI.  The final version (11:24 PM) shows a complete version of the component. A commented-out section suggests earlier iterations might have included different UI elements or functionality.

The `CreateNewOrder.jsx` component went through a series of changes, starting as a commented-out template (11:18 PM). The final version (11:31 PM) features a more refined and complete implementation, incorporating image uploading and improved styling for creating new orders. The updates include a much improved UI/UX with better styling and labels.


Throughout the frontend components, there's a consistent pattern of using `fetch` with authorization headers (`Authorization: `${token}`) to interact with a backend API (indicated by the `BASE_URL` variable derived from `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL`).  The components also manage loading states using `useState` and employ error handling within `try...catch` blocks.

The `.env` file (10:51 PM) contains environment variables, including database credentials (MONGODB_URL), JWT secret (JWT_SECRET), Cloudinary configuration (CLOUD_NAME, API_KEY, API_SECRET), and client URL (CLIENT_URL).  This file was not changed after the first commit.
