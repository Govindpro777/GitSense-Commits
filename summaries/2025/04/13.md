# Activity Summary for 4/13/2025

## 12:13:52 AM
The log shows updates to frontend and backend components of a user management system.

**Metal-frontend (src/pages/UserManagement.jsx):**  This file, representing a React component for user management,  underwent multiple revisions between April 12th and 13th, 2025.  All revisions show commented-out code, suggesting iterative development or debugging. The component displays a table of users, allowing for searching, filtering by role, and deleting users.  The commented-out code includes functionality for adding users through a modal. The UI uses a Tailwind CSS-like styling.

**Metal-backend (controller/user.controller.js):** This file contains the backend controllers for user-related operations.  Two revisions occurred close together on April 12th, 2025 (11:38:01 PM and 11:39:16 PM). The first revision includes  `signUp`, `createAccount`, `login`, `getUser`, `changePassword`, `getAllUsers`, and `deleteUser` functions. The second revision removes the `changePassword` function, implying it was either removed or moved elsewhere.  The controllers handle user registration, login, user data retrieval, password changes (initially, then removed), fetching all users (with authorization checks for SuperAdmin or Admin), and user deletion (with SuperAdmin-only access).  The code uses bcrypt for password hashing and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.  Email functionality using nodemailer is included for sending welcome emails upon user creation.

**Metal-backend (routes/user.routes.js):** This file defines the API routes for user management. It maps HTTP methods (POST, GET, DELETE, PUT) to the corresponding controller functions. Two nearly identical revisions occurred on April 12th, 2025 around 11:40 PM, indicating potential minor corrections or version control actions without any functional changes.


**Metal-frontend (src/pages/PreviewCadfiles.jsx):** This component, added on April 12th, 2025 at 11:41:06 PM, handles the preview and removal of uploaded files (images and potentially CAD files). It displays a grid of file previews, showing filenames, file icons, preview buttons (for images), and remove buttons. The component dynamically renders the appropriate file icon based on file type and utilizes a function to shorten long filenames for better display.


In summary, the code changes represent a significant update to a user management system. The backend changes focus on user authentication, authorization, and data management, while the frontend updates provide a user interface for viewing and interacting with user data and file previews.  The commented-out sections in the frontend code suggest ongoing development or temporary disabling of features. The multiple, nearly identical revisions in the routing file suggest minor corrections or version control processes.
