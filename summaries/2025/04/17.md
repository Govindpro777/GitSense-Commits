# Activity Summary for 4/17/2025

## 12:23:31 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, focusing on the styling and layout of components related to choosing and displaying expert tutors.

The `ChooseExpert.js` file underwent several minor updates between 11:24 PM and 11:32 PM on April 16, 2025. These changes primarily involved adjustments to the spacing (`gap` classes) within the UI, and minor text formatting alterations in the `Subject Area` and `Project Type` sections.  No significant functional changes were introduced during this time. A more substantial change happened at 11:32 PM, updating the font size consistency for certain text elements.

The `ExpertCard.js` file saw more extensive modifications between 11:34 PM and 12:22 AM on April 16 and 17, 2025.  Initial changes involved refactoring the layout of the `TutorCard` component, particularly the placement of the price and buttons, moving towards a more centralized arrangement.  Between 11:40 PM and 11:55 PM, there was a significant restructuring of the right-hand section of the card.  The changes included simplifying the layout, adjusting text alignment (`text-center`, `justify-between`), and making the heart icon consistently visible on screens larger than 426px. The final adjustments, around 12:15 AM on April 17, focused on minor spacing and padding refinements and repositioning of the heart icon.  This suggests a continuous effort to improve the visual appeal and user experience of the tutor cards. A recurring element across all revisions of this file is the extensive use of responsive design (media queries using `[@media(min-width:426px)]`) to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
