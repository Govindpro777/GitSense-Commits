# Activity Summary for 4/17/2025

## 12:23:31 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, focusing on the styling and layout of components related to choosing and displaying expert tutors.

The `ChooseExpert.js` file underwent several minor updates between 11:24 PM and 11:32 PM on April 16, 2025. These changes primarily involved adjustments to the spacing (`gap` classes) within the UI, and minor text formatting alterations in the `Subject Area` and `Project Type` sections.  No significant functional changes were introduced during this time. A more substantial change happened at 11:32 PM, updating the font size consistency for certain text elements.

The `ExpertCard.js` file saw more extensive modifications between 11:34 PM and 12:22 AM on April 16 and 17, 2025.  Initial changes involved refactoring the layout of the `TutorCard` component, particularly the placement of the price and buttons, moving towards a more centralized arrangement.  Between 11:40 PM and 11:55 PM, there was a significant restructuring of the right-hand section of the card.  The changes included simplifying the layout, adjusting text alignment (`text-center`, `justify-between`), and making the heart icon consistently visible on screens larger than 426px. The final adjustments, around 12:15 AM on April 17, focused on minor spacing and padding refinements and repositioning of the heart icon.  This suggests a continuous effort to improve the visual appeal and user experience of the tutor cards. A recurring element across all revisions of this file is the extensive use of responsive design (media queries using `[@media(min-width:426px)]`) to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.


## 1:01:11 PM
The log shows several modifications to the `ExpertCard.js` and `UploadFiles.js` components, and extensive changes to the `WelcomePage.js` component.  All changes are within the `src/components/landingPage` directory of a React frontend application.

**ExpertCard.js:**  Multiple edits occurred between 11:06 AM and 11:15 AM on April 17, 2025. These revisions seem focused on adjusting the layout and responsiveness of the card, particularly the positioning of the heart icon (favorite button) across different screen sizes. The code itself is highly repetitive with many instances of repeated styling for different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS classes.  The final changes resulted in the heart icon being positioned in the upper right corner, visible on screens above 426px and using the `absolute` positioning. The `mb-` (margin-bottom) property on the main div was changed from `z` to `3` indicating a change in spacing or z-index.

**UploadFiles.js:** A single update happened at 12:37 PM on April 17, 2025.  This commit introduced a fully functional file upload component with features like file listing, individual file removal (`handleRemoveFile`),  multiple file selection (`handleFileUpload`), tabbed filtering (`activeTab`), and sorting (`sortBy`). The component utilizes custom `FileItem` and `TabButton` components and leverages `lucide-react`, `GlobalPopup`, and `js-cookie`.  The initial state includes four sample files.

**WelcomePage.js:**  Several revisions occurred between 12:39 PM and 12:46 PM on April 17, 2025. The component appears to be a modal form for users to input details for a new request, including title, content, file upload, type of assignment, subject, word count, deadline (using `@mantine/dates`), and budget.  The budget is dynamically fetched using a `fetchBudgetSuggestion` function that makes a POST request to `/api/homework/budget-suggestion`.  The function uses a debounce mechanism with a 500ms delay to prevent excessive API calls. Changes include updating the state variable `date` to not have a default value and adding a `DateTimePicker` component to the form.  The code uses several images (`Image` component) for icons and illustrations, relying on local paths within the "/landing-page" directory.  The component is also integrated with a `GlobalPopup` component to display the form and leverages React's `useState` and `useRef` hooks along with `useAuth` and `Cookies` for user authentication and data management.
