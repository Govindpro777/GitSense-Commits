# Activity Summary for 4/17/2025

## 12:23:31 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, focusing on the styling and layout of components related to choosing and displaying expert tutors.

The `ChooseExpert.js` file underwent several minor updates between 11:24 PM and 11:32 PM on April 16, 2025. These changes primarily involved adjustments to the spacing (`gap` classes) within the UI, and minor text formatting alterations in the `Subject Area` and `Project Type` sections.  No significant functional changes were introduced during this time. A more substantial change happened at 11:32 PM, updating the font size consistency for certain text elements.

The `ExpertCard.js` file saw more extensive modifications between 11:34 PM and 12:22 AM on April 16 and 17, 2025.  Initial changes involved refactoring the layout of the `TutorCard` component, particularly the placement of the price and buttons, moving towards a more centralized arrangement.  Between 11:40 PM and 11:55 PM, there was a significant restructuring of the right-hand section of the card.  The changes included simplifying the layout, adjusting text alignment (`text-center`, `justify-between`), and making the heart icon consistently visible on screens larger than 426px. The final adjustments, around 12:15 AM on April 17, focused on minor spacing and padding refinements and repositioning of the heart icon.  This suggests a continuous effort to improve the visual appeal and user experience of the tutor cards. A recurring element across all revisions of this file is the extensive use of responsive design (media queries using `[@media(min-width:426px)]`) to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.


## 1:01:11 PM
The log shows several modifications to the `ExpertCard.js` and `UploadFiles.js` components, and extensive changes to the `WelcomePage.js` component.  All changes are within the `src/components/landingPage` directory of a React frontend application.

**ExpertCard.js:**  Multiple edits occurred between 11:06 AM and 11:15 AM on April 17, 2025. These revisions seem focused on adjusting the layout and responsiveness of the card, particularly the positioning of the heart icon (favorite button) across different screen sizes. The code itself is highly repetitive with many instances of repeated styling for different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS classes.  The final changes resulted in the heart icon being positioned in the upper right corner, visible on screens above 426px and using the `absolute` positioning. The `mb-` (margin-bottom) property on the main div was changed from `z` to `3` indicating a change in spacing or z-index.

**UploadFiles.js:** A single update happened at 12:37 PM on April 17, 2025.  This commit introduced a fully functional file upload component with features like file listing, individual file removal (`handleRemoveFile`),  multiple file selection (`handleFileUpload`), tabbed filtering (`activeTab`), and sorting (`sortBy`). The component utilizes custom `FileItem` and `TabButton` components and leverages `lucide-react`, `GlobalPopup`, and `js-cookie`.  The initial state includes four sample files.

**WelcomePage.js:**  Several revisions occurred between 12:39 PM and 12:46 PM on April 17, 2025. The component appears to be a modal form for users to input details for a new request, including title, content, file upload, type of assignment, subject, word count, deadline (using `@mantine/dates`), and budget.  The budget is dynamically fetched using a `fetchBudgetSuggestion` function that makes a POST request to `/api/homework/budget-suggestion`.  The function uses a debounce mechanism with a 500ms delay to prevent excessive API calls. Changes include updating the state variable `date` to not have a default value and adding a `DateTimePicker` component to the form.  The code uses several images (`Image` component) for icons and illustrations, relying on local paths within the "/landing-page" directory.  The component is also integrated with a `GlobalPopup` component to display the form and leverages React's `useState` and `useRef` hooks along with `useAuth` and `Cookies` for user authentication and data management.


## 2:01:10 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `How-It-Works.js` on April 17th, 2025.  The initial revisions (1:01 PM) involved the structural changes within the component, primarily focusing on the layout and styling using Tailwind CSS. The component displays a "How It Works" section with three steps, each containing a step number, descriptive text, an illustrative image (`/landing-page/homework/howitwork-*.svg`), and a "Get Started" button.

Later revisions (starting around 1:46 PM) centered on adjustments to the positioning of decorative navigation arrows (`/landing-page/line1.svg` and `/landing-page/line2.svg`).  The positioning of these images was repeatedly modified, indicated by numerous changes in their CSS `className` attributes, specifically the `left`, `top`, `bottom`, and responsive values.  There were also a few minor revisions adjusting the `gap` property between elements in the steps.  The final revisions appear to settle on a specific placement for these navigation arrows, using `calc()` for responsive design.  There was also a brief period where there were two or more of the same navigation arrows before being removed back to the final two.


## 2:13:32 PM
The log shows configuration changes within an `.env` file.  Because this file contains sensitive information (database credentials, API keys, email passwords), a detailed summary of its contents will not be provided.  However, it's evident that the file stores environment variables for a backend application, including port settings, database connection details, JWT secret, cloudinary configurations, email credentials, and client URLs.  The timestamps indicate a single modification on April 17th, 2025, at 1:22:57 PM.  There is evidence of commented-out email credentials, suggesting a change in the email account used by the application at some point.


## 3:13:34 PM
The `Navbar.jsx` component was updated on April 17, 2025, at 2:43:22 PM.  The update significantly enhanced the component's functionality by adding real-time notification handling using sockets.  The component now fetches user details using an API call after retrieving a token from local storage.

Specific changes include:

* **Socket Integration:**  The component now uses custom hooks (`useSocket` and `useSocketEvents`) to connect to a socket and handle incoming messages ("message" and "assignment" events).  Received messages trigger both a visual notification and a `react-hot-toast` notification.  The socket connection status is visually indicated.

* **Notification System:** A notification dropdown displays incoming messages with timestamps.  The dropdown dynamically updates and includes a count of unread notifications.  Clicking outside the dropdown closes it.  A "View all" button is displayed if notifications exist.

* **User Information:**  The component fetches user details via an API call (`/api/v1/auth/getUser`) using the token from local storage and displays the user's first initial. Error handling is included for failed API calls.

* **UI Improvements:** The UI has been enhanced with styling and visual indicators for the socket connection status and notification count.  A mobile menu button has been added using `Bars3Icon`. The user's initial is displayed in a circular avatar.

The code uses several external libraries including `react-router-dom`, `@heroicons/react/24/outline`, `axios`, `react-hot-toast`, and `moment`.  The use of `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` suggests a build process leveraging environment variables.  The overall update reflects a substantial improvement in user experience by adding interactive real-time features.


## 4:07:25 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `How-It-Works.js` between 3:10 PM and 3:31 PM on April 17, 2025, primarily focusing on styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  The changes involve tweaking spacing (`gap`, `mb`, `mt`, `px`, `py`), element dimensions (`w`, `h`), and responsive design adjustments (`md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`).  A commented-out section of code related to image positioning was also present, suggesting experimentation with layout.  The most significant change during this period involved refining the positioning of navigation arrows (`line1.svg`, `line2.svg`) and these adjustments continued until  3:31 PM.  After that, between 3:36 PM and 3:54 PM, modifications were made to `ProjectDetails.js`, adding an `UploadFiles` component and implementing functionality to open and close an upload modal.  Finally, between 3:38 PM and 3:54 PM edits to `ChooseExpert.js` were made to incorporate a progress tracker using a `steps` array and updating styling for better responsiveness. The `ChooseExpert.js` file also integrated the `ProjectDetails` and `ExpertCard` components.  The `UploadFiles.js` component underwent several revisions between 3:46 PM and 4:02 PM, primarily concerning styling and prop handling, updating its import path for `GlobalPopup` and adding an `Image` import.  All these changes suggest a focus on improving the UI/UX of a landing page and enhancing its functionality.


## 5:07:27 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `UploadFiles.js` between 4:13 PM and 5:07 PM on April 17, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the UI/UX of a file upload component,  shifting from using SVGs for icons to using images from the `/landing-page/project/` directory (png.svg, download.svg, attach.svg).  There's also an `/api/placeholder/32/32` image used for user avatars.

Specific changes include:

* **4:13 PM:** Initial commit showing a functional file upload component with SVG icons for file type, size, and user indicators.  The component includes file listing, filtering ("All," "Your Files," "Writer's File"), and sorting ("All Files," "Date," "Size").

* **Between 4:15 PM and 4:18 PM:**  Multiple commits with minimal changes; primarily the code was refactored and formatted.  The `UploadFiles` component is modified to accept `isOpen` and `onClose` props. The  `GlobalPopup` component is used to render the file upload interface.

* **4:17 PM:**  The most significant change occurs here. SVG icons are replaced with images.

* **4:18 PM - 4:19 PM:** Further styling changes are made, adjusting text colors (`text-[#A414D5]`, `text-[#640D51]`) and font sizes (`text-[14px]`, `text-[18px]`).


* **4:30 PM - 4:42 PM:** More refinements to styling and layout, including padding and sizing adjustments.  The file icon Image path is updated in a couple of commits.  The width of the UploadFiles container is set to 1000px.


* **4:49 PM:** A substantial restructuring happens, moving towards a more component-based approach.  A `SortPopup` component is introduced.  The `use client` directive is added, indicating a client-side component in a Next.js application.

* **4:51 PM - 5:07 PM:** Minor refinements and corrections to styling, text sizes, font weights, and spacing, showing iterative improvements to the UI. The `GlobalPopup` component receives styling updates (max-width and max-height are specified) and a border is added to show the errors.  The `useCallback` hook is removed in favor of regular function calls for `handleRemoveFile` and `handleFileUpload`.  The `TabButton` component styling is updated.  The file list spacing is adjusted.

Throughout the process, the core functionality of file uploading, removal, filtering, and sorting remains consistent. The major focus is on improving the visual presentation and organization of the component, using images instead of SVGs and refining the styling with tailwindcss.


## 6:07:28 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `UploadFiles.js` between 5:08 PM and 5:21 PM on April 17, 2025, focusing primarily on UI refinements.  Changes include adding borders (initially red, then removed), adjusting spacing with Tailwind CSS classes like `gap`, `py`, and `mt`, and modifying the size and styling of various UI elements (images, buttons, text).  The `FileItem` component received updates to its layout and the inclusion of an avatar image.  The most significant visual change was the replacement of the file type dropdown with a checkbox list for filtering files.  Finally, between 5:38 PM and 6:05 PM, `ExpertCard.js` underwent numerous revisions.  These changes centered around adding a modal explaining how the platform works, improving the styling and layout of the tutor cards and adding a box-shadow to the modal.  There's a consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes throughout both files, and the changes suggest an iterative process of UI development and improvement.


## 7:07:24 PM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `ExpertCard.js` and `UploadFiles.js`.

`ExpertCard.js` underwent several revisions between 6:08 PM and 6:09 PM on April 17th, 2025.  The primary change involved adding a `modalRef` and an `useEffect` hook to manage a modal's closing behavior when clicking outside of it.  The component displays tutor information (name, image, badges, ratings, bio etc.), and includes interactive elements such as a heart icon for favorites and buttons to hire or chat with the tutor.  The modal details a payment plan.  No other significant structural changes are apparent in the code.

`UploadFiles.js` was modified extensively between 6:22 PM and 6:37 PM on April 17th, 2025.  Initially, it was a simple file upload component showing a list of files, allowing file addition and removal. It featured tabs ('All', 'Your Files', "Writer's File") and a dropdown to sort files.  Later revisions (starting around 6:27 PM) replaced the sort dropdown with a custom filter modal, which is shown/hidden using state variables and `useEffect` for click-outside handling. The filter modal is implemented using a dropdown-like list of options ('All Files', 'Documents', 'Images', 'Video') with a count next to each option.  The  final changes around 6:35 PM involved styling updates, primarily changing the color of some text elements from gray-800 to #6B7B93 and adding an avatar to the file list.  A minor icon change occurred on the filter button  from an arrow icon to another.  There is no actual filtering functionality.


## 10:01:26 PM
The log shows multiple updates to frontend and backend components between 9:02 PM and 9:34 PM on April 17, 2025.

The `admin.routes.js` file (backend) was updated at 9:02 PM to include numerous API routes related to admin functionalities.  These routes handle leads, customers, orders, graphics, display, and accounts, using middleware for authentication and authorization.  Several routes manage orders, including creation, update, deletion, and assignment, making significant changes to the order management system.  Additional routes were added for file management (download, download-all, download-all-type, getFilesByOrder), suggesting an enhancement to the file handling capability within the application.

The `UserManagement.jsx` file (frontend) at 9:04 PM reflects a user management page that fetches, filters, adds, edits, and deletes users.  It uses a search bar and role filter for improved user management.  Error handling for password changes is included.

The `Orders.jsx` file (frontend) was updated at 9:06 PM. This file manages the display and interaction with orders. Key changes include adding features for searching, filtering by status, creating, editing, and deleting orders, previewing order images, and incorporating socket.io for real-time status updates, along with a modal for viewing order details.

The `Logs.jsx` component (frontend), updated multiple times between 9:17 PM and 9:34 PM, displays order logs.  Initial versions were commented out.  Later versions improved the logging display with features to show a detailed timeline, specific icons for different log types, and image previews for before and after image updates. The final version added a viewMode switch between timeline and detailed view.

The `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` component (frontend) underwent multiple revisions between 9:19 PM and 9:34 PM, evolving from a commented-out basic component to a functional one with tabs for details, files, and logs. It allows the downloading of files individually or in bulk. The component handles the fetching and displaying of file data along with different download options for images and CAD files and integrates the `Logs` and `AccountAssign` components.  A prominent change involves integrating the assignment of orders to display users and displaying appropriate success or error messages.


A recurring pattern across the frontend files is the use of Tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide React for icons.  Also, most frontend components make use of axios or fetch for API calls and include error handling and loading indicators.  The backend relies heavily on Express.js for routing and various controllers for handling business logic.
