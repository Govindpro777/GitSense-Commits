# Activity Summary for 4/17/2025

## 12:23:31 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, focusing on the styling and layout of components related to choosing and displaying expert tutors.

The `ChooseExpert.js` file underwent several minor updates between 11:24 PM and 11:32 PM on April 16, 2025. These changes primarily involved adjustments to the spacing (`gap` classes) within the UI, and minor text formatting alterations in the `Subject Area` and `Project Type` sections.  No significant functional changes were introduced during this time. A more substantial change happened at 11:32 PM, updating the font size consistency for certain text elements.

The `ExpertCard.js` file saw more extensive modifications between 11:34 PM and 12:22 AM on April 16 and 17, 2025.  Initial changes involved refactoring the layout of the `TutorCard` component, particularly the placement of the price and buttons, moving towards a more centralized arrangement.  Between 11:40 PM and 11:55 PM, there was a significant restructuring of the right-hand section of the card.  The changes included simplifying the layout, adjusting text alignment (`text-center`, `justify-between`), and making the heart icon consistently visible on screens larger than 426px. The final adjustments, around 12:15 AM on April 17, focused on minor spacing and padding refinements and repositioning of the heart icon.  This suggests a continuous effort to improve the visual appeal and user experience of the tutor cards. A recurring element across all revisions of this file is the extensive use of responsive design (media queries using `[@media(min-width:426px)]`) to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.


## 1:01:11 PM
The log shows several modifications to the `ExpertCard.js` and `UploadFiles.js` components, and extensive changes to the `WelcomePage.js` component.  All changes are within the `src/components/landingPage` directory of a React frontend application.

**ExpertCard.js:**  Multiple edits occurred between 11:06 AM and 11:15 AM on April 17, 2025. These revisions seem focused on adjusting the layout and responsiveness of the card, particularly the positioning of the heart icon (favorite button) across different screen sizes. The code itself is highly repetitive with many instances of repeated styling for different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS classes.  The final changes resulted in the heart icon being positioned in the upper right corner, visible on screens above 426px and using the `absolute` positioning. The `mb-` (margin-bottom) property on the main div was changed from `z` to `3` indicating a change in spacing or z-index.

**UploadFiles.js:** A single update happened at 12:37 PM on April 17, 2025.  This commit introduced a fully functional file upload component with features like file listing, individual file removal (`handleRemoveFile`),  multiple file selection (`handleFileUpload`), tabbed filtering (`activeTab`), and sorting (`sortBy`). The component utilizes custom `FileItem` and `TabButton` components and leverages `lucide-react`, `GlobalPopup`, and `js-cookie`.  The initial state includes four sample files.

**WelcomePage.js:**  Several revisions occurred between 12:39 PM and 12:46 PM on April 17, 2025. The component appears to be a modal form for users to input details for a new request, including title, content, file upload, type of assignment, subject, word count, deadline (using `@mantine/dates`), and budget.  The budget is dynamically fetched using a `fetchBudgetSuggestion` function that makes a POST request to `/api/homework/budget-suggestion`.  The function uses a debounce mechanism with a 500ms delay to prevent excessive API calls. Changes include updating the state variable `date` to not have a default value and adding a `DateTimePicker` component to the form.  The code uses several images (`Image` component) for icons and illustrations, relying on local paths within the "/landing-page" directory.  The component is also integrated with a `GlobalPopup` component to display the form and leverages React's `useState` and `useRef` hooks along with `useAuth` and `Cookies` for user authentication and data management.


## 2:01:10 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `How-It-Works.js` on April 17th, 2025.  The initial revisions (1:01 PM) involved the structural changes within the component, primarily focusing on the layout and styling using Tailwind CSS. The component displays a "How It Works" section with three steps, each containing a step number, descriptive text, an illustrative image (`/landing-page/homework/howitwork-*.svg`), and a "Get Started" button.

Later revisions (starting around 1:46 PM) centered on adjustments to the positioning of decorative navigation arrows (`/landing-page/line1.svg` and `/landing-page/line2.svg`).  The positioning of these images was repeatedly modified, indicated by numerous changes in their CSS `className` attributes, specifically the `left`, `top`, `bottom`, and responsive values.  There were also a few minor revisions adjusting the `gap` property between elements in the steps.  The final revisions appear to settle on a specific placement for these navigation arrows, using `calc()` for responsive design.  There was also a brief period where there were two or more of the same navigation arrows before being removed back to the final two.


## 2:13:32 PM
The log shows configuration changes within an `.env` file.  Because this file contains sensitive information (database credentials, API keys, email passwords), a detailed summary of its contents will not be provided.  However, it's evident that the file stores environment variables for a backend application, including port settings, database connection details, JWT secret, cloudinary configurations, email credentials, and client URLs.  The timestamps indicate a single modification on April 17th, 2025, at 1:22:57 PM.  There is evidence of commented-out email credentials, suggesting a change in the email account used by the application at some point.


## 3:13:34 PM
The `Navbar.jsx` component was updated on April 17, 2025, at 2:43:22 PM.  The update significantly enhanced the component's functionality by adding real-time notification handling using sockets.  The component now fetches user details using an API call after retrieving a token from local storage.

Specific changes include:

* **Socket Integration:**  The component now uses custom hooks (`useSocket` and `useSocketEvents`) to connect to a socket and handle incoming messages ("message" and "assignment" events).  Received messages trigger both a visual notification and a `react-hot-toast` notification.  The socket connection status is visually indicated.

* **Notification System:** A notification dropdown displays incoming messages with timestamps.  The dropdown dynamically updates and includes a count of unread notifications.  Clicking outside the dropdown closes it.  A "View all" button is displayed if notifications exist.

* **User Information:**  The component fetches user details via an API call (`/api/v1/auth/getUser`) using the token from local storage and displays the user's first initial. Error handling is included for failed API calls.

* **UI Improvements:** The UI has been enhanced with styling and visual indicators for the socket connection status and notification count.  A mobile menu button has been added using `Bars3Icon`. The user's initial is displayed in a circular avatar.

The code uses several external libraries including `react-router-dom`, `@heroicons/react/24/outline`, `axios`, `react-hot-toast`, and `moment`.  The use of `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` suggests a build process leveraging environment variables.  The overall update reflects a substantial improvement in user experience by adding interactive real-time features.
