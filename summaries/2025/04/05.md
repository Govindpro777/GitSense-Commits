# Activity Summary for 4/5/2025

## 12:38:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `GraphicsOrder.jsx` file between 12:08 AM and 12:25 AM on April 5th, 2025.  The code implements a component to display and manage graphics orders.  No changes were made to the functionality across the revisions.  All three revisions are identical. The component fetches order data from an API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/assigned`), displays the orders in a table, and allows users to update the status of each order via a dropdown menu. The component handles loading and error states, provides visual feedback for status updates, and refreshes the order list after a status change.  The status options are hardcoded as ["Pending", "InProgress", "Completed", "Failed", "Paused"].  Image display is also included, pulling image URLs from the API response and prepending the `BASE_URL` obtained from the environment variable `VITE_BASE_URL`.


## 1:39:02 AM
The log shows several code changes across frontend and backend components of a CRM system, primarily focusing on order management.  The most significant changes occur between 12:40 AM and 1:30 AM on April 5th, 2025.

**`graphics.controller.js` (Backend):** This file underwent multiple revisions, all related to order management functionalities.  The changes include:

* **Order creation:** The `createOrder` function was enhanced to handle local file uploads using `localFileUpload` from the `ImageUploader` utility. It now allows for optional pre-assignment of orders to specific graphics users.  The function uses transactions to ensure atomicity in database operations, involving both `Order` and `WorkQueue` models.  Order processing is scheduled using the `agenda` library.

* **Order retrieval and reassignment:** Functions `getPendingOrders`, `reassignUnassignedOrders`, and `getUserAssignedOrders` were added or modified for retrieving pending, unassigned, and user-assigned orders respectively, with proper population of related data.

* **Helper functions:** Several helper functions were added to streamline the logic, such as `findAvailableGraphicsUser` (for finding an available graphics user), `sendAssignmentNotification`, `calculatePriority`, and `calculateEstimatedCompletionTime`.


**`Orders.jsx` (Frontend):** This component, responsible for displaying and managing orders, saw significant changes.

* **Order status update:** A major addition was the implementation of order status updates via a dropdown menu within each order row.  This functionality interacts with the backend `/api/v1/admin/updateWorkQueue` endpoint. Feedback messages (success and error) were also incorporated.

* **Initial render:** The initial render of the order table was modified to include a loading indicator (`Loader`) and error handling.  Previously it was just commented code, now it's fully functional code with loading indicators and status update functionality.

**`admin.routes.js` (Backend):**  This file defines routes for the admin panel. The main changes include:

* **Routing for graphics controller:**  Several new routes were added to handle functions from `graphics.controller.js`, including order creation, getting pending orders, reassigning orders, and getting assigned orders for graphics users. The routes are appropriately protected using middleware (`auth`, `isAdmin`, `isGraphics`).  A `/updateWorkQueue` route was added.

**`EditOrder.jsx` (Frontend):** This component shows changes in the order editing process.

* **Image handling:** This component now handles image uploads/updates, using previews generated from selected files and showing existing images from the order.

* **Initial state:**  The component's initial state was changed to include more comprehensive order details, particularly handling image paths that may not begin with `http`, prepending the `BASE_URL` if necessary.  The `assignedToId` field was added for better backend interaction.

**`GraphicsOrder.jsx` (Frontend):** This component displays orders assigned to graphics users.

* **Enhancements:**  Significant UI improvements,  including filtering, search functionality and styled status indicators using color-coded classes for status visualization based on order status.



**Recurring elements:**  The use of `mongoose`, `async/await`, error handling (try...catch blocks), and population of related database fields are common throughout the backend code. The frontend code consistently uses `fetch` for API calls, state management (`useState`, `useEffect`), and styled components for UI.  Consistent use of React's functional components, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Lucide/Heroicons for icons is noted across the frontend code.
