# Activity Summary for 4/5/2025

## 12:38:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `GraphicsOrder.jsx` file between 12:08 AM and 12:25 AM on April 5th, 2025.  The code implements a component to display and manage graphics orders.  No changes were made to the functionality across the revisions.  All three revisions are identical. The component fetches order data from an API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/assigned`), displays the orders in a table, and allows users to update the status of each order via a dropdown menu. The component handles loading and error states, provides visual feedback for status updates, and refreshes the order list after a status change.  The status options are hardcoded as ["Pending", "InProgress", "Completed", "Failed", "Paused"].  Image display is also included, pulling image URLs from the API response and prepending the `BASE_URL` obtained from the environment variable `VITE_BASE_URL`.
