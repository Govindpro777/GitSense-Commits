# Activity Summary for 4/20/2025

The log shows several frontend and backend code changes related to an order management system.  The most significant changes are between April 19th and 20th, 2025.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\AdminOrder\CreateNewOrder.jsx`**: This file, a React component, allows creating new orders.  The April 19th version used `react-hot-toast` for displaying success and error messages.  The April 20th version replaced `react-hot-toast` with standard alert messages, simplifying the error handling.  Both versions handle customer and user selection using custom hooks (`useCustomers`, `useGraphicsUsers`) and make API calls to create orders. Image uploads are also supported.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\routes\designer.routes.js`**: This file defines a backend route for fetching graphics user data.  It uses authentication middleware (`auth`, `isGraphics`) to protect the route.  The change on April 19th shows a simple GET route implementation.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\New folder\Sidebar.jsx`**: This React component renders a sidebar with navigation links based on the user's account type (`SuperAdmin`, `Admin`, `Graphics`, `Display`, `Accounts`, `Viewer`).  The change on April 19th is a relatively large addition showing a dynamic sidebar that adapts its contents based on user roles stored in local storage.  It uses `react-router-dom` for navigation and `react-hot-toast` for logout messages.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\Navbar.jsx`**: This React component renders the application's navbar.  The initial version on April 19th, which was commented out, shows a more basic navbar with features like a sidebar toggle, notifications, and settings.  The later version introduces pagination for fetching notifications, uses `axios` for API calls, and leverages a custom hook (`useSocketEvents`) to handle socket events for real-time updates. This component fetches notifications and displays them, and also includes a mechanism for loading more notifications if available.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\AdminOrder\AccountAssign.jsx`**: This React component handles assigning orders to accounting users.  The commented-out initial version on April 20th indicates that this feature already existed before the update, but was likely refactored. The updated version uses  `axios` for API calls, handles loading and error states, and includes success and error message displays. The component uses `react-hot-toast` for showing messages, and socket events to update the component when the order status changes.  It also performs input validation and only allows assignment if the order's status is appropriate.

Overall, the changes reflect enhancements to the user interface, error handling, and the addition of real-time features through socket integration.  There's a consistent use of React, axios, and custom hooks across the frontend components.  The backend appears to be relatively simple, providing RESTful APIs for the frontend to consume.
