# Activity Summary for 4/26/2025

## 10:40:51 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to backend and frontend code related to order management.  The `order.controller.js` file underwent significant changes throughout the log.  Initially, it contained functions for assigning, fetching, and retrieving orders.  A commented-out `updateOrder` function was present early on, indicating an in-progress feature. Later revisions added functionality for updating and deleting orders, including comprehensive logging of changes using a `Log` model and detailed logging of changes to assigned users. The updateOrder function was modified to include detailed logging of changes and conditional notifications. The `assignOrder` function was modified to change the order status to `graphics_pending` upon assignment.  A new `approveOrder` function was added to handle order approvals, transitioning the status to "InWorkQueue". A `deleteOrder` function was added to remove orders and associated WorkQueueItems.


The `graphics.controller.js` file introduces order creation functionality, including assigning orders to available "Graphics" users using an aggregation pipeline to find users with the least active orders.  It also includes functions for getting pending orders, reassigning unassigned orders and getting a user's assigned orders.  It uses an `Agenda` scheduler for processing orders, and implements a notification system using socket.io and a `notification` model.   The `findAvailableGraphicsUser` function was used to select a graphics user to assign the order to.


At 10:13:29 AM, the `PrivateRoute.jsx` file (frontend) was updated, implementing a simple authentication check using `localStorage` to redirect users to the login page if no `accountType` is found.  No other frontend changes were included in this log.

There is a recurring pattern of using `populate` in multiple queries to fetch related data (customer, assignedTo, createdBy) for orders. The code also uses transactions to ensure atomicity in order creation and reassignment.  The use of `mongoose`, `express`, `socket.io`, and `cloudinary` (inferred from `ImageUploader`) suggests a Node.js application with a MongoDB database.
