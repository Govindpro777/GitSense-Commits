# Activity Summary for 4/29/2025

## 10:37:06 AM
The code consists of two files: `graphics.controller.js` and `autoCutout.controller.js`, both dealing with order management and assignment within a system likely for graphic design or manufacturing.  Both were modified on April 29th, 2025.

`graphics.controller.js` (9:50:52 AM): This file manages order creation and assignment to "Graphics" users.  Key functions include:

* `createOrder`:  Handles new order creation, including file uploads (`localFileUpload`),  finding an available Graphics user (`findAvailableGraphicsUser`), creating a WorkQueue item, scheduling the order for processing using `agenda`, and sending a notification (`sendAssignmentNotification`) upon assignment using socket.io.  It uses transactions for data consistency.
* `getPendingOrders`: Retrieves orders with statuses 'New' or 'InWorkQueue'.
* `reassignUnassignedOrders`: Reassigns orders without an assigned user to available Graphics users.
* `getUserAssignedOrders`: Retrieves orders assigned to a specific user.

Helper functions calculate order priority and estimated completion time.  The code extensively uses Mongoose for database interaction and Agenda for job scheduling.  Error handling and transaction management are implemented throughout.


`autoCutout.controller.js` (10:25:20 AM): This file focuses on automatically assigning orders to "Cutout" users.  Key functions include:

* `assignOrderToCutout`: Assigns an order to a Cutout user, either specified or automatically chosen using `findAvailableCutoutUser`.  This function also updates the WorkQueue, logs the assignment change using a `Log` model, and sends a notification. Transactions are used to ensure data consistency.
* `updateCutoutWorkQueueStatus`: Updates the status of a Cutout work queue item.  It validates the input status, updates timestamps (`startedAt`, `completedAt`), and handles potential errors.

Similar to `graphics.controller.js`, this file uses Mongoose, socket.io, and incorporates helper functions for priority and estimated completion time calculations.  The `sendAssignmentNotification` function is largely similar to the one in `graphics.controller.js`, differing only in the notification message.  Both files share a common pattern of using aggregate queries to find available users based on their account type and current workload.  Both heavily utilize `mongoose` and `socket.io` for database management and real-time notifications.  Both also use a `Log` model for auditing purposes.


## 11:27:09 AM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `HomeworkBanner.js` and `ClaimOffer.js`.

`HomeworkBanner.js` underwent two updates on April 29th, 2025.  The first update at 10:34:57 AM shows the initial version of the component, which includes a form to describe a project, an option for "Human experts only," and modals for signup and welcome messages.  The submission logic redirects to the signup modal if a user isn't logged in and to the welcome modal if they are.  The second update at 10:35:51 AM adds client-side validation to the form, requiring the user to input a project description before submitting.

`ClaimOffer.js` was updated three times on April 29th, 2025. The initial version (10:44:08 AM) displays an offer and a form to collect a user's phone number.  The second version (10:44:57 AM) introduces input validation and an asynchronous `handleSubmit` function, which simulates sending the offer and handles potential errors.  A loading state (`isSubmitting`) is implemented to disable the button during the submission process. The final update (10:46:31 AM) adds error handling, displaying error messages below the input field if validation fails or the API call encounters an error.  This version enhances user experience by providing more feedback and preventing multiple submissions while awaiting a response.  The changes to `ClaimOffer.js` consistently focus on enhancing the form's functionality and user experience through error handling and validation.


## 12:45:28 PM
The `Signup.js` component was updated on 4/29/2025, 12:40:57 PM.  The key change is the addition of a welcome modal.  The original code was a signup form with email input, user agreement, and marketing preference checkboxes.  The updated code retains the original signup form but now, upon successful submission (instead of closing the modal), it displays a `WelcomeModal` component.  The `WelcomeModal` is closed using `handleWelcomeModalClose`, which then closes the signup modal.  No other significant structural changes to the signup form itself were made; the styling and functionality remain largely consistent.  The import of `lucide-react` and `use client` are also noteworthy additions.


## 2:12:48 PM
The log shows numerous code changes across several React components related to a homework/project management platform.  A significant pattern is the consistent use of a navigation header across multiple pages (`page.jsx` files) featuring conditional rendering based on authentication status.  This header uses `CommunityNavbar` for authenticated users and `LandingNavbar` for unauthenticated users.  Additionally,  `MobileNavBar` is consistently included for authenticated users.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\projects\page.jsx` and `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\projects\page.jsx`  both underwent updates at 2:06 PM, changing the component rendered to `MyProject` from `expert`. This suggests a renaming or refactoring of a component. The initial version of this file (1:27 PM) shows a simple header and `CreateProject` component.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\HomeworkBanner.js`  was updated at 1:30 PM.  The primary change was to replace the display of a welcome modal after login with a redirect to the `/homework/projects` page using `next/navigation`'s `useRouter` hook.  The commented-out code suggests earlier versions included more elaborate modal handling.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\CreateProject.js` shows multiple revisions between 1:31 PM and 2:05 PM. The component was significantly enhanced with features including: responsive tabs, a sidebar toggle, responsive layout adjustments, image placeholders,  and a "Create a Project" button that was refactored to be a `next/link` component.  The final version at 2:05 PM was renamed to `MyProject`.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\projects\create-project\page.jsx` and `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\create\page.jsx` were both updated at 1:34 PM and 1:56 PM respectively, using the newly created `CreateNewProject` component.  These files share the same header structure as the `page.jsx` files mentioned above.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\CreateNewProject.js`  is initially commented out (2:02 PM and 2:03 PM) and then remained unchanged. It shows a form for creating new projects with fields for title, content, type, subject, deadline, and order type selection.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\auction\page.jsx` was updated at 2:01 PM and 2:09 PM,  using the `Auction` component.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\Auction.js` was updated at 2:08 PM and 2:11 PM. This component includes a progress tracker, project promotion section, tutor cards (`TutorCard` component), and sections for payment, progress updates, chat, downloads, refunds, bonuses, warranties, and feedback, suggesting a comprehensive project workflow.  The most notable change between the two versions is the addition of `ProjectDetails` component to the right sidebar in the 2:11 PM version.


## 3:12:46 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React component files within a project, primarily focusing on project status updates.  The files `Auction.js`, `InProgress.js`, and `Completed.js` all share a common structure: they display a progress tracker with five steps ("Submit a project", "At the auction", "In progress", "Under warranty", "Completed") and then further content specific to each stage.

The `InProgress.js` file underwent the most revisions between 2:16 PM and 2:35 PM.  Initial versions included many components (`Chat`, `DownloadFiles`, `RefundRequestForm`, `RefundReason`, `BonusReward`, `ProjectWarranty`, `LikeExpert`, `FeedbackCard`), which were progressively removed in later commits, simplifying the component's rendering. The `steps` array within `InProgress.js` also received several updates, changing the `isActive` and `isCompleted` status of different project steps to reflect the progression through the project stages.

The `Completed.js` file also received numerous revisions between 2:38 PM and 2:51 PM. Initially, this file contained the same structure and components as `Auction.js` and `InProgress.js`, but subsequent commits gradually removed all components except `ProjectDetails`, `BonusReward`, and `FeedbackCard`.  Additionally, an "Annotated Bibliography" section was added and stylistically refined over several edits with increased font size and padding. The final version of `Completed.js` presents a concise layout focusing on the concluding elements of a project.

The `Auction.js` file had minimal changes after its initial commit at 2:13 PM, mainly involving a minor stylistic adjustment in the styling of the `subLabel` within the steps component, changing the color and potentially the underlining.

In `app\homework\in-progress\page.jsx` and `app\homework\warranty\page.jsx` and `app\homework\completed\page.jsx` files the only update involves linking to corresponding component files. The `page.jsx` files primarily act as containers for rendering respective components, and their changes reflect this.  The initial and final states show consistency with the import of the relevant component. There was an error in `completed.jsx` file where the name was not correct initially `Auction` was used instead of `Completed`


A recurring theme across all component files is the use of a `steps` array to represent the project's lifecycle, indicating a well-structured approach to managing the project status visualization.  The consistent use of  `Image` from `next/image` and similar styling throughout suggests a unified design system.


## 4:12:51 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React components within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, focusing on the project landing page.  The changes primarily involve styling adjustments using Tailwind CSS and the addition of interactive elements.

The `Warranty.js` component was updated twice within a short timeframe (4/29/2025, 3:15 PM to 3:19 PM), with minor changes to heading sizes in the "Annotated Bibliography" section.  No functional changes were made to the core component logic.

The `Completed.js` component was created/updated on 4/29/2025 at 3:19 PM,  displaying a project completion status with a progress tracker. This component includes similar styling to others in the log and utilizes the same progress tracker component.

`InProgress.js`,  also updated at 3:20 PM on 4/29/2025, adds a "Cancel" sub-label to a step in the project progress tracker, suggesting a cancelation feature.  The styling is consistent with other components.

The `Auction.js` component underwent the most significant changes throughout the log (from 3:21 PM to 3:59 PM). These edits involved extensive styling alterations, improving responsiveness, adding a "Sort By" functionality with a modal, and incorporating tutor cards (`TutorCard` component).  The "Sort By" modal uses  `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks for managing modal visibility and outside clicks. The `sortBy` state is updated, showing a preference towards responsive UI changes and dynamic text updates.

The `UploadFiles.js` component was updated at 3:28 PM and 4:01 PM on 4/29/2025, adding functionality to upload files, display uploaded files and include filtering and sorting options.  The UI includes tabs for "All", "Your Files", and "Writer's Files". A modal is implemented to handle filtering and has similar outside click handling mechanism as the `Auction.js` component.  Noteworthy is the use of `useEffect` for managing outside clicks on the filter modal.

The `LikeExpert.js` component was created/updated on 4/29/2025 at 4:03 PM, providing options to view all experts or change the currently selected expert.

Finally, the `ExpertCard.js` component was updated twice between 4:03 PM and 4:04 PM on 4/29/2025.  These updates made improvements to responsiveness of the tutor card, especially on mobile view. The component uses `useRef` and `useEffect` for modal handling and outside clicks.

A common pattern across all components is the use of a progress tracker, consistent styling elements (predominantly Tailwind CSS classes), and the consistent use of  `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks for managing modals and outside clicks.  There is also an emphasis on responsive design using media queries (`@media`) to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.


## 5:12:40 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `MyProject.js` and a single entry for `ActiveProject.js`.  The `MyProject.js` file underwent several minor modifications between 4:21 PM and 4:25 PM, primarily involving adjustments to the `transform` property within the `indicatorStyle` object in the `useEffect` hook.  The value fluctuated slightly  (-48%, -52%, -50%), suggesting fine-tuning of the visual positioning of a tab indicator. At 4:24:31 PM, a minor styling change removed  `overflow-x-auto` from a `div` and at 4:24:55 PM, it was re-added. This suggests some experimentation with horizontal scrolling behavior.


The `ActiveProject.js` file (timestamp 4:25:23 PM) introduces a new component displaying a list of active projects. It includes features like project filtering by type (`All`, `At the Auction`, etc.), a search bar, and a subject dropdown.  This component uses a `projectsData` array, which likely gets its data from a backend. The visual styling is extensive, indicating a focus on responsive design across different screen sizes.  The structure is similar to `MyProject.js`, with a sidebar toggle and tabbed navigation.


## 5:28:14 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the backend controllers of a system, likely for order management.  Significant changes occurred between 4:48 PM and 5:12 PM on April 29th, 2025.

`autoCutout.controller.js` (4:48 PM): This file focuses on automatically assigning orders to "Cutout" users.  The `assignOrderToCutOut` function finds the least busy active Cutout user and assigns them the order, updating the order status to "cutout_pending".  A crucial addition is logging all changes made to an order, including user assignments, into a `Log` model.  A notification (`sendAssignmentNotification`) is sent after assignment, although its implementation is rudimentary.

`graphics.controller.js` (4:50 PM and 5:12 PM): This file manages order assignment to "Graphics" users.  The `createOrder` function handles new order creation, including local file uploads using `localFileUpload`, finding an available Graphics user (or accepting a pre-assigned one), creating a `WorkQueue` item, and scheduling order processing using `agenda`. The `findAvailableGraphicsUser` function uses aggregation to find the least busy Graphics user.  The `sendAssignmentNotification` function is significantly improved, using socket.io (`socketManager`) to send real-time notifications to assigned users via a `notification` model.  Additional functions handle fetching pending orders, reassigning unassigned orders, and retrieving a user's assigned orders.  There is a consistent pattern of using `mongoose` transactions to ensure data consistency.  Between the two timestamps, no changes happened to the controller, but the helper function `sendAssignmentNotification` was updated to use socket.io for real-time notifications, a significant improvement for user experience.

`order.controller.js` (4:51 PM and 4:53 PM): This file contains functions for managing orders, including assignment, retrieval, and updates.  The `assignOrder` function assigns an order to a user, updating the order status.  `getOrders` and `getOrderById` fetch orders based on various criteria.  The most significant change between the two timestamps is in the `updateOrder` function. Initially a commented-out function, the final version implements detailed logging of all changes (requirements, dimensions, assignedTo, status, images) using the `Log` model.  The changes are logged individually, providing a detailed audit trail.  The auto-assignment to cutout user is triggered if the order status is changed to "admin_approved".

Recurring elements across all files include:

* Extensive use of `mongoose` for database interactions, including transactions for data integrity.
* Use of helper functions for common tasks (e.g., finding available users, sending notifications).
* Consistent error handling and JSON responses.
* Use of `populate` to efficiently retrieve related data.


The overall pattern reveals a well-structured system focused on order management with increasing emphasis on user experience (real-time notifications) and detailed logging for auditing and debugging.


## 6:12:44 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `CreateNewProject.js`  between 5:33 PM and 5:56 PM on April 29, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged throughout these edits; all revisions contain the same React component for creating a new project. The component includes form fields for project title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type (self or auto), and an option to request a specific writer.  The UI uses a consistent styling with Tailwind CSS classes. No functional changes are apparent in the provided code snippets; the `handleSubmit` function only logs the form data to the console.  The frequent timestamps suggest the developer might have been saving the file repeatedly during the development process.


## 6:28:11 PM
The `OrderDetailsModal.jsx` component underwent several changes between 6:24:43 PM and 6:25:53 PM on April 29, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: displaying order details, fetching file data, and assigning orders to cutout users.

The most significant change was the addition of admin approval/rejection functionality.  Between 6:24:55 PM and 6:25:53 PM, buttons to approve ("admin_approved") and reject ("admin_rejected") orders were added to the "Requirements" section.  This involved importing `ThumbsUp` and `ThumbsDown` icons from `lucide-react`, and adding a `handleStatusUpdate` function (not shown in the provided logs but implied by the code).  The buttons incorporate loading indicators (`Loader` icon) while the update is in progress.


A minor change involved the styling and layout of the "Requirements" section.  Initially, it was a simple text display; afterward, it became a more structured section with the approval/rejection buttons added beside the title.  The visual changes between the logs likely reflect this minor adjustment.

Throughout the code,  consistent use of `axios` and `fetch` for API calls is observed, utilizing `localStorage.getItem("token")` for authentication.  Error handling using `try...catch` blocks and loading states (`setLoading`) are consistently implemented across asynchronous operations. The code also uses a consistent styling approach with Tailwind CSS classes for UI elements.


## 7:12:38 PM
The log shows a single code change on April 29, 2025, at 6:17:34 PM to `CreateNewProject.js`. This file is a React component for creating new projects.  The component includes form fields for project title, content, type, subject, deadline, order type ('self' or 'auto'), and an option to request a specific writer.  The form handles submission, logging the collected data to the console.  The UI is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes with varied text sizes and component layouts. The component uses Mantine UI for date pickers and other elements.  Significant styling is applied using inline styles and classes, heavily employing responsive design principles.  The component features image placeholders for icons, dropdowns, and buttons, indicating visual elements beyond the core form functionality.  A key feature is the selection between "self-choosing" a writer or "auto-matching," which significantly alters the displayed options within the form.
