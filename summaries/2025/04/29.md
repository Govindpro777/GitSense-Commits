# Activity Summary for 4/29/2025

## 10:37:06 AM
The code consists of two files: `graphics.controller.js` and `autoCutout.controller.js`, both dealing with order management and assignment within a system likely for graphic design or manufacturing.  Both were modified on April 29th, 2025.

`graphics.controller.js` (9:50:52 AM): This file manages order creation and assignment to "Graphics" users.  Key functions include:

* `createOrder`:  Handles new order creation, including file uploads (`localFileUpload`),  finding an available Graphics user (`findAvailableGraphicsUser`), creating a WorkQueue item, scheduling the order for processing using `agenda`, and sending a notification (`sendAssignmentNotification`) upon assignment using socket.io.  It uses transactions for data consistency.
* `getPendingOrders`: Retrieves orders with statuses 'New' or 'InWorkQueue'.
* `reassignUnassignedOrders`: Reassigns orders without an assigned user to available Graphics users.
* `getUserAssignedOrders`: Retrieves orders assigned to a specific user.

Helper functions calculate order priority and estimated completion time.  The code extensively uses Mongoose for database interaction and Agenda for job scheduling.  Error handling and transaction management are implemented throughout.


`autoCutout.controller.js` (10:25:20 AM): This file focuses on automatically assigning orders to "Cutout" users.  Key functions include:

* `assignOrderToCutout`: Assigns an order to a Cutout user, either specified or automatically chosen using `findAvailableCutoutUser`.  This function also updates the WorkQueue, logs the assignment change using a `Log` model, and sends a notification. Transactions are used to ensure data consistency.
* `updateCutoutWorkQueueStatus`: Updates the status of a Cutout work queue item.  It validates the input status, updates timestamps (`startedAt`, `completedAt`), and handles potential errors.

Similar to `graphics.controller.js`, this file uses Mongoose, socket.io, and incorporates helper functions for priority and estimated completion time calculations.  The `sendAssignmentNotification` function is largely similar to the one in `graphics.controller.js`, differing only in the notification message.  Both files share a common pattern of using aggregate queries to find available users based on their account type and current workload.  Both heavily utilize `mongoose` and `socket.io` for database management and real-time notifications.  Both also use a `Log` model for auditing purposes.
