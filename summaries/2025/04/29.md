# Activity Summary for 4/29/2025

## 10:37:06 AM
The code consists of two files: `graphics.controller.js` and `autoCutout.controller.js`, both dealing with order management and assignment within a system likely for graphic design or manufacturing.  Both were modified on April 29th, 2025.

`graphics.controller.js` (9:50:52 AM): This file manages order creation and assignment to "Graphics" users.  Key functions include:

* `createOrder`:  Handles new order creation, including file uploads (`localFileUpload`),  finding an available Graphics user (`findAvailableGraphicsUser`), creating a WorkQueue item, scheduling the order for processing using `agenda`, and sending a notification (`sendAssignmentNotification`) upon assignment using socket.io.  It uses transactions for data consistency.
* `getPendingOrders`: Retrieves orders with statuses 'New' or 'InWorkQueue'.
* `reassignUnassignedOrders`: Reassigns orders without an assigned user to available Graphics users.
* `getUserAssignedOrders`: Retrieves orders assigned to a specific user.

Helper functions calculate order priority and estimated completion time.  The code extensively uses Mongoose for database interaction and Agenda for job scheduling.  Error handling and transaction management are implemented throughout.


`autoCutout.controller.js` (10:25:20 AM): This file focuses on automatically assigning orders to "Cutout" users.  Key functions include:

* `assignOrderToCutout`: Assigns an order to a Cutout user, either specified or automatically chosen using `findAvailableCutoutUser`.  This function also updates the WorkQueue, logs the assignment change using a `Log` model, and sends a notification. Transactions are used to ensure data consistency.
* `updateCutoutWorkQueueStatus`: Updates the status of a Cutout work queue item.  It validates the input status, updates timestamps (`startedAt`, `completedAt`), and handles potential errors.

Similar to `graphics.controller.js`, this file uses Mongoose, socket.io, and incorporates helper functions for priority and estimated completion time calculations.  The `sendAssignmentNotification` function is largely similar to the one in `graphics.controller.js`, differing only in the notification message.  Both files share a common pattern of using aggregate queries to find available users based on their account type and current workload.  Both heavily utilize `mongoose` and `socket.io` for database management and real-time notifications.  Both also use a `Log` model for auditing purposes.


## 11:27:09 AM
The log shows modifications to two React components: `HomeworkBanner.js` and `ClaimOffer.js`.

`HomeworkBanner.js` underwent two updates on April 29th, 2025.  The first update at 10:34:57 AM shows the initial version of the component, which includes a form to describe a project, an option for "Human experts only," and modals for signup and welcome messages.  The submission logic redirects to the signup modal if a user isn't logged in and to the welcome modal if they are.  The second update at 10:35:51 AM adds client-side validation to the form, requiring the user to input a project description before submitting.

`ClaimOffer.js` was updated three times on April 29th, 2025. The initial version (10:44:08 AM) displays an offer and a form to collect a user's phone number.  The second version (10:44:57 AM) introduces input validation and an asynchronous `handleSubmit` function, which simulates sending the offer and handles potential errors.  A loading state (`isSubmitting`) is implemented to disable the button during the submission process. The final update (10:46:31 AM) adds error handling, displaying error messages below the input field if validation fails or the API call encounters an error.  This version enhances user experience by providing more feedback and preventing multiple submissions while awaiting a response.  The changes to `ClaimOffer.js` consistently focus on enhancing the form's functionality and user experience through error handling and validation.


## 12:45:28 PM
The `Signup.js` component was updated on 4/29/2025, 12:40:57 PM.  The key change is the addition of a welcome modal.  The original code was a signup form with email input, user agreement, and marketing preference checkboxes.  The updated code retains the original signup form but now, upon successful submission (instead of closing the modal), it displays a `WelcomeModal` component.  The `WelcomeModal` is closed using `handleWelcomeModalClose`, which then closes the signup modal.  No other significant structural changes to the signup form itself were made; the styling and functionality remain largely consistent.  The import of `lucide-react` and `use client` are also noteworthy additions.


## 2:12:48 PM
The log shows numerous code changes across several React components related to a homework/project management platform.  A significant pattern is the consistent use of a navigation header across multiple pages (`page.jsx` files) featuring conditional rendering based on authentication status.  This header uses `CommunityNavbar` for authenticated users and `LandingNavbar` for unauthenticated users.  Additionally,  `MobileNavBar` is consistently included for authenticated users.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\projects\page.jsx` and `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\projects\page.jsx`  both underwent updates at 2:06 PM, changing the component rendered to `MyProject` from `expert`. This suggests a renaming or refactoring of a component. The initial version of this file (1:27 PM) shows a simple header and `CreateProject` component.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\HomeworkBanner.js`  was updated at 1:30 PM.  The primary change was to replace the display of a welcome modal after login with a redirect to the `/homework/projects` page using `next/navigation`'s `useRouter` hook.  The commented-out code suggests earlier versions included more elaborate modal handling.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\CreateProject.js` shows multiple revisions between 1:31 PM and 2:05 PM. The component was significantly enhanced with features including: responsive tabs, a sidebar toggle, responsive layout adjustments, image placeholders,  and a "Create a Project" button that was refactored to be a `next/link` component.  The final version at 2:05 PM was renamed to `MyProject`.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\projects\create-project\page.jsx` and `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\create\page.jsx` were both updated at 1:34 PM and 1:56 PM respectively, using the newly created `CreateNewProject` component.  These files share the same header structure as the `page.jsx` files mentioned above.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\CreateNewProject.js`  is initially commented out (2:02 PM and 2:03 PM) and then remained unchanged. It shows a form for creating new projects with fields for title, content, type, subject, deadline, and order type selection.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\app\homework\auction\page.jsx` was updated at 2:01 PM and 2:09 PM,  using the `Auction` component.


`c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Expert Buddy Intern\xpertbuddy-frontend\src\components\landingPage\Project\Auction.js` was updated at 2:08 PM and 2:11 PM. This component includes a progress tracker, project promotion section, tutor cards (`TutorCard` component), and sections for payment, progress updates, chat, downloads, refunds, bonuses, warranties, and feedback, suggesting a comprehensive project workflow.  The most notable change between the two versions is the addition of `ProjectDetails` component to the right sidebar in the 2:11 PM version.


## 3:12:46 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several React component files within a project, primarily focusing on project status updates.  The files `Auction.js`, `InProgress.js`, and `Completed.js` all share a common structure: they display a progress tracker with five steps ("Submit a project", "At the auction", "In progress", "Under warranty", "Completed") and then further content specific to each stage.

The `InProgress.js` file underwent the most revisions between 2:16 PM and 2:35 PM.  Initial versions included many components (`Chat`, `DownloadFiles`, `RefundRequestForm`, `RefundReason`, `BonusReward`, `ProjectWarranty`, `LikeExpert`, `FeedbackCard`), which were progressively removed in later commits, simplifying the component's rendering. The `steps` array within `InProgress.js` also received several updates, changing the `isActive` and `isCompleted` status of different project steps to reflect the progression through the project stages.

The `Completed.js` file also received numerous revisions between 2:38 PM and 2:51 PM. Initially, this file contained the same structure and components as `Auction.js` and `InProgress.js`, but subsequent commits gradually removed all components except `ProjectDetails`, `BonusReward`, and `FeedbackCard`.  Additionally, an "Annotated Bibliography" section was added and stylistically refined over several edits with increased font size and padding. The final version of `Completed.js` presents a concise layout focusing on the concluding elements of a project.

The `Auction.js` file had minimal changes after its initial commit at 2:13 PM, mainly involving a minor stylistic adjustment in the styling of the `subLabel` within the steps component, changing the color and potentially the underlining.

In `app\homework\in-progress\page.jsx` and `app\homework\warranty\page.jsx` and `app\homework\completed\page.jsx` files the only update involves linking to corresponding component files. The `page.jsx` files primarily act as containers for rendering respective components, and their changes reflect this.  The initial and final states show consistency with the import of the relevant component. There was an error in `completed.jsx` file where the name was not correct initially `Auction` was used instead of `Completed`


A recurring theme across all component files is the use of a `steps` array to represent the project's lifecycle, indicating a well-structured approach to managing the project status visualization.  The consistent use of  `Image` from `next/image` and similar styling throughout suggests a unified design system.
