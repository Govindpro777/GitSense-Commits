# Activity Summary for 4/29/2025

## 10:37:06 AM
The code consists of two files: `graphics.controller.js` and `autoCutout.controller.js`, both dealing with order management and assignment within a system likely for graphic design or manufacturing.  Both were modified on April 29th, 2025.

`graphics.controller.js` (9:50:52 AM): This file manages order creation and assignment to "Graphics" users.  Key functions include:

* `createOrder`:  Handles new order creation, including file uploads (`localFileUpload`),  finding an available Graphics user (`findAvailableGraphicsUser`), creating a WorkQueue item, scheduling the order for processing using `agenda`, and sending a notification (`sendAssignmentNotification`) upon assignment using socket.io.  It uses transactions for data consistency.
* `getPendingOrders`: Retrieves orders with statuses 'New' or 'InWorkQueue'.
* `reassignUnassignedOrders`: Reassigns orders without an assigned user to available Graphics users.
* `getUserAssignedOrders`: Retrieves orders assigned to a specific user.

Helper functions calculate order priority and estimated completion time.  The code extensively uses Mongoose for database interaction and Agenda for job scheduling.  Error handling and transaction management are implemented throughout.


`autoCutout.controller.js` (10:25:20 AM): This file focuses on automatically assigning orders to "Cutout" users.  Key functions include:

* `assignOrderToCutout`: Assigns an order to a Cutout user, either specified or automatically chosen using `findAvailableCutoutUser`.  This function also updates the WorkQueue, logs the assignment change using a `Log` model, and sends a notification. Transactions are used to ensure data consistency.
* `updateCutoutWorkQueueStatus`: Updates the status of a Cutout work queue item.  It validates the input status, updates timestamps (`startedAt`, `completedAt`), and handles potential errors.

Similar to `graphics.controller.js`, this file uses Mongoose, socket.io, and incorporates helper functions for priority and estimated completion time calculations.  The `sendAssignmentNotification` function is largely similar to the one in `graphics.controller.js`, differing only in the notification message.  Both files share a common pattern of using aggregate queries to find available users based on their account type and current workload.  Both heavily utilize `mongoose` and `socket.io` for database management and real-time notifications.  Both also use a `Log` model for auditing purposes.

The log shows modifications to two React components: `HomeworkBanner.js` and `ClaimOffer.js`.

`HomeworkBanner.js` underwent two updates on April 29th, 2025.  The first update at 10:34:57 AM shows the initial version of the component, which includes a form to describe a project, an option for "Human experts only," and modals for signup and welcome messages.  The submission logic redirects to the signup modal if a user isn't logged in and to the welcome modal if they are.  The second update at 10:35:51 AM adds client-side validation to the form, requiring the user to input a project description before submitting.

`ClaimOffer.js` was updated three times on April 29th, 2025. The initial version (10:44:08 AM) displays an offer and a form to collect a user's phone number.  The second version (10:44:57 AM) introduces input validation and an asynchronous `handleSubmit` function, which simulates sending the offer and handles potential errors.  A loading state (`isSubmitting`) is implemented to disable the button during the submission process. The final update (10:46:31 AM) adds error handling, displaying error messages below the input field if validation fails or the API call encounters an error.  This version enhances user experience by providing more feedback and preventing multiple submissions while awaiting a response.  The changes to `ClaimOffer.js` consistently focus on enhancing the form's functionality and user experience through error handling and validation.
