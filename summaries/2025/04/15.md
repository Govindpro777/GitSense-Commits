# Activity Summary for 4/15/2025

## 5:04:39 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `ChooseExpert.js`, a React component for a landing page likely related to an expert-finding platform.  The most significant changes involve responsive design adjustments and a complete removal and then reintroduction of the component's code.

The initial commits (1:32 AM) show a component with sections for `ProjectDetails`, including form elements for subject area, project type, deadline, word count, and an "Express Project" option.  There's also a chat section displaying a list of experts with their details. A progress tracker visually represents the project's workflow stages.

Between 1:32 AM and 1:49 AM, the entire `ChooseExpert.js` component was commented out, suggesting a major rework or temporary removal during development.  This is a significant change indicating potential restructuring.

The final commit (2:03 AM) shows the component restored but significantly altered. The most notable change is the addition of responsive design features using Tailwind CSS classes  (e.g., `2xs:mt-0`, `md:text-[16px]`).  Various text sizes, padding, margins, and component sizes are adjusted based on screen size.  The progress tracker is also redesigned to be more responsive.  The changes suggest the component now adapts better to various screen sizes for better user experience. There are no other significant changes outside of styling and responsive design elements.


## 11:46:49 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025.  The code remains largely unchanged throughout these edits, suggesting minor adjustments or reformatting rather than substantial functional changes.  The timestamps indicate frequent, short edits between 9:39 AM and 11:37 AM. The code consists primarily of React JSX, rendering a UI component involving images (using `next/image`), styled components using tailwindcss-like syntax, and components from the `lucide-react` library (icons).  The component displays project details, a progress tracker, and a chat list.  No significant structural changes are observed across the revisions.

## 2:00:25 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025, between 1:11 PM and 1:55 PM.  The code consists primarily of React JSX, creating a user interface with elements like input fields, buttons, and a chat list.  The changes appear to be iterative refinements and additions to the existing UI, rather than substantial structural alterations.  There is consistent use of inline styling with tailwind CSS classes for layout and design.  The repeated use of `<Image>` components suggests the UI is image-heavy.  No significant patterns in content changes are evident beyond iterative refinement over the timeframe.  The majority of edits seem focused on minor styling adjustments and possibly bug fixes, given the short time interval between changes.


## 3:00:27 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025, between 2:02 PM and 2:57 PM.  The changes appear to be iterative refinements to the component's UI, with no significant structural alterations.  The code consistently uses a functional component structure and relies heavily on inline styling with Tailwind CSS.  The repeated nature of the code suggests incremental adjustments to styling and layout.  There is a chat section which displays a list of chats with user information.  The timestamps suggest a period of focused development and testing of the UI.


## 4:01:18 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025, between 3:06 PM and 3:57 PM.  The code consistently remains largely unchanged, suggesting minor modifications or formatting adjustments rather than substantial functional alterations.  The majority of the changes seem to involve comments (`//`), indicating potential debugging or documentation updates. The file contains ReactJS code, utilizing components for styling and user interface elements such as  input fields, buttons, and icons from the `lucide-react` library.  There's a section that appears to render a chat list, fetching data that includes names, verification statuses, ratings, messages, and prices from an array of objects. A progress tracker is also present, illustrating the stages of a project.  While there are multiple timestamps, the actual code content remains visually identical across all entries.  This suggests a potential issue with the logging process, where only the timestamp is updated without reflecting actual code changes.


## 5:00:28 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ChooseExpert.js` between 4:02 PM and 4:59 PM on April 15, 2025.  The changes primarily involve styling adjustments and minor content updates.  There's no discernible pattern in the changes besides iterative refinements to the UI.  The code consistently uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide React for icons.  

The most significant changes appear around 4:33 PM, where a substantial rewrite occurred. This revision introduces responsive design using Tailwind's responsive modifiers (`md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xs:`, `xs:`), adds a state variable `expanded` for a collapsible section, replaces some `<span>` elements with `<Image>` components, and updates the visual elements.  Further minor modifications to styling and component structure are present after 4:33 PM. The changes  between 4:02 PM and 4:32 PM are less substantial, appearing to be  mostly minor formatting and code cleanup.


## 7:00:31 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025, between 6:11 PM and 6:43 PM.  The changes primarily focus on styling and minor UI adjustments within the `ProjectDetails` component and the main `ChooseExpert` component.

**`ProjectDetails` Component Changes:**

* **6:11 PM - 6:17 PM:**  Several modifications were made to the styling of various elements, adjusting font sizes (`text-[14px]`, `text-[18px]`, etc.), colors (e.g.,  `text-purple-600`, `bg-[#FAE8FF]`), spacing (`space-x-2`, `mb-4`), and other CSS properties across headings, labels, input fields, buttons, and images. The overall goal seems to improve responsiveness and visual appeal.  The `h3` tag's font size was particularly adjusted multiple times.

* **6:16 PM - 6:18 PM:**  `ChevronDown` components were replaced with `<Image>` components using the source `/landing-page/uil_arrow.svg`.  This suggests a shift from using the `lucide-react` library's arrow icon to a custom SVG.

* **6:23 PM - 6:32 PM:** Further refinements to the styling continued, with additional tweaks to font sizes and colors, and minor repositioning of image elements using `ml-2` and `ml-1` classes.

* **6:29 PM - 6:32 PM:**  The color of the ID background in the expanded details section was changed from `bg-purple-100` to `bg-[#A414D5]`.  The color of the "Added:" label was changed to `text-[#6B7B93]`.  The `text-[13px]` class was added for ID and "Added:" spans, emphasizing those elements slightly more.


**`ChooseExpert` Component Changes:**

The changes to the `ChooseExpert` component seem to involve solely the styling of the progress tracker.  These edits were intertwined with the `ProjectDetails` changes, occurring within the same timeframe. The primary stylistic changes involve the color scheme, again using consistent color hex codes like `#640D51` and `bg-[#f5f3ef]`. The component itself remains functionally unchanged.


The overall pattern is iterative refinement of the UI's visual aspects.  There's a consistent use of inline styles and tailwind CSS classes to achieve precise design elements, focusing on responsive design. The change from `ChevronDown` to custom SVGs suggests a design choice aiming for greater control over the look of the arrow icons.


## 9:55:37 PM
The provided code represents a React component for a marketplace, likely for tutors or experts.  Two nearly identical versions exist, with the second update occurring only 2 minutes after the first (7:03 PM and 7:05 PM on April 15th, 2025).  The changes between versions are minimal and not detectable from the provided snippets.

The `MarketPlace.tsx` component includes:

* **`TutorCard` component:** This displays individual tutor profiles, showing name, experience, reviews, price, and buttons to hire or chat. It uses images from the `/public` directory, cycling through three images based on the `imageIndex` prop.  The styling is extensive, using Tailwind CSS classes.

* **`ProjectDetails` component:** This section handles project details, allowing users to input subject area, project type, deadline (a sample deadline of "01.28.2025 10 pm" is shown), word count, and includes sections for file attachment and inviting more tutors.  It also features a promotional section to encourage app usage.

* **Chat Section:** A section for browsing and searching chats, including a filter functionality.


The code uses the `lucide-react` library for icons, and `next/image` for image handling.  The structure suggests a marketplace where users can browse tutors, view project details, and initiate communication.  The minor time difference between the two commits suggests a quick edit or correction was made in the second commit.  No substantive changes are apparent between the two provided versions of the file.
