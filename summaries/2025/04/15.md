# Activity Summary for 4/15/2025

## 5:04:39 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `ChooseExpert.js`, a React component for a landing page likely related to an expert-finding platform.  The most significant changes involve responsive design adjustments and a complete removal and then reintroduction of the component's code.

The initial commits (1:32 AM) show a component with sections for `ProjectDetails`, including form elements for subject area, project type, deadline, word count, and an "Express Project" option.  There's also a chat section displaying a list of experts with their details. A progress tracker visually represents the project's workflow stages.

Between 1:32 AM and 1:49 AM, the entire `ChooseExpert.js` component was commented out, suggesting a major rework or temporary removal during development.  This is a significant change indicating potential restructuring.

The final commit (2:03 AM) shows the component restored but significantly altered. The most notable change is the addition of responsive design features using Tailwind CSS classes  (e.g., `2xs:mt-0`, `md:text-[16px]`).  Various text sizes, padding, margins, and component sizes are adjusted based on screen size.  The progress tracker is also redesigned to be more responsive.  The changes suggest the component now adapts better to various screen sizes for better user experience. There are no other significant changes outside of styling and responsive design elements.


## 11:46:49 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025.  The code remains largely unchanged throughout these edits, suggesting minor adjustments or reformatting rather than substantial functional changes.  The timestamps indicate frequent, short edits between 9:39 AM and 11:37 AM. The code consists primarily of React JSX, rendering a UI component involving images (using `next/image`), styled components using tailwindcss-like syntax, and components from the `lucide-react` library (icons).  The component displays project details, a progress tracker, and a chat list.  No significant structural changes are observed across the revisions.


## 1:00:26 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025, between 11:49 AM and 12:29 PM.  The code consists primarily of JSX for a landing page component.  The changes appear to be incremental refinements of the UI, with no major structural alterations.  Many edits involve minor adjustments to styling (e.g., changing color codes, adding or removing margins/padding), and no significant content changes are observed between the various commits.  The component includes sections for project details, a progress tracker, and a chat list, all implemented using React and the `lucide-react` icon library.  The frequent commits suggest iterative development and design adjustments rather than the implementation of new features.


## 2:00:25 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025, between 1:11 PM and 1:55 PM.  The code consists primarily of React JSX, creating a user interface with elements like input fields, buttons, and a chat list.  The changes appear to be iterative refinements and additions to the existing UI, rather than substantial structural alterations.  There is consistent use of inline styling with tailwind CSS classes for layout and design.  The repeated use of `<Image>` components suggests the UI is image-heavy.  No significant patterns in content changes are evident beyond iterative refinement over the timeframe.  The majority of edits seem focused on minor styling adjustments and possibly bug fixes, given the short time interval between changes.


## 3:00:27 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025, between 2:02 PM and 2:57 PM.  The changes appear to be iterative refinements to the component's UI, with no significant structural alterations.  The code consistently uses a functional component structure and relies heavily on inline styling with Tailwind CSS.  The repeated nature of the code suggests incremental adjustments to styling and layout.  There is a chat section which displays a list of chats with user information.  The timestamps suggest a period of focused development and testing of the UI.


## 4:01:18 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `ChooseExpert.js` on April 15th, 2025, between 3:06 PM and 3:57 PM.  The code consistently remains largely unchanged, suggesting minor modifications or formatting adjustments rather than substantial functional alterations.  The majority of the changes seem to involve comments (`//`), indicating potential debugging or documentation updates. The file contains ReactJS code, utilizing components for styling and user interface elements such as  input fields, buttons, and icons from the `lucide-react` library.  There's a section that appears to render a chat list, fetching data that includes names, verification statuses, ratings, messages, and prices from an array of objects. A progress tracker is also present, illustrating the stages of a project.  While there are multiple timestamps, the actual code content remains visually identical across all entries.  This suggests a potential issue with the logging process, where only the timestamp is updated without reflecting actual code changes.
