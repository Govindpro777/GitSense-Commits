# Activity Summary for 4/15/2025

## 5:04:39 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `ChooseExpert.js`, a React component for a landing page likely related to an expert-finding platform.  The most significant changes involve responsive design adjustments and a complete removal and then reintroduction of the component's code.

The initial commits (1:32 AM) show a component with sections for `ProjectDetails`, including form elements for subject area, project type, deadline, word count, and an "Express Project" option.  There's also a chat section displaying a list of experts with their details. A progress tracker visually represents the project's workflow stages.

Between 1:32 AM and 1:49 AM, the entire `ChooseExpert.js` component was commented out, suggesting a major rework or temporary removal during development.  This is a significant change indicating potential restructuring.

The final commit (2:03 AM) shows the component restored but significantly altered. The most notable change is the addition of responsive design features using Tailwind CSS classes  (e.g., `2xs:mt-0`, `md:text-[16px]`).  Various text sizes, padding, margins, and component sizes are adjusted based on screen size.  The progress tracker is also redesigned to be more responsive.  The changes suggest the component now adapts better to various screen sizes for better user experience. There are no other significant changes outside of styling and responsive design elements.
