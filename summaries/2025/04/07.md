# Activity Summary for 4/7/2025

## 2:14:56 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ReviewCard.js` between 1:34 AM and 1:53 AM on April 7, 2025.  The file contains React components for displaying reviews, including a carousel (`ReviewsCarousel`), individual review cards (`ReviewCard`), platform badges (`PlatformBadge`), and star rating components (`Star`).  The primary focus of the changes appears to be styling adjustments.

Initially, the `ReviewCard` component's dimensions were not explicitly set.  Subsequent commits progressively added and refined CSS classes to control the width and height of the review cards, particularly for different screen sizes (`w-[394px] h-[190px] md:w-[370px] md:h-[218px]`). The border-radius was changed from `rounded-lg` to `rounded-[16px]`. The platform icon container (`div` within `ReviewCard`) also received explicit width and height styling (`w-[41px] h-[41px]`).


Finally, at 1:46 AM and again at 1:53 AM, the entire component was commented out, suggesting a potential temporary removal or complete replacement of the review section.  The consistent use of `Image` from `next/image` throughout the component indicates the use of images for icons and other visual elements. The `switch` statements within `getPlatformImage` and `getPlatformIcon` indicate the use of platform-specific images.  No changes were observed in the underlying review data or logic itself.


## 3:15:02 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `ReviewCard.js`, a React component seemingly responsible for displaying review cards on a landing page.  The changes primarily involve restructuring the component to create a reviews carousel (`ReviewsCarousel`) that dynamically adjusts the number of displayed cards based on screen size.

Early timestamps (between 2:34 AM and 2:49 AM) show the initial commented-out code of the component, which was likely a static display of review cards.  There was no significant change in content during this period, only the timestamps showing multiple saves of the same commented-out code.

The significant changes occur between  2:50 AM and 3:14 AM.  During this time, the component is refactored into a functional component using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.  Key improvements include:

* **Responsive Design:** The carousel now displays 3 reviews on larger screens and 1 on smaller screens, adapting to the viewport size using `window.innerWidth` and an `useEffect` hook to handle window resize events.
* **Data Consolidation:** The code now uses a single source for platform data (`platforms` array) and generates review data (`reviews` array) based on this information.  This improves maintainability and consistency.
* **Image Path Management:** An `imagePaths` object is introduced to manage paths for platform logos and star rating icons. This allows for easy updates to image locations.
* **Reusable Components:**  `ReviewCard` and `PlatformBadge` components are created to improve code organization and reusability.
* **Improved Star Rating Display:**  Instead of using SVGs directly, the star ratings are now rendered using `<Image>` components, leveraging the `imagePaths` object for dynamically selecting filled and empty star images, enhancing customization for each platform.
* **Navigation:** Clear `handleNext` and `handlePrev` functions control the carousel navigation.

The final version (`3:14 AM`) is a complete and well-structured carousel, implementing responsive design, efficient data handling, and reusable components.  The use of `Image` components from `next/image` for both logos and stars suggests optimization for image loading and performance within a Next.js application.


## 12:08:00 PM
The log shows several React component updates to a homework landing page (`page.jsx`) and its associated components between 11:12 AM and 11:35 AM on April 7, 2025.

`page.jsx` underwent two significant changes.  The first (11:12 AM)  involved setting up the basic page structure, conditionally rendering a community or landing navbar based on authentication status, and including components such as `HomeworkBanner`, `TrustHomework`, `HowItWorks`, `ReachoutExperts`, `StudyBay`, `FAQHomework`, and `Footer`. `ReviewsCarousel` and `ClaimOffer` were initially included but commented out.  The second update (11:35 AM) removed  `ReviewsCarousel` and `ClaimOffer` completely, suggesting these features were either temporarily disabled or removed from the page.

`How-It-Works.js` (11:29 AM) details a three-step process,  each step being a styled component with an illustration.  The code uses extensive styling with Tailwind CSS.

`StudyBay.js` (11:29 AM) implements a carousel showcasing four features with images and descriptions,  providing a smooth animation between slides.  It also utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and `next/image` for image rendering.


`ReviewCard.js` had three consecutive entries with no code at 11:33 AM, indicating that either no changes were made during these specific timestamps or the commit was empty.

`ClaimOffer.js` shows no code, suggesting it might be an empty file or placeholder at 11:34 AM.


The overall pattern is the development of a homework-focused landing page with several supporting components, showing a staged approach to building the features, with some components added and then removed during the logged period.  The consistent use of Tailwind CSS and Next.js's `Image` component is notable.
