# Activity Summary for 4/7/2025

## 2:14:56 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ReviewCard.js` between 1:34 AM and 1:53 AM on April 7, 2025.  The file contains React components for displaying reviews, including a carousel (`ReviewsCarousel`), individual review cards (`ReviewCard`), platform badges (`PlatformBadge`), and star rating components (`Star`).  The primary focus of the changes appears to be styling adjustments.

Initially, the `ReviewCard` component's dimensions were not explicitly set.  Subsequent commits progressively added and refined CSS classes to control the width and height of the review cards, particularly for different screen sizes (`w-[394px] h-[190px] md:w-[370px] md:h-[218px]`). The border-radius was changed from `rounded-lg` to `rounded-[16px]`. The platform icon container (`div` within `ReviewCard`) also received explicit width and height styling (`w-[41px] h-[41px]`).


Finally, at 1:46 AM and again at 1:53 AM, the entire component was commented out, suggesting a potential temporary removal or complete replacement of the review section.  The consistent use of `Image` from `next/image` throughout the component indicates the use of images for icons and other visual elements. The `switch` statements within `getPlatformImage` and `getPlatformIcon` indicate the use of platform-specific images.  No changes were observed in the underlying review data or logic itself.
