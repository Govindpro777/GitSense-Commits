# Activity Summary for 4/4/2025

## 12:39:27 AM
The `graphics.controller.js` file (updated 4/4/2025, 12:27:59 AM)  is a backend controller for managing graphics orders.  Key functions include `createOrder`, which handles order creation, assigning it to an available graphics user (or accepting pre-assigned users), uploading images using `localFileUpload`, creating a corresponding work queue item, and scheduling the order for processing using Agenda.  It also includes functions to retrieve pending orders (`getPendingOrders`), reassign unassigned orders (`reassignUnassignedOrders`), and retrieve a user's assigned orders (`getUserAssignedOrders`).  The controller uses Mongoose for database interactions, and incorporates error handling and transactions for data integrity.  A significant portion of the code focuses on assigning orders to available graphics users based on their current workload, using aggregation to query the database for the least busy user.  Notification sending (`sendAssignmentNotification`) is implemented but lacks concrete implementation details.  Priority and estimated completion time are calculated based on order requirements.

The `Orders.jsx` file (updated 4/4/2025, 12:36:03 AM) is a frontend component for displaying and managing orders. It fetches order data from a backend API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/assigned` for graphics users, `/api/v1/admin/getOrders` otherwise), dynamically renders an order table or cards based on screen size, and provides functionalities for creating, editing, deleting, and previewing orders.  The component uses `useState` hooks extensively for managing component state.  Conditional rendering is employed based on the user's account type (`Graphics` or otherwise) to show relevant actions (e.g., status update for graphics users, delete button for admins). The component handles loading states effectively.  It fetches images dynamically from the backend based on the environment variable `VITE_BASE_URL`.  The status of orders is visually represented using color-coded spans. The component allows filtering by search query and order status.
