# Activity Summary for 4/30/2025

## 12:50:11 AM
The provided log shows two nearly identical versions of `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\Orders.jsx`, with a 1 minute and 39 second time difference between commits (4/29/2025, 11:50:57 PM and 4/29/2025, 11:51:36 PM).  The code itself is a React component responsible for displaying and managing a list of orders.  The component handles various actions including fetching, creating, updating, deleting, and viewing order details. It uses a socket connection for real-time status updates and includes pagination and an advanced search functionality.  The only noticeable difference between the two versions is the absence of commented-out code in the second version. The commented-out code was a `getStatusColor` function, that has been replaced with a new version that handles a wider range of order statuses. The new `getStatusColor` function includes statuses for different stages of the order process (graphics, admin, cutout, and accounts) each with specific color coding.

The log shows a series of edits to `Auction.js`, a React component likely part of a larger project's landing page.  The primary focus of the changes revolves around improving the user interface and adding routing functionality.

Initially, the component lacked the necessary `useRouter` import from `next/router`, preventing navigation to different homework sections. This was corrected around 10:20:06 AM.  The navigation logic itself was refactored between 10:19:11 AM and 10:31:02 AM, changing from individual `onClick` handlers for each step in a progress tracker to a centralized `handleStepClick` function using a `switch` statement. This change improves code maintainability and readability.  Around the same time, the styling for the progress tracker steps was also refined, and a `cursor-pointer` class was added.


At 10:32:09 AM, `"use client"` was added to the top of the file. This is a Next.js directive indicating that the component should be rendered on the client-side, enabling features like client-side routing.

A separate file, `layout.jsx`, shows a brief addition and then removal of some simple HTML, suggesting experimentation or testing unrelated to the main functionality of `Auction.js`.  The changes to this file happened at 10:38:30 AM and 10:39:20 AM.  The `layout.jsx` file appears to be a Next.js layout component.
