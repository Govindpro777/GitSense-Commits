# Activity Summary for 4/30/2025

## 12:50:11 AM
The provided log shows two nearly identical versions of `c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\Orders.jsx`, with a 1 minute and 39 second time difference between commits (4/29/2025, 11:50:57 PM and 4/29/2025, 11:51:36 PM).  The code itself is a React component responsible for displaying and managing a list of orders.  The component handles various actions including fetching, creating, updating, deleting, and viewing order details. It uses a socket connection for real-time status updates and includes pagination and an advanced search functionality.  The only noticeable difference between the two versions is the absence of commented-out code in the second version. The commented-out code was a `getStatusColor` function, that has been replaced with a new version that handles a wider range of order statuses. The new `getStatusColor` function includes statuses for different stages of the order process (graphics, admin, cutout, and accounts) each with specific color coding.
