# Activity Summary for 4/27/2025

## 1:07:11 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ActiveCard.js`, a React component, between 12:19 PM and 1:06 PM on April 27, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on responsive design adjustments using Tailwind CSS classes.  There's a recurring pattern of adding or modifying `md:` and `lg:` prefixes to Tailwind classes to control styling for medium and large screens, respectively.  The initial version had commented-out code, which was subsequently removed in later revisions.  Several revisions involved minor tweaks to spacing (`gap-4`, `gap-6`, etc.) and text sizes (`text-[14px]`, `text-[16px]`, etc.).  Around 12:23 PM, a significant restructuring of the layout occurred, changing from a `flex flex-col md:flex-row` structure to a more refined approach that improved responsiveness.  A red border was added to the right section around 12:24 PM as a debugging aid,  then removed later. Finally, the layout of the expert section and the placement of the Best Offer badge and buttons were adjusted for better presentation and responsiveness. The changes consistently aim to improve the component's appearance and functionality across different screen sizes.
