# Activity Summary for 4/27/2025

## 1:07:11 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to `ActiveCard.js`, a React component, between 12:19 PM and 1:06 PM on April 27, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on responsive design adjustments using Tailwind CSS classes.  There's a recurring pattern of adding or modifying `md:` and `lg:` prefixes to Tailwind classes to control styling for medium and large screens, respectively.  The initial version had commented-out code, which was subsequently removed in later revisions.  Several revisions involved minor tweaks to spacing (`gap-4`, `gap-6`, etc.) and text sizes (`text-[14px]`, `text-[16px]`, etc.).  Around 12:23 PM, a significant restructuring of the layout occurred, changing from a `flex flex-col md:flex-row` structure to a more refined approach that improved responsiveness.  A red border was added to the right section around 12:24 PM as a debugging aid,  then removed later. Finally, the layout of the expert section and the placement of the Best Offer badge and buttons were adjusted for better presentation and responsiveness. The changes consistently aim to improve the component's appearance and functionality across different screen sizes.


## 5:09:00 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `ActiveProject.js` between 1:07 PM and 1:13 PM on April 27, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, which displays active projects with filtering and a sidebar, remains consistent throughout all revisions.  The changes primarily involve minor adjustments to the UI, specifically within the component's layout and styling.

Notable changes include:

* **1:07:33 PM:** Initial commit of the `ActiveProject` component. This version establishes the basic structure, including tabs, a search bar, project cards (`ActiveCard` component), and a sidebar with user profile and calendar.

* **1:07:59 PM - 1:08:35 PM:**  These commits involve small styling changes.  The most significant alteration is the movement of the "Active Project" title from being aligned to the left to being aligned to the right within its container, and slight refinements to the flexbox arrangements.

* **1:09:41 PM:** No significant changes detected in this commit compared to the previous one; appears to be a minor, inconsequential edit.

* **1:09:53 PM - 1:13:53 PM:** A series of commits focus on adjustments to the styling of the crown icon (`/landing-page/Vector1.svg`) within the header. Its positioning and dimensions are repeatedly tweaked using CSS classes, with the `left` and `w` (width) class values being modified across multiple revisions. The indicator bar's background color in the tab section changes from `bg-purple-600` to `bg-[#A414D5]`.

* **1:11:19 PM & 1:11:59 PM:** These commits added `justify-between` to the header container, affecting the layout of the title and sidebar toggle buttons.

* **1:12:22 PM:** The crown icon's class receives adjustments for responsive design across different screen sizes.  (width and height changes based on `px`, `md`, `lg` screen sizes).

* **1:13:05 PM - 1:13:53 PM:** Further refinements to the crown icon's positioning, particularly on mobile and desktop layouts using media queries (`md`, `lg`).


In summary, the majority of changes revolve around iterative improvements to the visual presentation of the `ActiveProject` component with no major functional modifications.  The most frequent alterations are to the styling and positioning of elements, particularly the crown icon.  The changes are incremental, suggesting a refinement process based on design feedback or testing.
