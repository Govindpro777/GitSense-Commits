# Activity Summary for 4/21/2025

## 10:31:45 AM
The log shows multiple updates to four different React component files (`AccountAssign.jsx`, `CreateNewOrder.jsx`, `EditOrder.jsx`, `OrderDetailsModal.jsx`) and one React page file (`AccountsOrder.jsx`) and a sidebar component (`Sidebar.jsx`) between 4/20/2025, 9:22 PM and 4/21/2025, 9:38 AM.  The changes primarily involve improvements to user experience and error handling, utilizing the `react-hot-toast` library for displaying toast notifications.

**`AccountAssign.jsx` (Multiple timestamps):** This component, responsible for assigning orders to accounting users, underwent several revisions.  The most significant change involved replacing `console.error` with `toast.error` for better user feedback on errors during user fetching and order assignment. An `alert` function was initially added for `setStatusHandler` and later removed, suggesting iterative improvement in handling order status changes.  The use of `useCallback` for `setStatusHandler` and the introduction of the `useState` hook to track the `order` state improve the component's reactivity and performance.


**`CreateNewOrder.jsx` (Multiple timestamps):**  This component, for creating new orders, saw the addition of `toast.success` and `toast.error` to provide feedback on order creation success or failure, replacing earlier `alert` usage. This enhances the user experience by providing clearer and more user-friendly messages within the application context.


**`EditOrder.jsx` (Multiple timestamps):** Similar to `CreateNewOrder.jsx`,  `EditOrder.jsx` (handling order updates) was modified to use `react-hot-toast` for displaying success and error messages, improving feedback mechanisms.  The image handling was enhanced to prepend the `BASE_URL` to image paths, ensuring correct image display.  Furthermore, image previews were added with the ability to navigate between images and a full-screen preview.


**`OrderDetailsModal.jsx` (Multiple timestamps):** This component, which displays order details, received updates to utilize `react-hot-toast` for displaying success and error messages when assigning orders to display users. The API endpoint for assigning orders was corrected.


**`AccountsOrder.jsx`:** This component displays a list of account orders.  The code is commented out, suggesting it might be temporarily disabled or under development. The commented-out code shows functionality for fetching, filtering, and displaying orders along with creating bills, utilizing a custom `statusColors` object for visual representation of order statuses.


**`Sidebar.jsx`:** This component renders the sidebar navigation. The primary change is improved logout functionality by removing the token and accountType from local storage and redirecting to login.  It also incorporates conditional rendering of menu items based on the user's account type (`SuperAdmin`, `Admin`, `Graphics`, `Display`, `Accounts`, `Viewer`) stored in localStorage, offering a dynamic sidebar tailored to the user role.


The overall pattern across these changes is a consistent shift towards using `react-hot-toast` for a better user experience through improved feedback notifications and a move from using basic `alert` function calls.  There is also a clear focus on improving the handling of images and file downloads.
