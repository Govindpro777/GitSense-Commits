# Activity Summary for 4/22/2025

## 10:36:35 AM
The log shows a series of edits to the `App.jsx` file between 4/21/2025, 11:57:08 PM and 4/22/2025, 12:18:30 AM.  The primary focus of these changes was to implement user role-based routing.

Initially, `App.jsx` contained a standard React Router setup with various routes for different app pages.  A sidebar component (`Sidebar`) was implemented, with conditional rendering based on screen size for mobile responsiveness.

Between 4/22/2025, 12:03:46 AM and 12:08:08 AM, the code went through multiple versions, mostly commenting out and uncommenting the entire file's content.  This suggests experimentation or a potential rollback before a stable version was reached.

A significant change occurred around 12:06:46 AM, where a `getDefaultRoute` function was introduced. This function reads the user's account type from `localStorage` ('accountType') and redirects to different pages based on roles ('Graphics', 'Display', 'Viewer', 'Accounts', 'Admin', 'SuperAdmin').  This function was refined in subsequent commits (12:07:36 AM, 12:07:55 AM) with error handling and minor adjustments to default routes. The changes involving commenting out and uncommenting the entire file seem to have happened in between implementing this `getDefaultRoute` and improving it.

Minor styling changes were also made to the `main` section in `App.jsx`, adjusting padding values (from `p-4` to `p-3` and then `p-2` and finally `p-1`) before settling on padding removal (`p-1` removed in the final commit).

The `Login.jsx` file was updated at 12:14:47 AM and 12:16:37 AM.  These changes implemented redirection after successful login based on the user's account type stored in `localStorage`, aligning with the changes in `App.jsx`.  The most important addition is that it uses a switch statement for the various routes in the `handleSubmit` function.  

In summary, the major change across all commits is the addition of role-based routing,  achieving this with a `getDefaultRoute` function and modifying the login process to redirect users appropriately post-authentication. There were several experimental edits that involved commenting and uncommenting the entire App.jsx file before the final changes were made.  Minor styling adjustments were made to the main layout of the app.
