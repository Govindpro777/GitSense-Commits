# Activity Summary for 4/22/2025

## 10:36:35 AM
The log shows a series of edits to the `App.jsx` file between 4/21/2025, 11:57:08 PM and 4/22/2025, 12:18:30 AM.  The primary focus of these changes was to implement user role-based routing.

Initially, `App.jsx` contained a standard React Router setup with various routes for different app pages.  A sidebar component (`Sidebar`) was implemented, with conditional rendering based on screen size for mobile responsiveness.

Between 4/22/2025, 12:03:46 AM and 12:08:08 AM, the code went through multiple versions, mostly commenting out and uncommenting the entire file's content.  This suggests experimentation or a potential rollback before a stable version was reached.

A significant change occurred around 12:06:46 AM, where a `getDefaultRoute` function was introduced. This function reads the user's account type from `localStorage` ('accountType') and redirects to different pages based on roles ('Graphics', 'Display', 'Viewer', 'Accounts', 'Admin', 'SuperAdmin').  This function was refined in subsequent commits (12:07:36 AM, 12:07:55 AM) with error handling and minor adjustments to default routes. The changes involving commenting out and uncommenting the entire file seem to have happened in between implementing this `getDefaultRoute` and improving it.

Minor styling changes were also made to the `main` section in `App.jsx`, adjusting padding values (from `p-4` to `p-3` and then `p-2` and finally `p-1`) before settling on padding removal (`p-1` removed in the final commit).

The `Login.jsx` file was updated at 12:14:47 AM and 12:16:37 AM.  These changes implemented redirection after successful login based on the user's account type stored in `localStorage`, aligning with the changes in `App.jsx`.  The most important addition is that it uses a switch statement for the various routes in the `handleSubmit` function.  

In summary, the major change across all commits is the addition of role-based routing,  achieving this with a `getDefaultRoute` function and modifying the login process to redirect users appropriately post-authentication. There were several experimental edits that involved commenting and uncommenting the entire App.jsx file before the final changes were made.  Minor styling adjustments were made to the main layout of the app.


## 12:07:53 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions to the `WelcomePage.js` component between 11:50 AM and 11:53 AM on April 22, 2025, primarily focusing on refining the user interface and  logic for fetching subject categories and budget suggestions.  A `useEffect` hook was added or modified to fetch subject categories from `localStorage`, handling potential parsing errors and setting a default category. Another `useEffect` hook, likely for debouncing, ensures that a `fetchBudgetSuggestion` function is only called after a 500ms delay when relevant parameters change. This function makes a POST request to `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` using `axiosInstance` to obtain a budget based on selected type, subject, word count, and user ID obtained from cookies or the auth context.  The unnecessary second `useEffect` hook was removed in the second revision. The final revision of `WelcomePage.js` at 11:53:47 AM shows no further functional changes compared to the previous revision.

Between 11:55 AM and 11:57 AM, other components were updated:

* **`BomusReward.js` (11:55:31 AM):** This component, likely displaying bonus reward options, was created. It uses state to track the selected bonus amount and renders interactive buttons for different bonus values.

* **`DownloadFiles.js` (11:55:54 AM):**  This component was created for file selection and download functionality.  It uses an array of file objects (with IDs) and state to manage selected files. The UI allows users to toggle file selection and download selected files.

* **`ExpertCard.js` (11:56:16 AM):** This component displays information about an expert, including responsive design for mobile and desktop.  It manages a modal using `useState` and `useRef` for displaying payment information details.

* **`ProjectDetails.js` (11:56:49 AM):** This component displays and allows editing of project details.  It incorporates a modal for file uploads, using `useState` to manage modal visibility and includes components for displaying various project-related details such as deadlines and IDs.

* **`How-It-Works.js` (11:57:26 AM):** This component displays a step-by-step guide on how the application works, using images and descriptions for each step. The UI is responsive and includes buttons.

Recurring elements in the code include extensive use of React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state and side effects, `Image` components from `next/image` for image rendering, and styling using Tailwind CSS classes.  The color `#A414D5` appears frequently in styling, suggesting a brand color.  The components extensively use SVG icons for various UI elements.


## 1:07:52 PM
The log shows several modifications to React components within a project's frontend.  The primary focus is on the `ChooseExpert` component, which underwent multiple revisions between 12:38 PM and 12:53 PM.  These changes primarily involved adding and integrating new components: `LikeExpert` and `FeedbackCard`.  The `LikeExpert` component, added at 12:51 PM, provides a user interface for expressing dissatisfaction with a chosen expert.  The `FeedbackCard`, added at 12:53 PM and subsequently modified, allows users to provide feedback with emoji-based ratings and comments.

The `ProjectWarranty` component, initially modified at 12:37 PM, displays project warranty information and includes action buttons for refund or revision requests.  A notable change at 1:05 PM replaces the warranty badge SVG with an image from `/landing-page/project/time.svg`.  This same image was also added to the `FeedbackCard` component at 1:06 PM.

The `FeedbackCard` component saw significant changes in its rating system. The initial version (12:53 PM) used Lucide-React icons for rating, while later versions (1:00 PM and 1:06 PM) replaced these with emojis, simplifying the visual representation.   The final version (1:06 PM) included the `/landing-page/project/time.svg` image.


Finally,  the `ChooseExpert` component's final state at 12:53 PM integrates all components,  displaying progress steps, tutor cards, payment, and progress information, along with the newly added `LikeExpert` and `FeedbackCard` components.  Throughout the changes, consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is evident.


## 2:07:55 PM
The log shows numerous edits to three React component files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project, focusing primarily on styling and minor content adjustments.  All changes occurred on April 22, 2025, between approximately 1:08 PM and 1:48 PM.

**`ProjectWarranty.js`:** Two revisions to this file occurred within a short time span (1:08 PM and 1:10 PM).  The primary changes involved altering the border color of the main container (`#E0E0E0` to `#EF4444`) and updating button background colors for "Request Refund," "Request Revising," and "Accept Project" to more visually distinct shades.  The text within the white content box was also slightly improved for clarity.


**`LikeExpert.js`:** This file underwent extensive modifications between 1:11 PM and 1:32 PM.  The changes involved numerous iterative adjustments to styling, primarily focused on the component's layout, padding, border, and text sizes.  The most significant change was the refactoring of the component's structure for better responsiveness across different screen sizes.  The image size within the component also saw significant changes in dimensions throughout these edits. The final version moved away from multiple inline styles to more consistent class names, and implemented a cleaner layout.

**`FeedbackCard.js`:**  This file was modified extensively between 1:35 PM and 1:48 PM. The changes primarily focused on refining the visual presentation of the feedback card.  The changes involved adjustments to colors (`bg-green-500` to `#22C55E`,  `bg-[#A414D5]`), text sizes (using `text-[size]` styling), spacing (`space-y-6` to `space-y-4`), border radii (`rounded-lg` to `rounded-[8px]`), and the general layout for improved user experience. The icon within the header also got changed from 'time' to 'feedback'.  The gap between the button elements was also reduced from 4 to 2 for better visual appeal.  There were also some minor corrections of typographical errors in inline styles.
