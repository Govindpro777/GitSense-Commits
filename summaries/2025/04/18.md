# Activity Summary for 4/18/2025

## 11:35:03 PM
The log shows significant updates to both the frontend and backend of a web application, likely related to order management.

**Backend Changes (Metal-backend):**

* **`models/log.model.js` (4/18/2025, 10:36:03 PM):** This file defines a Mongoose schema for logging order changes.  It stores the order ID, changes made, and before/after images.  The use of `mongoose.Types.ObjectId` and referencing the `Order` model suggests a relational database structure.

* **`models/user.models.js` (4/18/2025, 11:30:48 PM):** This file defines a Mongoose schema for users.  It includes fields for user information (firstName, lastName, email, password), account type (with an enum specifying roles like "Admin," "SuperAdmin," etc.), and active status.  A pre-save hook concatenates firstName and lastName to create a full name field.

* **`middleware/auth.js` (4/18/2025, 11:32:51 PM):** This file contains middleware functions for authentication and authorization.  It verifies JWT tokens and checks user roles to restrict access to specific routes based on account type (Admin, SuperAdmin, Graphics, Accounts, Display, Viewer).  Multiple middleware functions handle various role combinations.

* **`routes/admin.routes.js` (4/18/2025, 11:33:34 PM):** This file defines the backend API routes.  It uses the authentication middleware to protect routes and delegates requests to controllers based on the user's role.  Routes cover various aspects of order management, including creating, updating, deleting orders, managing leads and customers, and assigning orders to different teams (Graphics, Display, Accounts).  The integration of Cloudinary (`multer`, `storage`) suggests image uploading functionality.  Several routes dedicated to file management (download, delete, etc.) for graphics and display teams are also visible, using `graphicController` and `displayController`.


**Frontend Changes (METAL-frontend):**

* **`src/components/New folder/Sidebar.jsx` (4/18/2025, 11:00:47 PM - 4/18/2025, 11:02:42 PM):**  This component renders a sidebar navigation menu.  The menu items are dynamically generated based on the user's account type stored in local storage. Several changes were made between these timestamps, the most significant being the addition of the "Viewer" role to the `menuItems` object, providing a new set of menu options for Viewer users.

* **`src/App.jsx` (4/18/2025, 11:03:20 PM - 4/18/2025, 11:05:53 PM):** This file is the main application component.  It routes to different pages based on the URL, and incorporates the sidebar and navigation components. It was significantly restructured to include a responsive sidebar, and added support for different user roles and their associated routes (GraphicsOrder, DisplayOrder, AccountOrder).  The addition of `SocketProvider` hints at real-time communication.  Multiple updates reflected the addition of new routes and components based on the added user roles.

* **`src/pages/ViewOrders.jsx` (4/18/2025, 11:04:06 PM - 4/18/2025, 11:28:30 PM):** This component displays a list of orders. It starts as a placeholder and is significantly expanded to include: search and filtering by status; data fetching (using `fetch` and handling loading states); order details modal; and image preview modal which fetches images from the backend using the `VITE_BASE_URL` environment variable.  The `getStatusColor` function adds styling based on order status.


In summary, the code changes reflect a substantial update to a web application focused on order management.  The most significant changes involve adding a detailed view of orders with image previews and filtering capabilities, refining user roles and access controls, and implementing a more responsive UI design.  The backend updates add robust features for handling orders, leads, customers, and user accounts. The inclusion of socket provider and several features suggests a more dynamic and responsive system.
