# Activity Summary for 4/24/2025

## 10:15:19 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CustomerList.jsx` between 12:03 AM and 10:08 AM on April 24, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for managing customer order information.  Early revisions (12:03 AM) contain commented-out code, suggesting a work-in-progress state.  Later revisions (10:03 AM onwards) progressively uncomment the code, adding features and refining the UI.

A key change between 10:03 AM and 10:08 AM involves the addition of a table to display items in the order, along with the functionality to delete them.  The `price` input field in the form was modified to be a text input from a read-only input. This suggests a significant UI update adding an item list.   Other changes are incremental, likely bug fixes or minor adjustments to the component's logic and styling. The code consistently uses `axios` for API calls to fetch order data and categories, and `react-toastify` for displaying messages to the user.  The component fetches order data based on `BASE_URL`, which is dynamically set.
