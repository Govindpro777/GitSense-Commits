# Activity Summary for 4/24/2025

## 10:15:19 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CustomerList.jsx` between 12:03 AM and 10:08 AM on April 24, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for managing customer order information.  Early revisions (12:03 AM) contain commented-out code, suggesting a work-in-progress state.  Later revisions (10:03 AM onwards) progressively uncomment the code, adding features and refining the UI.

A key change between 10:03 AM and 10:08 AM involves the addition of a table to display items in the order, along with the functionality to delete them.  The `price` input field in the form was modified to be a text input from a read-only input. This suggests a significant UI update adding an item list.   Other changes are incremental, likely bug fixes or minor adjustments to the component's logic and styling. The code consistently uses `axios` for API calls to fetch order data and categories, and `react-toastify` for displaying messages to the user.  The component fetches order data based on `BASE_URL`, which is dynamically set.


## 12:38:21 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the frontend code of a project named "METAL."

**`index.css` (4/24/2025, 12:01:11 PM):** This file contains Tailwind CSS directives and custom styles.  Updates include responsive design media queries for different screen sizes (max-width: 1023px, 639px, min-width: 640px and max-width: 1023px, min-width: 1024px),  adjusting padding, text size, and icon sizes based on screen dimensions.  The commented-out section suggests that it initially contained additional custom component styles using Tailwind classes (e.g., `.sidebar-icon`, `.nav-item`, `.btn-primary`).

**`GraphicsOrder.jsx` (Multiple Updates):** This component, responsible for displaying and managing graphics orders, underwent several revisions.  Key changes include:

* **Initial Version (12:14:56 PM):**  The component fetches orders from an API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/assigned`), incorporates pagination, provides search and status filtering, handles status updates via API calls (`/api/v1/admin/updateWorkQueue`), and displays loading and error states.  It uses `react-toastify` for notifications and `socket.io-client` for real-time updates.
* **Subsequent Updates (12:16:20 PM, 12:24:34 PM, 12:24:59 PM):** These updates appear to be minor revisions or attempts to debug the component. The 12:24:34 PM timestamp shows the component entirely commented out, suggesting a temporary disabling or troubleshooting step. The next entry (12:24:59 PM) shows the component restored to its previous state, with no apparent code changes from the 12:16:20 PM version.

**`Dashboard.jsx` (4/24/2025, 12:20:04 PM):** This component displays dashboard statistics (total users, orders, customers) and recent items from these categories. It fetches data from various API endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/getAllUsers`, `/api/v1/admin/getAllLeads`, `/api/v1/admin/getAllCustomers`, `/api/v1/admin/getOrders`) using `axios`. The component also includes search and filtering for leads.

**`DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx` (4/24/2025, 12:27:02 PM):** This modal displays order details, including files (CAD and images) and allows downloading them from `/api/v1/admin/file/download-all`, `/api/v1/admin/file/download-all-type`, `/api/v1/admin/file/download`. It handles file downloads, image previews and status updates.

**`UploadedFilesModal.jsx` (4/24/2025, 12:33:37 PM):** This modal displays uploaded files (images and CAD files) for a specific order.  The code is entirely commented out, suggesting it was either temporarily disabled or removed from the application. The component uses a separate API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/display/getCadFilesAndPhoto`) to fetch files and offers file downloads and deletion.


A recurring pattern is the use of `localStorage.getItem("token")` for authentication across multiple components, indicating a consistent authentication mechanism.  The API endpoints all start with `/api/v1/`, suggesting a consistent API versioning strategy.  The use of Tailwind CSS and `lucide-react` for UI components is consistent throughout the frontend codebase.  There is also evidence of a real-time update mechanism using socket.io.


## 1:38:19 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx` between 12:48 PM and 1:01 PM on April 24, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for displaying order details and managing file downloads.

The primary focus of the changes appears to be on improving the handling and display of CAD files and images associated with an order.  Specifically:

* **File Download Functionality:** A `FileDownloadManager` component was created to handle downloading files of different types ("all", "type", "single") from an API (`/api/v1/admin/file/`).  This uses a token retrieved from `localStorage`.  The improvements involved managing the download state to show loaders while downloading.

* **CAD Files Section:** The `CadFilesSection` component now correctly handles cases where no CAD files are available, displaying a suitable message.  Previously, it might have rendered incorrectly or crashed. The conditional rendering of the empty state was added in one of the commits.

* **Images Section:** The `ImagesSection` component shows images from the order, allowing for individual image downloads and a preview on click. The grid for images is implemented to handle multiple images better.

* **Data Handling:** The main component (`DisplayOrderDetailsModal`) fetches file data from the API.  The code was modified to correctly handle cases where the API response contains an array with a single element. This ensures consistent data handling.

The revisions between 12:50:03 PM and 12:51:11 PM seem to be minor formatting and bug fixes; there are no significant functional changes.  The most substantial changes relate to the addition of the error handling in the fetchFileData function and the conditional rendering of CadFilesSection.  The change at 12:54:07 PM and 12:54:53 PM are likely minor formatting changes based on the lack of substantial code differences.  The final revision (1:01:59 PM) shows no significant changes compared to the previous revision.


## 2:03:29 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `InviteTutors.js` between 1:08 PM and 1:20 PM on April 24, 2025, focusing primarily on styling adjustments to the header section.  The initial version included commented-out code for a progress tracker. Subsequent edits introduced a "Header Section" with a crown image and title ("Invite An Expert"), a search bar, and a description.  The changes involved iterative refinements to the CSS classes, specifically adjusting positioning (`-left`, `-top`), sizing (`w`, `h`, `text`),  margins (`ml`, `mr`, `mt`), and padding (`p`). The crown's positioning was particularly adjusted several times, moving it from `-left-[16px]` to `-left-[2px]` and finally to `-left-[16px]` again.  The final change shows the crown image moved outside of the header div and into the main div.  The overall pattern indicates a focus on improving the visual layout and responsiveness of the header.


Between 1:28 PM and 1:30 PM, and again at 1:33 PM, there were several identical commits to `page.jsx` with no code changes.


The `PastConsultedTutors.jsx` component was modified between 1:35 PM and 1:37 PM. This involved no changes to the core logic but the file was edited.


Finally, `CreateProject.js` was created at 1:48 PM, a simple component, and `page.jsx` was modified at 1:49 PM to use this new `CreateProject` component.
