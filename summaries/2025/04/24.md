# Activity Summary for 4/24/2025

## 10:15:19 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CustomerList.jsx` between 12:03 AM and 10:08 AM on April 24, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for managing customer order information.  Early revisions (12:03 AM) contain commented-out code, suggesting a work-in-progress state.  Later revisions (10:03 AM onwards) progressively uncomment the code, adding features and refining the UI.

A key change between 10:03 AM and 10:08 AM involves the addition of a table to display items in the order, along with the functionality to delete them.  The `price` input field in the form was modified to be a text input from a read-only input. This suggests a significant UI update adding an item list.   Other changes are incremental, likely bug fixes or minor adjustments to the component's logic and styling. The code consistently uses `axios` for API calls to fetch order data and categories, and `react-toastify` for displaying messages to the user.  The component fetches order data based on `BASE_URL`, which is dynamically set.


## 12:38:21 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the frontend code of a project named "METAL."

**`index.css` (4/24/2025, 12:01:11 PM):** This file contains Tailwind CSS directives and custom styles.  Updates include responsive design media queries for different screen sizes (max-width: 1023px, 639px, min-width: 640px and max-width: 1023px, min-width: 1024px),  adjusting padding, text size, and icon sizes based on screen dimensions.  The commented-out section suggests that it initially contained additional custom component styles using Tailwind classes (e.g., `.sidebar-icon`, `.nav-item`, `.btn-primary`).

**`GraphicsOrder.jsx` (Multiple Updates):** This component, responsible for displaying and managing graphics orders, underwent several revisions.  Key changes include:

* **Initial Version (12:14:56 PM):**  The component fetches orders from an API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/assigned`), incorporates pagination, provides search and status filtering, handles status updates via API calls (`/api/v1/admin/updateWorkQueue`), and displays loading and error states.  It uses `react-toastify` for notifications and `socket.io-client` for real-time updates.
* **Subsequent Updates (12:16:20 PM, 12:24:34 PM, 12:24:59 PM):** These updates appear to be minor revisions or attempts to debug the component. The 12:24:34 PM timestamp shows the component entirely commented out, suggesting a temporary disabling or troubleshooting step. The next entry (12:24:59 PM) shows the component restored to its previous state, with no apparent code changes from the 12:16:20 PM version.

**`Dashboard.jsx` (4/24/2025, 12:20:04 PM):** This component displays dashboard statistics (total users, orders, customers) and recent items from these categories. It fetches data from various API endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/getAllUsers`, `/api/v1/admin/getAllLeads`, `/api/v1/admin/getAllCustomers`, `/api/v1/admin/getOrders`) using `axios`. The component also includes search and filtering for leads.

**`DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx` (4/24/2025, 12:27:02 PM):** This modal displays order details, including files (CAD and images) and allows downloading them from `/api/v1/admin/file/download-all`, `/api/v1/admin/file/download-all-type`, `/api/v1/admin/file/download`. It handles file downloads, image previews and status updates.

**`UploadedFilesModal.jsx` (4/24/2025, 12:33:37 PM):** This modal displays uploaded files (images and CAD files) for a specific order.  The code is entirely commented out, suggesting it was either temporarily disabled or removed from the application. The component uses a separate API endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/display/getCadFilesAndPhoto`) to fetch files and offers file downloads and deletion.


A recurring pattern is the use of `localStorage.getItem("token")` for authentication across multiple components, indicating a consistent authentication mechanism.  The API endpoints all start with `/api/v1/`, suggesting a consistent API versioning strategy.  The use of Tailwind CSS and `lucide-react` for UI components is consistent throughout the frontend codebase.  There is also evidence of a real-time update mechanism using socket.io.


## 1:38:19 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `DisplayOrderDetailsModal.jsx` between 12:48 PM and 1:01 PM on April 24, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for displaying order details and managing file downloads.

The primary focus of the changes appears to be on improving the handling and display of CAD files and images associated with an order.  Specifically:

* **File Download Functionality:** A `FileDownloadManager` component was created to handle downloading files of different types ("all", "type", "single") from an API (`/api/v1/admin/file/`).  This uses a token retrieved from `localStorage`.  The improvements involved managing the download state to show loaders while downloading.

* **CAD Files Section:** The `CadFilesSection` component now correctly handles cases where no CAD files are available, displaying a suitable message.  Previously, it might have rendered incorrectly or crashed. The conditional rendering of the empty state was added in one of the commits.

* **Images Section:** The `ImagesSection` component shows images from the order, allowing for individual image downloads and a preview on click. The grid for images is implemented to handle multiple images better.

* **Data Handling:** The main component (`DisplayOrderDetailsModal`) fetches file data from the API.  The code was modified to correctly handle cases where the API response contains an array with a single element. This ensures consistent data handling.

The revisions between 12:50:03 PM and 12:51:11 PM seem to be minor formatting and bug fixes; there are no significant functional changes.  The most substantial changes relate to the addition of the error handling in the fetchFileData function and the conditional rendering of CadFilesSection.  The change at 12:54:07 PM and 12:54:53 PM are likely minor formatting changes based on the lack of substantial code differences.  The final revision (1:01:59 PM) shows no significant changes compared to the previous revision.


## 2:03:29 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `InviteTutors.js` between 1:08 PM and 1:20 PM on April 24, 2025, focusing primarily on styling adjustments to the header section.  The initial version included commented-out code for a progress tracker. Subsequent edits introduced a "Header Section" with a crown image and title ("Invite An Expert"), a search bar, and a description.  The changes involved iterative refinements to the CSS classes, specifically adjusting positioning (`-left`, `-top`), sizing (`w`, `h`, `text`),  margins (`ml`, `mr`, `mt`), and padding (`p`). The crown's positioning was particularly adjusted several times, moving it from `-left-[16px]` to `-left-[2px]` and finally to `-left-[16px]` again.  The final change shows the crown image moved outside of the header div and into the main div.  The overall pattern indicates a focus on improving the visual layout and responsiveness of the header.


Between 1:28 PM and 1:30 PM, and again at 1:33 PM, there were several identical commits to `page.jsx` with no code changes.


The `PastConsultedTutors.jsx` component was modified between 1:35 PM and 1:37 PM. This involved no changes to the core logic but the file was edited.


Finally, `CreateProject.js` was created at 1:48 PM, a simple component, and `page.jsx` was modified at 1:49 PM to use this new `CreateProject` component.


## 2:38:17 PM
The `UploadedFilesModal.jsx` component, updated on 4/24/2025, 2:01:01 PM, displays uploaded images and CAD files associated with a given order.  It fetches file data via a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/display/getCadFilesAndPhoto` and `/api/v1/admin/grpahics/deleteCadFiles`, using a token from local storage for authorization.  The component features tabs for "Images" and "CAD Files," showing file names, download links, and delete buttons.  Error handling is implemented for file fetching and deletion, displaying appropriate messages to the user.  File deletion is confirmed via a modal.  The component also includes loading and empty state indicators.  A `refreshAfterUpload` function allows for refreshing the displayed files after a new upload. The UI is built using React and Lucide-React icons.  The component efficiently handles both successful and unsuccessful API responses, gracefully degrading to display "No files available" messages when necessary.  The file deletion functionality prevents deleting the last file of each type.


## 3:03:33 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CreateProject.js`, a React component for a project creation page.  The most significant changes occur between  2:14 PM and 2:59 PM on April 24th, 2025.

The initial version (2:14 PM) is a basic layout with tabs, a hero banner, and a multi-card section describing the project creation process.  Placeholder images are used extensively.  A right sidebar with a user profile, notifications, and a calendar is also included (although commented out in latter versions).

Subsequent edits (2:20 PM, 2:32 PM, 2:32:46 PM, 2:33:29 PM, 2:33:40 PM, 2:34:18 PM) progressively refine the component.  Changes include:

*   **Import Statements:** Added imports for Mantine UI components (`@mantine/*`).
*   **Component Structure:** The layout is reorganized to improve readability and responsiveness.
*   **Styling:**  Significant updates to the styling of elements including the usage of Tailwind CSS classes. There's also a consistent use of rounded corners (`rounded-full`, `rounded-[16px]`, `rounded-xl`) applied to many UI elements.
*   **Image Replacement:** Placeholder images are replaced with SVGs from the `/landing-page/project` directory.  These changes were made in multiple revisions, suggesting an iterative process.
*   **SVG Integration:** Inline SVGs replace some of the placeholder images, improving visual consistency.
*   **Font Size Adjustments:** Several font sizes are adjusted throughout the component.
*   **Border Addition:**  A border is added to the cards in one of the later revisions.
*   **Removal of Calendar:** The right sidebar's calendar component is commented out in the later revisions.

The most notable change between 2:49 PM and 2:59 PM is the modification of the text color and sizes, and the replacement of the hero image with a notebook SVG.


Overall, the changes reflect a gradual improvement in the visual design and structure of the component, transitioning from a simple prototype to a more polished UI.  The use of Mantine UI and the consistent application of Tailwind CSS suggest a deliberate approach to styling and component design. The final version reflects  a complete redesign of some elements and improved UI consistency.


## 4:03:33 PM
The log shows a series of edits to `CreateProject.js`, a React component for a project creation page.  Changes span from 3:05 PM to 3:53 PM on April 24th, 2025.

The initial version (3:05 PM) displays a landing page with tabs, a hero banner,  sections explaining the project creation process with illustrative icons, and a date picker (hidden). A right sidebar (hidden on smaller screens) shows user profile and notifications (no new ones).

Subsequent changes (3:06 PM - 3:07 PM) focused on styling adjustments, primarily involving  image dimensions within the hero banner and "It's So Easy" section.  No functional changes were made during this period.


Between 3:07 PM and 3:11 PM, the color scheme was altered.  The primary color `bg-purple-600` in buttons and text was replaced with `bg-[#A414D5]` and `text-[#A414D5]`.  Additionally, minor tweaks were made to the size and position of the crown image. The text size in several elements were changed to `text-[18px]` and `text-[20px]`, and `text-[14px]`


At approximately 3:15 PM, the `DateTimePicker` component was replaced with the `Calendar` component from `@mantine/dates`.  The date picker was subsequently removed completely(3:16 PM - 3:17 PM).


Around 3:17 PM - 3:19 PM, further styling refinements occurred, notably adding padding and rounded corners to the calendar in the right sidebar. The gap between elements in the sidebar was also modified, improved.


Finally, between 3:31 PM and 3:53 PM, the entire component was commented out, and then replaced with a nearly identical version, with the addition of a mobile sidebar toggle button.  This toggle is only visible on screens smaller than medium size. The final version maintains the revised color scheme and component structure.  The overall pattern reveals iterative design and styling refinements rather than major structural changes to the component's functionality.


## 4:38:20 PM
The log shows updates across several files in a Metal application (frontend and backend).

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\index.css` (4/24/2025, 3:38:39 PM):** This file contains Tailwind CSS styling.  Updates include responsive design media queries for different screen sizes (max-width: 1023px, max-width: 639px, min-width: 640px and max-width: 1023px, min-width: 1024px),  adjusting padding, text size, and icon sizes based on screen dimensions.  Custom CSS classes using Tailwind directives are also defined (`.sidebar-icon`, `.nav-item`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-outline`, `.card`, `.main-content`, `.navbar-container`, `.responsive-text`, `.responsive-icon`, `.sidebar-overlay`).


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\models\order.model.js` (4/24/2025, 4:21:41 PM):** This file defines a Mongoose schema for an `Order` model.  Significant changes include the addition of a pre-save hook to auto-generate a unique `orderId` using a counter model (`Counter`).  The `Order` schema includes fields for customer information, order requirements, dimensions, status (with a defined enum of possible statuses), images, assigned and approved users, and timestamps.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\models\user.models.js` (4/24/2025, 4:33:16 PM):** This file defines a Mongoose schema for a `User` model.  The schema includes fields for first name, last name, email (unique), password, account type (with an enum of roles), active status, and a `created` field storing the creation date.  A pre-save hook automatically generates and stores the full name (`name`) from first and last names.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\middleware\auth.js` (4/24/2025, 4:34:14 PM, 4/24/2025, 4:34:45 PM, 4/24/2025, 4:35:31 PM):** This file contains authentication middleware functions. Multiple revisions occurred within a short time frame. The middleware functions (`auth`, `isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isAccount`, `isGraphics`, `isCutout`, `isViewer`, `isGraphicsCutout`, `isDisplayAndAdmin`) verify user roles based on the `accountType` field in the user object (`req.user`).  The `auth` function verifies JWT tokens. The later revisions primarily focus on adjusting the protected routes and access controls based on user roles.  There is a slight change in the naming of the protected routes, specifically replacing  `isGraphicsDisplay` with `isGraphicsCutout`.


## 5:38:26 PM
The log shows a series of code changes across several files within a backend and frontend application, likely related to an order management system.  The changes span from April 24th, 2025, between approximately 4:38 PM and 5:37 PM.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\middleware\auth.js (4/24/2025, 4:38:25 PM):** This file contains authentication middleware functions.  Multiple functions (`isAdmin`, `isSuperAdmin`, `isAccount`, `isGraphics`, `isCutout`, `isViewer`, `isGraphicsCutout`, `isCutoutAndAdmin`) are added, each checking for specific user roles (`Admin`, `SuperAdmin`, `Accounts`, `Graphics`, `Cutout`, `Viewer`) before granting access to protected routes.  The `auth` function handles JWT token verification.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\routes\admin.routes.js (4/24/2025, 4:40:59 PM):** This file defines API routes for admin functionalities.  Many routes are protected by the middleware functions from `auth.js`, restricting access based on user roles.  The routes manage leads, customers, orders, and integrate with different controllers for specific functionalities (e.g., graphicController, displayController, accountController).  There are multiple routes for file management (upload, download, list).

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\user.controller.js (4/24/2025, 4:50:31 PM):** This file contains controllers for user management.  Functions for user signup (`signUp`), account creation (`createAccount`), login (`login`), user information retrieval (`getUser`, `getAllUsers`, `getAllAdmin`), user deletion (`deleteUser`), and user update (`updateUser`) are defined.  The `createAccount` function includes email sending using Nodemailer.  Account creation is restricted to SuperAdmins.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\AdminOrder\OrderDetailsModal.jsx (4/24/2025, 4:51:45 PM):** This frontend component displays order details. It fetches order data and related files, includes tabs for details and files, shows order status, customer details, and requirements.  It allows assigning orders to display users.  The component uses axios for API calls.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\AdminOrder\UserModal.jsx (4/24/2025, 4:52:24 PM):**  A frontend component for creating and editing user accounts.  It handles form submission for both creating new users and editing existing ones.  Password validation is implemented.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\Auth\Login.jsx (4/24/2025, 4:53:16 PM & 5:20:15 PM):** This frontend component is the login form.  It handles user login via API calls, stores the token and account type in localStorage, and redirects to different dashboards based on the user's role.  This file underwent two updates, the second adding role-based redirection.


**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\New folder\Sidebar.jsx (4/24/2025, 4:54:18 PM):** This component is the sidebar navigation for the application.  It dynamically renders menu items based on the user's role (retrieved from localStorage).  Includes logout functionality.  The commented-out code suggests some refactoring or incomplete implementation.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\ViewOrder\ViewOrderDetails.jsx (4/24/2025, 4:54:40 PM):** This frontend component is for viewing order details. It's heavily commented out which suggests that it is either work in progress or it's been replaced.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\notification.controller.js (4/24/2025, 4:59:13 PM):** This controller handles fetching notifications for a user, with a limit on the number of notifications retrieved.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\accounts.controller.js (4/24/2025, 5:32:59 PM & 5:33:10 PM):** This controller handles functionalities related to the Accounts section. It includes functions for assigning orders to account users, creating bills, retrieving assigned orders, and managing bills.  There's also a websocket integration to send notifications upon status changes and handling of logs. Two nearly identical versions exist, suggesting an accidental duplicate or minor correction.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\service\websocketStatus.js (4/24/2025, 5:33:58 PM):** This service file manages sending websocket notifications.  It has functions to notify users about order status changes (`changeStatus`, `changeStatusByCutout`), and order updates (`notifyOrderUpdated`).  These functions use the `socketManager` to send messages to specific user sockets.

**c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\routes\admin.routes.js (4/24/2025, 5:37:25 PM):** This file, updated after the accounts controller, adds routes related to accounts functionalities (assignOrderToAccount, createBill, getAssignedOrders).



The overall pattern suggests a system undergoing active development with a focus on user roles, authentication, and real-time updates using websockets.  The frontend components are mostly React components interacting with the backend via API calls.  There's also significant attention paid to logging changes.  Some files show commented-out code, suggesting ongoing work or experimentation.  The repeated updates to the `Login.jsx` and `accounts.controller.js` files stand out.


## 6:43:49 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `CreateProject.js` component and several related files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project.  The changes span approximately 30 minutes (5:57 PM to 6:31 PM).

**`InviteExpertCard.js` (4/24/2025, 5:51:13 PM):** This file contains a `TutorCard` component designed for displaying tutor information with responsive design features for different screen sizes (mobile, desktop). The component heavily uses inline styles and `next/image` for image rendering.  It incorporates features like online status indicators, verification badges, ratings, and country flags.

**`InviteTutors.js` (Multiple timestamps):** This component,  `InviteExpert`, displays a list of tutors using the `TutorCard` component from `InviteExpertCard.js`.  Multiple revisions of this file show iterative refinements to the layout and styling of the search bar and the overall UI.  Specifically, the search bar placeholder text evolved from "John Doe" to "Search by Name, Description" over several edits, suggesting a focus on improving user experience. The height of the search input field was also adjusted (from automatic to a fixed height).

**`CreateProject.js` (Multiple timestamps):**  This file underwent the most significant changes. Initially, it appears to be a fully commented-out component.  Subsequent commits progressively add and refine the structure of a CreateProject component.  The changes involve:

* **Tab implementation:**  A tabbed interface for project status filtering ('All', 'At the Auction', 'In Process', 'Under Warranty', 'Completed') is implemented using buttons, using different background colours based on the selected tab.
* **Hero banner:** A hero banner with responsive design is added.  The image used (`notebookman.svg`) and its dimensions are adjusted.
* **"It's So Easy" section:** This section, explaining the project creation process, features cards with icons and descriptions. The number of columns in the grid is adjusted for responsiveness.
* **Sidebar toggle:** A toggle button is added for showing and hiding the sidebar on mobile.  The calendar component was initially part of the right sidebar and removed in later revisions.


The overall pattern in the changes across all files indicates a focus on refining the user interface and improving the responsiveness of the project's landing page, particularly regarding display of tutor information and project creation flow.  The frequent commits suggest an iterative development approach.
