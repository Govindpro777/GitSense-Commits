# Activity Summary for 4/12/2025

## 12:08:43 PM
The log shows modifications to two files within a React frontend project (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).  The primary focus is on the `WelcomePage.js` component, undergoing numerous revisions between 11:33 AM and 12:06 PM.  These changes primarily involve refinements to the UI, particularly the styling and layout of a modal form.  There are no functional changes apparent in the provided code snippets; the alterations appear cosmetic or related to minor text adjustments.  The `WelcomePage.js` component makes extensive use of React hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`), `axiosInstance` for API calls (presumably to fetch budget suggestions),  `lucide-react` icons, `@mantine/dates` for date picking, and `sonner` for toasts.  The API endpoint `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` is used for fetching a budget based on submitted homework parameters.

The `page.jsx` file (under `homework/Expert`) shows two main changes:  The first, around 11:31 AM, introduces conditional rendering based on authentication status, displaying different navigation bars. The second modification, at 11:32 AM and again around 11:37 AM, involves adding the `ChooseExpert` component to the page.  The component's name changes from `Homework` to `expert` in the final commit at 11:37 AM.  This suggests a refactoring or renaming of the component. The styling in `page.jsx` uses a mix of class names and inline styles with responsive design elements (e.g., `md:flex`, `2xl:px-[138px]`).


## 1:08:16 PM
The log shows two commits to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\ExpertBuddy\components\projectProgress.tsx`, both within a minute of each other (12:58:50 PM and 12:58:58 PM on 4/12/2025).  The changes are minor and purely stylistic. The first commit contained commented-out import statements and the `export default` statement was also commented out. The second commit removed the comments from these lines, thus making the imports and export functional. The component itself, a progress tracker with an annotated bibliography section and a concluding section encouraging expert selection, remained structurally unchanged.  The core functionality and visual layout of the progress tracker were not altered.


## 1:08:38 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `ChooseExpert.js` between 12:10 PM and 1:00 PM on April 12, 2025, primarily focusing on styling and minor structural changes within the component.  The "Annotated Bibliography" section was commented out around 12:12 PM. The background color of the `div` was changed multiple times, settling on `bg-[#f5f3ef]`.  There was a significant refactoring at 12:59 PM, where the `steps` array was broken down into individual step variables instead of using a map function. This change was reverted shortly after at 1:00 PM, returning the code to a version similar to that at 12:56 PM.  No functional changes were observed in the logic of the component itself, only the styling and presentation.

The file `page.jsx` shows a few minor edits between 1:01 PM and 1:03 PM on April 12, 2025.  These edits involve importing the correct `LandingNavbar` component, replacing an earlier import with the intended one. The core functionality and structure of the page remained unchanged across these edits; it simply involved correcting the import statement.
