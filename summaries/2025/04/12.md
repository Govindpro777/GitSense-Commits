# Activity Summary for 4/12/2025

## 12:08:43 PM
The log shows modifications to two files within a React frontend project (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).  The primary focus is on the `WelcomePage.js` component, undergoing numerous revisions between 11:33 AM and 12:06 PM.  These changes primarily involve refinements to the UI, particularly the styling and layout of a modal form.  There are no functional changes apparent in the provided code snippets; the alterations appear cosmetic or related to minor text adjustments.  The `WelcomePage.js` component makes extensive use of React hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`), `axiosInstance` for API calls (presumably to fetch budget suggestions),  `lucide-react` icons, `@mantine/dates` for date picking, and `sonner` for toasts.  The API endpoint `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` is used for fetching a budget based on submitted homework parameters.

The `page.jsx` file (under `homework/Expert`) shows two main changes:  The first, around 11:31 AM, introduces conditional rendering based on authentication status, displaying different navigation bars. The second modification, at 11:32 AM and again around 11:37 AM, involves adding the `ChooseExpert` component to the page.  The component's name changes from `Homework` to `expert` in the final commit at 11:37 AM.  This suggests a refactoring or renaming of the component. The styling in `page.jsx` uses a mix of class names and inline styles with responsive design elements (e.g., `md:flex`, `2xl:px-[138px]`).


## 1:08:16 PM
The log shows two commits to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\ExpertBuddy\components\projectProgress.tsx`, both within a minute of each other (12:58:50 PM and 12:58:58 PM on 4/12/2025).  The changes are minor and purely stylistic. The first commit contained commented-out import statements and the `export default` statement was also commented out. The second commit removed the comments from these lines, thus making the imports and export functional. The component itself, a progress tracker with an annotated bibliography section and a concluding section encouraging expert selection, remained structurally unchanged.  The core functionality and visual layout of the progress tracker were not altered.


## 1:08:38 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `ChooseExpert.js` between 12:10 PM and 1:00 PM on April 12, 2025, primarily focusing on styling and minor structural changes within the component.  The "Annotated Bibliography" section was commented out around 12:12 PM. The background color of the `div` was changed multiple times, settling on `bg-[#f5f3ef]`.  There was a significant refactoring at 12:59 PM, where the `steps` array was broken down into individual step variables instead of using a map function. This change was reverted shortly after at 1:00 PM, returning the code to a version similar to that at 12:56 PM.  No functional changes were observed in the logic of the component itself, only the styling and presentation.

The file `page.jsx` shows a few minor edits between 1:01 PM and 1:03 PM on April 12, 2025.  These edits involve importing the correct `LandingNavbar` component, replacing an earlier import with the intended one. The core functionality and structure of the page remained unchanged across these edits; it simply involved correcting the import statement.


## 2:08:39 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `WelcomePage.js` on April 12th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: a modal component (`WelcomeModal`) that allows users to input details for a homework request, including type, subject, word count, budget, due date, and an optional file attachment.  The component fetches subject categories and subjects from localStorage and makes API calls to `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` using `axiosInstance` to get a suggested budget based on user inputs.  JWT token and userId are retrieved from cookies or the auth context.

The changes between revisions primarily focus on the UI of the file attachment section within the modal's `popupContent`.  Specifically:

* **1:09:26 PM:** Initial commit, showing a basic file attachment section.
* **1:10:29 PM:** No visible changes in the provided snippets.
* **1:36:03 PM:** Minor styling adjustment in the `Attach File Button` section;  the `flex flex-col space-y-1` class was removed.
* **1:36:32 PM:** The `space-y-1` class is reintroduced into the `Attach File Button` div.
* **1:40:19 PM:** No visible changes in the provided snippets.
* **1:41:10 PM:** The `Image` component within the attach file button has its width and height reduced from `38px` to `32px`.

The frequent commits around 1:36 PM suggest minor UI adjustments were being iteratively tested.  The overall structure and functionality of the component remained largely unchanged throughout the logged revisions.  The consistent use of logging statements (`console.log`) throughout the code suggests a debugging approach during development.


## 3:08:44 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ChooseExpert.js` and a series of edits to `WelcomePage.js`.

**ChooseExpert.js:**

The `ChooseExpert.js` file underwent several changes between 2:21 PM and 2:31 PM.  Initially, the code defined a progress tracker using individual step variables (step1, step2, etc.).  Subsequent revisions refactored this to use a single `steps` array, simplifying the component's structure.  Around 2:27 PM,  the `Image` import from `next/image` was removed, suggesting a simplification of the visual components.  The final version uses a `steps` array and  retains the progress tracker's visual elements.  There were minor adjustments to the styling and height of the progress line (`h-0.5` to `h-0.7` and back to `h-0.5`, then to `h-0.4` and finally back to `h-0.5`).


**WelcomePage.js:**

The `WelcomePage.js` file shows a series of modifications between 2:37 PM and 3:07 PM.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be stylistic adjustments.  The changes involve modifications to various CSS class names, specifically adjusting text sizes (`text-[16px]` to `text-[14px] md:text-[16px]`), colors (`text-black` to `text-[#16192C]`), and other minor styling properties of the elements within the modal.  The core functionality of the component, including the API calls (`/api/homework/budget-suggestion`) to fetch budget suggestions, remained consistent throughout these revisions. The consistent use of inline styles (`text-[#16192C]`, `border-[#A414D5]`, etc.) throughout suggests a preference for this styling method.  The numerous updates to `WelcomePage.js` likely represent iterative design improvements and refinements to the user interface.
