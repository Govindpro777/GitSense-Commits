# Activity Summary for 4/12/2025

## 12:08:43 PM
The log shows modifications to two files within a React frontend project (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).  The primary focus is on the `WelcomePage.js` component, undergoing numerous revisions between 11:33 AM and 12:06 PM.  These changes primarily involve refinements to the UI, particularly the styling and layout of a modal form.  There are no functional changes apparent in the provided code snippets; the alterations appear cosmetic or related to minor text adjustments.  The `WelcomePage.js` component makes extensive use of React hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`), `axiosInstance` for API calls (presumably to fetch budget suggestions),  `lucide-react` icons, `@mantine/dates` for date picking, and `sonner` for toasts.  The API endpoint `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` is used for fetching a budget based on submitted homework parameters.

The `page.jsx` file (under `homework/Expert`) shows two main changes:  The first, around 11:31 AM, introduces conditional rendering based on authentication status, displaying different navigation bars. The second modification, at 11:32 AM and again around 11:37 AM, involves adding the `ChooseExpert` component to the page.  The component's name changes from `Homework` to `expert` in the final commit at 11:37 AM.  This suggests a refactoring or renaming of the component. The styling in `page.jsx` uses a mix of class names and inline styles with responsive design elements (e.g., `md:flex`, `2xl:px-[138px]`).
