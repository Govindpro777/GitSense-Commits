# Activity Summary for 4/12/2025

## 12:08:43 PM
The log shows modifications to two files within a React frontend project (`xpertbuddy-frontend`).  The primary focus is on the `WelcomePage.js` component, undergoing numerous revisions between 11:33 AM and 12:06 PM.  These changes primarily involve refinements to the UI, particularly the styling and layout of a modal form.  There are no functional changes apparent in the provided code snippets; the alterations appear cosmetic or related to minor text adjustments.  The `WelcomePage.js` component makes extensive use of React hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`), `axiosInstance` for API calls (presumably to fetch budget suggestions),  `lucide-react` icons, `@mantine/dates` for date picking, and `sonner` for toasts.  The API endpoint `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` is used for fetching a budget based on submitted homework parameters.

The `page.jsx` file (under `homework/Expert`) shows two main changes:  The first, around 11:31 AM, introduces conditional rendering based on authentication status, displaying different navigation bars. The second modification, at 11:32 AM and again around 11:37 AM, involves adding the `ChooseExpert` component to the page.  The component's name changes from `Homework` to `expert` in the final commit at 11:37 AM.  This suggests a refactoring or renaming of the component. The styling in `page.jsx` uses a mix of class names and inline styles with responsive design elements (e.g., `md:flex`, `2xl:px-[138px]`).


## 1:08:16 PM
The log shows two commits to `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\ExpertBuddy\components\projectProgress.tsx`, both within a minute of each other (12:58:50 PM and 12:58:58 PM on 4/12/2025).  The changes are minor and purely stylistic. The first commit contained commented-out import statements and the `export default` statement was also commented out. The second commit removed the comments from these lines, thus making the imports and export functional. The component itself, a progress tracker with an annotated bibliography section and a concluding section encouraging expert selection, remained structurally unchanged.  The core functionality and visual layout of the progress tracker were not altered.


## 1:08:38 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `ChooseExpert.js` between 12:10 PM and 1:00 PM on April 12, 2025, primarily focusing on styling and minor structural changes within the component.  The "Annotated Bibliography" section was commented out around 12:12 PM. The background color of the `div` was changed multiple times, settling on `bg-[#f5f3ef]`.  There was a significant refactoring at 12:59 PM, where the `steps` array was broken down into individual step variables instead of using a map function. This change was reverted shortly after at 1:00 PM, returning the code to a version similar to that at 12:56 PM.  No functional changes were observed in the logic of the component itself, only the styling and presentation.

The file `page.jsx` shows a few minor edits between 1:01 PM and 1:03 PM on April 12, 2025.  These edits involve importing the correct `LandingNavbar` component, replacing an earlier import with the intended one. The core functionality and structure of the page remained unchanged across these edits; it simply involved correcting the import statement.


## 2:08:39 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `WelcomePage.js` on April 12th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: a modal component (`WelcomeModal`) that allows users to input details for a homework request, including type, subject, word count, budget, due date, and an optional file attachment.  The component fetches subject categories and subjects from localStorage and makes API calls to `/api/homework/budget-suggestion` using `axiosInstance` to get a suggested budget based on user inputs.  JWT token and userId are retrieved from cookies or the auth context.

The changes between revisions primarily focus on the UI of the file attachment section within the modal's `popupContent`.  Specifically:

* **1:09:26 PM:** Initial commit, showing a basic file attachment section.
* **1:10:29 PM:** No visible changes in the provided snippets.
* **1:36:03 PM:** Minor styling adjustment in the `Attach File Button` section;  the `flex flex-col space-y-1` class was removed.
* **1:36:32 PM:** The `space-y-1` class is reintroduced into the `Attach File Button` div.
* **1:40:19 PM:** No visible changes in the provided snippets.
* **1:41:10 PM:** The `Image` component within the attach file button has its width and height reduced from `38px` to `32px`.

The frequent commits around 1:36 PM suggest minor UI adjustments were being iteratively tested.  The overall structure and functionality of the component remained largely unchanged throughout the logged revisions.  The consistent use of logging statements (`console.log`) throughout the code suggests a debugging approach during development.


## 3:08:44 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ChooseExpert.js` and a series of edits to `WelcomePage.js`.

**ChooseExpert.js:**

The `ChooseExpert.js` file underwent several changes between 2:21 PM and 2:31 PM.  Initially, the code defined a progress tracker using individual step variables (step1, step2, etc.).  Subsequent revisions refactored this to use a single `steps` array, simplifying the component's structure.  Around 2:27 PM,  the `Image` import from `next/image` was removed, suggesting a simplification of the visual components.  The final version uses a `steps` array and  retains the progress tracker's visual elements.  There were minor adjustments to the styling and height of the progress line (`h-0.5` to `h-0.7` and back to `h-0.5`, then to `h-0.4` and finally back to `h-0.5`).


**WelcomePage.js:**

The `WelcomePage.js` file shows a series of modifications between 2:37 PM and 3:07 PM.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be stylistic adjustments.  The changes involve modifications to various CSS class names, specifically adjusting text sizes (`text-[16px]` to `text-[14px] md:text-[16px]`), colors (`text-black` to `text-[#16192C]`), and other minor styling properties of the elements within the modal.  The core functionality of the component, including the API calls (`/api/homework/budget-suggestion`) to fetch budget suggestions, remained consistent throughout these revisions. The consistent use of inline styles (`text-[#16192C]`, `border-[#A414D5]`, etc.) throughout suggests a preference for this styling method.  The numerous updates to `WelcomePage.js` likely represent iterative design improvements and refinements to the user interface.


## 4:08:40 PM
The log shows updates to three files within the `xpertbuddy-frontend` project.  The most significant changes are in `WelcomePage.js` and `page.jsx`.

`WelcomePage.js` (4/12/2025, 3:10:58 PM and 4/12/2025, 3:11:28 PM):  These two entries represent minor revisions to the `WelcomePage.js` component.  The primary change between the two commits involves removing the `overflow-y-auto` and `p-2` classes from the `popupContent` div, subtly altering the layout of a modal popup. The component fetches budget suggestions from an API (`/api/homework/budget-suggestion`), utilizing user ID and JWT token from cookies or auth context. It handles user input for various fields such as project title, content, file attachment, word count, due date, type, and subject, updating the state accordingly. The component heavily uses `useEffect` hooks for fetching data (subject categories from localStorage, budget suggestions from API) and updating the component state based on various events and user selections.  The code extensively uses console logging for debugging purposes.


`page.jsx` (4/12/2025, 3:47:43 PM and 4/12/2025, 3:50:44 PM): These entries show the addition of a sidebar navigation to the `Homework` component. The initial version (3:47:43 PM) was heavily commented out, suggesting a transition from an older version to the newer one. The revised code (3:50:44 PM) implements a fixed sidebar with buttons for navigation to different sections of the page ("How It Works", "Find an Expert", "Featured", "Claim Offers", "FAQs").  The sidebar uses IntersectionObserver to highlight the currently viewed section.  The component also conditionally renders navigation based on user authentication status, utilizing `useAuth` and `useSelector` hooks for authentication and user data, respectively.  No significant code changes occurred between the two commits to this file.


`HomeworkBanner.js` (4/12/2025, 4:02:49 PM): This component is a landing page banner that displays a form for users to describe their homework projects. The submission of this form conditionally shows either a signup modal or a welcome modal depending on whether the user is authenticated (using a JWT token stored in cookies).  The banner includes styling and visual elements using Next.js's Image component and Mantine's Switch component. The code is well-structured, using functional components and hooks for state management. The primary update was correcting a syntax error related to the `showWelcomeModal` prop in the `<WelcomeModal>` component.


## 5:08:43 PM
The log shows numerous edits to `HomeworkBanner.js` between 4:14 PM and 4:42 PM on April 12, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on styling and layout adjustments using Tailwind CSS.  There's a consistent use of responsive design techniques (`md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` prefixes) to adapt the banner's appearance across different screen sizes.

The initial versions were commented-out, suggesting an iterative development process where the developer experimented with different layouts before settling on a final version.  Early versions included a more complex layout with separate sections for left and right content.  The final version simplified the layout, removing some sections and optimizing the styling of the remaining components.

Specifically, the changes involved:

* **Layout adjustments:**  The `flex` and related classes were heavily modified to achieve the desired layout, switching between row and column arrangements based on screen size.  Padding and margin values were adjusted multiple times.
* **Image adjustments:** The image size and `object-fit` properties were adjusted in the right-side image section for better responsiveness. A `sizes` attribute was added to the `<Image>` component for improved performance.  The image itself was changed from `homework-man.webp` to `homework-illustration.png` in one revision.
* **Text size adjustments:**  The heading (`h1`) and paragraph (`p`) text sizes were adjusted multiple times, primarily reducing the size for smaller screens.  Font sizes were refined across different screen sizes.
* **Button changes:** The button text, size, and class names ("Find an Expert" changed to "Get Started", then back to "Find an Expert") were altered.  The button's width was also adjusted.
* **Switch component changes:** The `Switch` component, initially styled as a separate interactive element, was later incorporated into a clickable div to improve usability.  The `Switch` component itself remained largely unchanged in functionality.

The most significant changes occurred between 4:32 PM and 4:42 PM, where the layout was extensively revised, a right-side image was added, and some elements were removed.  The final version retained the essential functionality (displaying a banner, a form for project description, a switch for human experts only, and modals for signup and welcome) while significantly improving its visual appeal and responsiveness.


## 6:08:41 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `ChooseExpert.js` and `HomeworkBanner.js`.  `ChooseExpert.js` was updated once, at 4/12/2025, 5:53:26 PM and again at 4/12/2025, 5:54:30 PM. These updates seem to involve adding a component which renders a progress tracker and a section displaying project details including subject area, project type, deadline, word count and an option to invite tutors. It also includes a section to display chats with experts.  The code uses a functional component structure with React and Lucide-react icons.

`HomeworkBanner.js` underwent several updates between 5:56:01 PM and 6:01:32 PM. These changes primarily focused on refining the styling and layout of a homework help banner component.  The updates involve adjustments to text sizes, spacing (`space-y`, `gap`), padding (`px`), margin (`mt`, `mb`), and other CSS properties for responsiveness across different screen sizes (using Tailwind CSS classes).  There's a consistent use of the color `#A414D5` and  `#16192c` throughout the styling. The component uses React's useState hook for managing form data (project description, human experts filter), modal visibility, and other interactive elements.  It also integrates with cookies (`js-cookie`) for authentication and `@mantine/core` for a switch component.  There was also a consistent pattern of adjustment to the text size of the elements in the form and also there was a commented out `WelcomeModal`. The functionality remains consistent throughout, which is to display a banner with a form for submitting project details, conditionally displaying signup and welcome modals based on authentication status.

Finally, `WelcomePage.js` was updated once at 6:06:22 PM. This update adds a component that functions as a welcome modal, allowing users to input project details such as title, content, file attachments, budget, word count, deadline, subject, and type.  The component fetches a budget suggestion from the backend API (`/api/homework/budget-suggestion`) using axiosInstance and displays it to the user.  It utilizes several React hooks for state management and  `@mantine/dates` for date selection.  It also integrates with the application's authentication context (`useAuth`) and cookie handling for token and user ID management. The component also displays a global popup which contains further details for entering the project.


## 6:35:34 PM
The log shows modifications to `MarketPlace.tsx` component  in a React project.  The changes primarily involve UI elements and  likely relate to a marketplace for tutors or experts.

The first two entries (5:40:11 PM and 5:40:37 PM)  are almost identical, suggesting a minor, inconsequential change or perhaps a failed commit. Both versions contain a `TutorCard` component displaying tutor profiles with images, ratings, pricing, and action buttons ("Hire This Expert," "Chat"). A `ProjectDetails` component is also present, handling project information input and an area to invite more tutors.  Both entries also include sections for app download promotion and chat functionality.


The third entry (5:41:43 PM) significantly alters the file. The `TutorCard` and other sections from the previous entries are completely commented out.  This suggests a major restructuring or temporary removal of the tutor card functionality. The `ProjectDetails` component remains largely unchanged, indicating that this section of the marketplace is being maintained or worked on separately.  This commit represents a significant change in the codebase at 5:41:43 PM.

A recurring theme is the extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling the UI components. The code also uses the `lucide-react` library for icons and `next/image` for image handling.
