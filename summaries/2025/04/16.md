# Activity Summary for 4/16/2025

## 12:03:50 AM
The log shows updates to frontend and backend components related to order and user management.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\UserManagement.jsx`**: This file, representing a user management page, underwent several modifications between 11:04 PM and 11:09 PM on April 15, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor formatting adjustments and do not reflect any significant functional changes to the code itself. The code is primarily focused on fetching, filtering, displaying, and deleting users. It utilizes React, axios for API calls, and lucide-react for icons.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\UserModal.jsx`**:  At 11:08 PM on April 15, 2025, this component, a modal for user creation and editing, was added. This modal handles user creation and editing, including password management and account type selection.  It uses axios for API interactions and includes input validation for passwords.  The modal differentiates between "add" and "edit" modes, handling form data accordingly.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\order.controller.js`**: This file, containing backend controllers for order management, was updated at 11:16 PM and 11:17 PM on April 15, 2025. The `updateOrder` function was modified. The initial version lacked image upload handling.  The updated version incorporates local file uploads using `localFileUpload`, updating order details and images. A noteworthy addition is the `notifyOrderUpdated` function call, suggesting the integration of real-time updates through a websocket service.  Other functions manage fetching, retrieving, updating, deleting, and approving orders.  The code uses Mongoose for database interactions and populates related data (customer, assignedTo, etc.) for responses.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\graphics.controller.js`**: This file, related to graphics order management, underwent several changes between 11:18 PM and 11:38 PM on April 15, 2025.  Key improvements include:
*   The addition of a `findAvailableGraphicsUser` function to find available graphics designers based on their active order count.
*   Implementation of `sendAssignmentNotification` to send notifications to assigned users via socket.io.
*   `createOrder` function uses transactions (`mongoose.startSession`) to ensure atomicity of order and work queue item creation. It also integrates a priority calculation and estimated completion time calculation for better workflow management. This function handles image uploading, user assignment (allowing optional manual assignment), and uses Agenda for scheduling order processing.
*   Functions for retrieving pending orders, reassigning unassigned orders, and fetching a user's assigned orders are included, showing a robust order management system.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\Orders.jsx`**: This file, representing an orders management page in the frontend, saw multiple minor changes between 11:24 PM and 11:26 PM on April 15, 2025.  The code is commented out throughout, indicating that the component might be under development or temporarily disabled. The code suggests features like order search, status filtering, creation, update, and deletion.  It utilizes fetch for API calls and handles loading states.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\GraphicsOrder.jsx`**: This file, responsible for displaying graphics orders on the frontend, was extensively modified from 11:27 PM to 11:40 PM on April 15, 2025.  Significant changes include:
*   The addition of WebSocket functionality using `socket.io-client` to receive real-time updates on order status changes. The component listens for `orderUpdated` and `orderStatusChanged` events from the server.  This is directly tied to the `notifyOrderUpdated` function in the backend, which was added earlier.
*   Improved error handling and visual feedback, displaying loading states, error messages, and success messages using toast notifications.
*   Enhanced filtering and searching capabilities for orders based on ID, requirements, and status.
*   Added image preview functionality.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\AdminOrder\AccountAssign.jsx`**:  Modified between 11:34 PM and 11:37 PM on April 15, 2025. This component was refactored to use a custom hook `useSocketEvents` which interacts with Socket.IO to update order statuses.  This suggests improvements to the real-time update system. The component allows assigning orders to accounting users, validating the order's status beforehand.  It uses axios for API calls and manages loading and error states.


The overall pattern across the log shows a significant effort to enhance real-time updates to the order status and user assignment via WebSockets.  The backend enhancements focus on improving the order management system with features such as automatic order assignment, transaction management and real-time notification.  The frontend improvements are focused on better user experience through improved UI, feedback, and real-time updates.
