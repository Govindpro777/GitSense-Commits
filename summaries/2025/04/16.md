# Activity Summary for 4/16/2025

## 12:03:50 AM
The log shows updates to frontend and backend components related to order and user management.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\UserManagement.jsx`**: This file, representing a user management page, underwent several modifications between 11:04 PM and 11:09 PM on April 15, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor formatting adjustments and do not reflect any significant functional changes to the code itself. The code is primarily focused on fetching, filtering, displaying, and deleting users. It utilizes React, axios for API calls, and lucide-react for icons.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\UserModal.jsx`**:  At 11:08 PM on April 15, 2025, this component, a modal for user creation and editing, was added. This modal handles user creation and editing, including password management and account type selection.  It uses axios for API interactions and includes input validation for passwords.  The modal differentiates between "add" and "edit" modes, handling form data accordingly.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\order.controller.js`**: This file, containing backend controllers for order management, was updated at 11:16 PM and 11:17 PM on April 15, 2025. The `updateOrder` function was modified. The initial version lacked image upload handling.  The updated version incorporates local file uploads using `localFileUpload`, updating order details and images. A noteworthy addition is the `notifyOrderUpdated` function call, suggesting the integration of real-time updates through a websocket service.  Other functions manage fetching, retrieving, updating, deleting, and approving orders.  The code uses Mongoose for database interactions and populates related data (customer, assignedTo, etc.) for responses.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\Metal-backend\controller\graphics.controller.js`**: This file, related to graphics order management, underwent several changes between 11:18 PM and 11:38 PM on April 15, 2025.  Key improvements include:
*   The addition of a `findAvailableGraphicsUser` function to find available graphics designers based on their active order count.
*   Implementation of `sendAssignmentNotification` to send notifications to assigned users via socket.io.
*   `createOrder` function uses transactions (`mongoose.startSession`) to ensure atomicity of order and work queue item creation. It also integrates a priority calculation and estimated completion time calculation for better workflow management. This function handles image uploading, user assignment (allowing optional manual assignment), and uses Agenda for scheduling order processing.
*   Functions for retrieving pending orders, reassigning unassigned orders, and fetching a user's assigned orders are included, showing a robust order management system.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\Orders.jsx`**: This file, representing an orders management page in the frontend, saw multiple minor changes between 11:24 PM and 11:26 PM on April 15, 2025.  The code is commented out throughout, indicating that the component might be under development or temporarily disabled. The code suggests features like order search, status filtering, creation, update, and deletion.  It utilizes fetch for API calls and handles loading states.

**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\pages\GraphicsOrder.jsx`**: This file, responsible for displaying graphics orders on the frontend, was extensively modified from 11:27 PM to 11:40 PM on April 15, 2025.  Significant changes include:
*   The addition of WebSocket functionality using `socket.io-client` to receive real-time updates on order status changes. The component listens for `orderUpdated` and `orderStatusChanged` events from the server.  This is directly tied to the `notifyOrderUpdated` function in the backend, which was added earlier.
*   Improved error handling and visual feedback, displaying loading states, error messages, and success messages using toast notifications.
*   Enhanced filtering and searching capabilities for orders based on ID, requirements, and status.
*   Added image preview functionality.


**`c:\Users\91965\Documents\GitHub\Metal\METAL-frontend\src\components\AdminOrder\AccountAssign.jsx`**:  Modified between 11:34 PM and 11:37 PM on April 15, 2025. This component was refactored to use a custom hook `useSocketEvents` which interacts with Socket.IO to update order statuses.  This suggests improvements to the real-time update system. The component allows assigning orders to accounting users, validating the order's status beforehand.  It uses axios for API calls and manages loading and error states.


The overall pattern across the log shows a significant effort to enhance real-time updates to the order status and user assignment via WebSockets.  The backend enhancements focus on improving the order management system with features such as automatic order assignment, transaction management and real-time notification.  The frontend improvements are focused on better user experience through improved UI, feedback, and real-time updates.


## 1:19:55 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `ExpertCard.js` and `ChooseExpert.js`.  The majority of changes are focused on `ExpertCard.js`, which renders individual tutor cards.

**`ExpertCard.js` Changes:**

* **Initial Commit (4/16/2025, 12:45:50 AM):**  This commit establishes the `TutorCard` component, displaying tutor information (name, country, badges, rating, bio, project completion rate) and actions (favorite, hire, chat).  It uses dummy image paths (`/landing-page/tutors/tutor*.jpg`) and dummy tutor data.

* **Image Path Updates (4/16/2025, 12:53:17 AM - 12:58:22 AM):**  Several commits successively modify the image paths used within the component, shifting from `tutor*.jpg` to `expert-1.svg` and finally adding `/landing-page/project/flag.svg` for the country flag. The image paths for the tutor's images are changed from three different images to a single image `expert-1.svg`.  The `CheckCircle` component is also replaced with a flag image.

* **Layout Adjustments (4/16/2025, 12:57:42 AM - 12:58:22 AM):** The size of the tutor images is increased in these commits from 16x16 to 32x32 and then to 160x160 pixels depending on the screen size.

* **Component Removal (4/16/2025, 1:12:41 AM - 1:13:16 AM):** The final two commits completely comment out the entire `ExpertCard.js` component, effectively removing it.


**`ChooseExpert.js` Changes:**

* **Initial Commit (4/16/2025, 12:46:58 AM):** This commit introduces the `ChooseExpert` component, which includes sections for project details, chat, and a progress tracker.  This uses  `'./tutor-card'` import path.

* **Import Path Correction (4/16/2025, 12:47:36 AM):**  A quick correction updates the import path from `'./tutor-card'` to `'./ExpertCard'`.

* **No further changes are observed.**

**Recurring Elements:**

* Extensive use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
* Consistent use of Next.js's `Image` component for image handling.
* Reliance on `lucide-react` icons.
* Frequent updates to the `ExpertCard.js` component suggest iterative design and development.


In summary, the code reflects a process of building and refining a UI component for displaying tutor cards, ultimately resulting in the removal of the component.  The `ChooseExpert.js` component remained largely unchanged after fixing an import error. The updates to the `ExpertCard.js` point to iterative design, with changes focusing on image path management and layout adjustments before the ultimate deletion of the component.


## 2:19:57 AM
The log shows numerous edits to `ExpertCard.js` between 1:22 AM and 2:19 AM on April 16, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on styling and visual presentation of tutor cards within a landing page.  There's consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes for layout and styling.

Early revisions (1:22 AM - 1:30 AM) involved adjustments to font sizes (`text-lg` to `text-[23px]`), image dimensions, and minor layout tweaks using Tailwind classes.  Around 1:37 AM, a significant refactor occurred, moving to a more structured component design using `flex` and associated Tailwind classes for better responsiveness.  The image handling was also simplified, using an array (`tutorImages`) and a more concise `getImage` function.  Country flags are now displayed using `Image` components, with a default fallback.

Further edits (1:40 AM - 2:06 AM) introduced icons for badges, using  `/landing-page/project/badge.svg`, replacing previous text-only badges.  The star rating system changed from text-based stars to images sourced from `/landing-page/project/yellow-star.svg`.  A degree icon, from `/landing-page/project/degree.svg`, was added to display education information.  Several minor style changes, including font sizes (`text-[14px]`, `text-[12px]`) and color adjustments (`text-[#640D51]`, `text-[#E38D2A]`, `text-[#6B7B93]`), were implemented during this period.  The `Completed Projects` section's font size was also adjusted.

A final revision (2:16 AM - 2:19 AM) removed the `Completed Projects` section in one instance and  modified the button hover style in another, changing the hover color of the "Hire This Expert" button.  The overall pattern shows an iterative improvement to the visual appeal and responsiveness of the tutor card component through small incremental changes, culminating in a refined design. The final commit at 2:19 AM seems to have left the `Completed projects` information out which was available before.
