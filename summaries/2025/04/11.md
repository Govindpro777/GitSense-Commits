# Activity Summary for 4/11/2025

## 5:18:12 AM
The log shows a single entry for `c:\Users\91965\Desktop\Git Hub Projects\ChatAPP\server\index.js` at 4/11/2025, 1:24:35 AM. This file is the main server file for a chat application.  The code initializes an Express.js server, setting up middleware for CORS, cookie parsing, and JSON body parsing. It connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, the connection string being loaded from environment variables.  Importantly, it includes routes for authentication (`authRoutes`), contacts (`contactsRoutes`), messages (`messagesRoutes`), and channels (`channelRoutes`).  The server also utilizes socket.io for real-time communication (indicated by `setupSocket(server)`).  Static file serving is configured for profile and file uploads.
